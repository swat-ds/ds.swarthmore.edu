Still unnamed and unpaid for, the construction of the

a four-month delay.
Originally, the plan was to start construction on the
dorm in November. Vice President for Administration

planned in fall of 2004, despite the delay. Also, the delay in

Student's child pornography
trial delayed until October
Contrary to last week's coverage, rising junior has not made a plea
BY GREGORY NELSON
gnelsonl@swarthmore.edu

The trial date for Ivan Boothe 'O4,

originally scheduled for this Monday,
has been postponed until October 2L
The Delaware County's District
Attorney office announced the trial's
delay in court on Monday. Neither the
office
nor
attorney's
Joseph
Fiorvanti, Boothe's attorney, could be
reached for comment on the reason
for the delay.
Sources close to Boothe stated that,
contrary to the Phoenix's coverage
last week which reported that he had

guilty to charges against

him, including 500 counts of possess-

ing and disseminating child pornography, those charges were instead
reduced to 100 counts, and he has yet
to enter any plea. Boothe has also
been charged with one count each of
criminal attempt to corrupt minors,
criminal attempt to unlawfully contact or communicate with a minor,
sexual abuse of children through the

THE PHOENIX

dissemination of pornography, sexual

abuse of children through the possession of pornography and criminal use
of a communications facility.

According to sources close to
Boothe, Fiorvanti may challenge the
constitutionality of the statute under
which Boothe is being charged and
the district attorney's office hopes to
prosecute. Boothe could receive up to
45 years in prison if he is found guilty
of all the charges against him, but
most of the people involved in the
case consider this highly unlikely.
On April 11, a warrant was executed to search Boothe's dorm room and
computer files after Boothe allegedly
attempted to solicit phone sex from a
New Hampshire police detective posing as a 15-year-old boy over Instant
Messenger. The officer traced the
phone number to Boothe's roommate's phone, and notified the
Swarthmore Police Department. At
the time of the search, Boothe admitted to possessing the illegal images.
He also admitted to having phone con-

versations with a 16-year-old, and 17-

year-old male when he met over the
internet, and to having phone sex
with a 17- year-old male.

Boothe's computer. Peifer said that
the pictures depicted both pre-pubescent and post-pubescent children.
Boothe is currently on a leave of
absence from Swarthmore and is living in the area awaiting trial. Boothe
began therapy last March. "I hope
that in time, I am able to correct this
part of me that I am not, and have
never been, happy about," he stated
last May.
Swarthmore's Dean of Student Life
Tedd Goundie has stated that
Swarthmore will not make a decision
on whether Boothe will be asked to
leave the college permanently until
his case has been decided in court.

September 12, 2002

The primary reason for this delay is based on the low
level of donor response to the fundraising efforts for the
new dorm and the Parrish renovation. "We're not there yet
in terms of money," Schall said. "No one's come forward

with the 8 to 10 million which is probably what's necessary
to get this thing rolling."
"Spring is feeling more like it," Vice President for
College and Community Relations Maurice Eldridge '6l
said. "If we can raise a few more millions, we'll feel secure
in moving forward."
Last April during an interview, Schall has said that the
construction delay could be as much as a year. However,
the Development offices have made much project since the
spring, and Director of Development John Malcolm feels
that they will secure a lead donor before the end of the
year.
According to Malcolm, a lead donor would be one who

A hope for peace, a
chance to grieve
Left, students held a peace vigil on Parrish steps
throughout the day, distributing information on peace
movements across the country. Above, many displayed patriotism and grief at a silent morning gathering to remember last year's terrorist attacks. The
Swarthmore Friends Meeting House also offered students, staff and faculty a place to grieve and remember throughout the day.

A year later, they're still asking: Why War?
BY SUZANNE WU
swu2@swarthmore.edu

The founders of Why War? don't think you can answer
that question. That's the whole point. It's a hook for the
second question they want to ask: "Why Not War?" The
inability to answer the first question is the answer to the
second.
That said, Andrew Main 'O5 is the perfect poster boy for
Why War?, the anti-war group and Web site founded last
year by Micah White 'O4 and other Swarthmore students
concerned about the Bush administration's military and
domestic platforms in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.
Main is one of the most active members of the group,
which describes itself as "without leaders, only with more
active and less active members." He started as one of the
organization's Webmasters, but found himself getting
more involved with Why War?'s grassroots activities after
reading widely on the United States' current campaign in
the Middle East. Main's motivated self-education coincides
with one of Why War?'s founding doctrines: that it is "the
duty of the rational person to question," as White said as a
call-in listener to a WSRN talk radio show last semester
where Why War? was the topic of discussion.

The presupposition, though, as posed by the group's
mission statement, is that rational reflection will
inevitably lead to an anti-war position, and that, according
to the group's Web site, "honestly and rationally attacking
pro-war arguments ... [will] show that this war is unjustifiable. This approach gives the meaning to our name: one
need only to question the war to become anti-war."
"The more I was educated, the more my feelings coalesced and it became clear that we're not going about this
the right way," Main added.
Pete Mohanty 'O5, Why War?'s other current organizational leader, was first drawn to the group in a similar
manner. In Mohanty's case, his initial involvement with
the organization was very much based on apprehension,
after the Sept. 11 attacks, about "the way Bush was proposing going to war: with sheer immediacy, simplification
as rationalization and without regards to concerns about

4

humanitarianism or civil liberties."

But recognition that not everyone shares the members'
backgrounds is the basis for much of the outreach on Why

War?'s agenda for the upcoming semester. As Mohanty
said, the group is preparing a "multi-faceted appeal"
including campus art, a film series, and a speaker series in
conjunction with the Swarthmore Progressive Action
Committee (SPAC), coupled with more traditional pamphleteering and letter-writing campaigns.
The first letter-writing campaign, according to
Mohanty, is on a "time-sensitive" issue that is "very much
dependent on the timetable Bush has set for attacking
Iraq." The campaign will attempt to get the anti-war position concerning Iraq and the media tensions surrounding
Iraq in the newspaper as often as possible, Mohanty said.
Why War? is also planning to work towards rectifying
some of the backlash leveled at the organization's at times
aggressive presence on campus last semester.

"The more I was educated, the more
my feelings coalesced and it
became clear that we're not going
about this in the right way."
Andrew Main 'O5
"I think we were more in-your-face than a lot of people
on campus wanted or expected," said Main, though
Mohanty suspects that some backlash was merely "masked
discontent with the political issues [raised by Why War?]."
On this second point, Mohanty and Main point out that
though the emotional tragedy of the terrorist attacks still
looms large in the minds of many, time, and the revelation
of previously classified information, have offered an
opportunity for the prevailing American sentiment to
evolve, and for new viewpoints to be more widely disseminated and accepted.

September 12, 2002

"It's far more okay to question the war since the war
started," Mohanty said. "It's a completely different atmos-

phere."

This semester, the group also plans to focus on outreach
on other college campuses. According to Jesse O'Brien 'O3
Why War? founding member, SPAC member and co-host
of a war discussion/ political rock radio show on WSRN
last semester
this is what ultimately differentiates Why
War? from SPAC, despite connections between the groups.
"The way I always saw it was that Why War? would
become a multi-campus organization, while SPAC has
always been Swarthmore-specific," O'Brien said. "And, of
course, Why War? only focuses on the war, while SPAC,
necessarily, focuses on a wider set of issues."
Even as a short-term goal, Why War? is planning to continue efforts to establish chapters not only in the Tri-Co
consortium, but also on the regional and national levels.
Villanova University sophomore Brian Sims is currently
in talks with the administration at his university about
the possibility of establishing a War? chapter on that campus.
"There is not a viable student-led peace organization at
Villanova," Sims said. "There's a vacuum that needs to be
filled by a more visible anti-war presence and which
requires a structure to further goals in more effective man-

ner."
Javier O'Neil-Ortiz 'O4, also a Why War? founding member, is currently traveling the United States, visiting college campuses and meeting with activists to combat the
fact that "many peace, activist and anti-war organizations,
including Why War?, remain regionally isolated [and] unnetworked with many other groups on a national level,"
according to his online journal. O'Neil-Ortiz has thus far
visited Clark University in Massachusetts and Roger
Williams University in Rhode Island.
The first on-campus Why War? event of the semester
will be a faculty panel in two weeks; the next Why War?
meeting will be held on Sunday at 2 p.m. in Mephistos.

about the organization, is available at:

One year after the attacks: Swat and 9/11

Foreign students face increased visa difficulties
BY MATTHEW FITTING

mfittinl@swarthmore.edu

One year after the towers fell, and the
lives of international students studying in
this country changed forever, Foreign
Students Advisor Gloria Evans thinks
most about
a
and works hardest for
Swarthmore student who's never been to
Swarthmore.
The student, who would be a member of
the class of 'O6, is still stuck in Malaysia,
his country of origin. He is awaiting confirmation of his student visa, which he
needs to enter the country, get to campus
and enroll in classes.
Time is crucial: if Evans can't find a
way to get the student onto American soil
and into classrooms by Monday, he will not
be able to attend Swarthmore this semes-

believes that the same fate awaits the
Malaysian student. "There's no chance
whatsoever," she said. "I don't think he'll
get here."
Both have been held back because of
increased security and a greater hesitation
on the part of the U.S. government to distribute foreign student visas since the terrorist attacks last Sept. 1L Each of the 19
terrorists responsible for the attacks held
such a visa, and many of their documents

To retain that ability, the college had to
participate in the Student Exchange

Visitor Information System (SEVIS), a new
system for requesting and obtaining visas,
announced at the beginning of the summer
by the Immigration and Naturalization

Service (INS).
Just yesterday, Evans received another
INS e-mail, announcing that before SEVIS
is fully operational (which the organization says will take place sometime in
October), an interim system will be set up

with a whole new set of rules and guide-

The college routinely requests visas not

The Malaysian student's difficulties
arose from the new requirement that all
males from ages 16-45 must undergo and
pass security clearance checks before they
may receive their visas.
Swarthmore itself has been forced to
deal with 'a hefty amount of paperwork,"
Evans said, simply to remain an institution
'

"We're just getting one thing after
another," she said.
The increase in security measures has
attracted worldwide attention. Yesterday,
in India, news coverage of the one-year
anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks focused
largely on those Indians denied admittance
to the United States because of difficulties
such coverage was comobtaining visas

mon around the world, according to the
New York Times.
And Evans can easily see why. "There
are so many energies being devoted right
now to security," she said.
She even experienced problems with
this year's international student orientation, an event that is usually simple to

arrange. This year, however, students
arrived on consistently delayed planes,
making a matter as simple as their pickup
from the airport problematic.
Despite the increased security, the college did not see a drop in foreign student
applications for the Class of 'O6
the number rose, in fact, to 635 this year. Of those,
44 were offered admission, and 25 decided

to attend.
Despite the increased difficulties in getting here from overseas, Evans said foreign
students still seemed happy to be at
Swarthmore. In comparison with other
institutions, especially community colleges
and trade schools, the college has experienced few difficulties in keeping foreign

citizens among the campus community.
"I haven't sensed a disquiet among the
international students," Evans said. "We
had a very good orientation
we had
more students than ever."

Professors' research influenced by Sept. 11
Repercussions felt across disciplines; shaped by personal and professional experiences
BY AVIVA ARON-DINE
aarondil@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore physics professor Frank Moscatelli normally studies the interactions between light and atoms,
but in the past year he has been quoted by The New York
Times and the BBC discussing much larger, more fateful
objects: the twin towers of the World Trade Center.
Moscatelli's analysis of the physics of the World Trade
Center's destruction has attracted national attention, partly because some of his conclusions differ from those
reached by a study sponsored by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) and the American Society of
Civil Engineers. The FEMA study claims that the planes
came nowhere near to toppling the towers on impact.
Moscatelli believes it was a much closer call.
"The civil engineers ignored the fact that the planes
were moving," he said. They compared the masses of the
planes with the size of the wind load the towers were built
to withstand and found the wind load was greater. The
problem, Moscatelli said, is that the towers had to stop the
planes, not just hold them. Figures used by the FEMA
study erroneously ignore the planes' movement and the
torque, or twist, they applied to the buildings. When
Moscatelli redid the calculation, accounting for momentum and torque, he found that the force of the planes actually slightly exceeded the towers' windfall capabilities.
According to Moscatelli, "It is impossible to say in an
absolute sense how close the towers were or were not to
falling." He believes that the reason they did not fall is
that, since they were not actually the rigid objects his calculations assumed, they survived the collisions by bending.

Moscatelli first examined the tragedy from the perspecphysics in the days immediately following
September 11, 200 L At that point, he studied the three
sources of energy that destroyed the towers: exploded jet
fuel, kinetic energy from the aircraft and gravitational
potential energy from falling building material. According
to his calculations, the last was the most devastating.
"I was reacting to things I read and heard," is how
Moscatelli explained his decision to investigate scientific
questions outside his immediate area of expertise. He also
traces his involvement to the emotions he felt as a native
New Yorker. In graduate school at New York University, "I

studied physics daily in a building in the shadow of the
World Trade Center," he said. "I'm also interested in technical things by nature. I'm a large structure buff— I was a
Titanic buff long before Leonardo and Kate."
Moscatelli's calculations have led him to some conclusions about large structure construction. Although he says
he is "more and more emotionally convinced that it would
be nice to build a very large structure on the site of the
World Trade Center," he does not believe it would necessarily be a wise idea, given the ways in which the towers'
size contributed to their destruction and the loss of life
that accompanied it.
For Moscatelli, the events of September 11 were an
impetus to examine a problem outside his usual field of
research. Swarthmore economics professor Phillip
Jefferson found the aftermath of the attacks brought new
attention to a topic he was already exploring.
For several years, Jefferson has studied the economics
of hate crimes. His research, he said, poses the question of
"whether there is any role for economic policy in trying to
mitigate hate crimes. For example, is it a matter of imple-

menting a policy that would reduce unemployment?"
According to Jefferson, he and a colleague, emeritus
professor Frederic Pryor, were among the first people to
compare socioeconomic and hate crime data. They found
that, if any link existed, it was a weak one. In the aftermath of September 1L many worried that the attack could
spur either a rash of copycat crimes or a surge in hate
crimes against Muslims. Jefferson's research sparked a
great deal of interest.
As economics professor Mark Kuperberg points out, the
September 11 attacks did not change the fundamental
assumptions of most disciplines. The laws of gravity and
supply and demand still stand, and, in Kuperberg's view, it

Julie Slavkin, Swarthmore's new Jewish advisor, understands when her students bemoan their stressful lives.
Slavkin holds this post not only at Swarthmore, but at
Haverford and Bryn Mawr as well.
"I'm basically here to.share my story with those who think
they might gain something through it and hopefully to have
the opportunity to learn from the stories of those who would
like to share with me," Slavkin said.
Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life, a support
group for Jewish students, selects candidates for member
institutions' religious advisors, and pays those advisors'
salaries.
Hillel of Greater Philadelphia, the chapter's regional
organization, recently changed its past policy of providing
Swarthmore, Haverford and Bryn Mawr with one advisor
each. Now, ithe entire Tri-Co community will have a single
advisor.
When asked how being a religious advisor at all three colleges would affect her duties at Swarthmore, Slavkin said it
was difficult to comment at the moment, since the nature of
her job will change in the course of the next few weeks. She
has been devoting her time and energy to
for the High Holidays, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.
After the High Holidays end on Monday, Slavkin will discuss her position and possible changes to it with her superiors. But her primary goal, she said, is still clear: "I'm here to
help [students] create their own Jewish community, however
they envision that."

BY JULIA POMPETTI

Tuesday night, most first-year students sat down

in their dorms and discussed how diversity played a
role in their lives.
The diversity workshop was a new event this year
organized by Associate Dean for Multicultural
Affairs Darryl Smaw, Diana Aronzon 'O5, and Elinore
Kaufman 'O4 at the suggestion of ADVICE, a student
group which includes representatives from all the
interest groups on campus from HOLA to SQU and
discusses issues of diversity and multiculturalism on
campus. They meet with the deans once a month to
share insights; last year the group focused on how to
improve orientationand has planned the workshopsfor first-year students since last spring.
ADVICE felt they needed a "common vocabulary
for discussing issues of diversity in the future so they
wouldn't be afraid of offending people," Aronzon said.
Facilitators were trained to set out guidelines for
discussion, to make everyone feel comfortable.

Upperclassman facilitators guided several activi-

ties that sought to make first-years ask themselves
"When have you ever felt like you were the only one
[of a particular group]," said Christina Vu 'O6.
Then students filled out tables that listed the peo-

ple who were most important to them and how they
identified those influences in terms of race, sexual
orientation, religious denomination and economic
status. The tables were designed as a "safe way for
people to consider themselves without having to
reveal anything they didn't want to to others,"

Both first-years and upperclassmen who were
asked if they thought a diversity workshop would
have been a helpful addition to their first-year experiences were supportive of the workshop. They all
said they had done similar activities in their high
schools or felt familiar with diversity issues. Some
said they came from schools more diverse and inclusive than Swarthmore.
Still, most held the opinion that if it opens even a
few eyes and results in even a few revelations it is a
worthwhile use of their time. In reference to the
recently held Tri-College Orientation for students of
minority backgrounds, Joanna Taylor 'O5 said,
"Every student should be provided with diversity

training."
Next year, Aronzon said, the diversity workshop

Slavkin hopes that both Jewish and non-Jewish members
of the college community will come to her with suggestions.
She wants to work with the student body as a resource.
Though not a rabbinic student, Slavkin feels a deep personal
connection to Judaism. "I don't see myself as a rabbi," she
said. "I don't see Judaism so much as a professional or academic pursuit for me as it is a personal pursuit. Within that
are all my 'Jewish' and 'general' life experiences and how
they inform one another
intellectually, personally, and in
other ways as well."
Slavkin holds a B.A. in sociodrama with a minor in Russian
from Goucher College. She cited many experiences in
Judaism. "I'm not coming with answers so much as experiences," she said. "In attempting to delve deeper into
Judaism, the road hasn't always been smooth, but I feel like
I'm always gaining in some way through the search."
Throughout her childhood and adolescence, Slavkin took
classes at Jewish schools and synagogues and traveled to
Poland and Israel. During college, she became interested in
Goucher's Jewish community, and after graduation she traveled to Siberia to work with Jewish communities there.
Many students appreciate the new Jewish advisor's wide
variety of experiences. "We wanted someone that could cater
to everyone who had different Jewish beliefs and upbringings," said Ixel Cervera 'O4, kitchen coordinator for RuaCh,
the Jewish student group.
Mike Cohen 'O5, administrative coordinator of Ruach,
said, "She's really enthusiastic about her job. She seems
really eager to learn what she will need to do to give Swat a
strong Jewish community."
"I think she's doing an incredible job. She's very organized. Everyone that's interacted with her seems to really like
her," added Ruach President Mike Morse 'O3, who has been
working with Slavkin on a weekly basis.

Inside Myrt's madness: how you got that roommate
BY CYNTHIA WU
xwu2@swarthmore.edu

Although Director of Residential Life Myrt Westphal
makes the final call, students are the ones who initiate the
process of selecting who their roommate will be in their
first year at Swarthmore.
After all of the roommate questionnaires trickle in from
students over the summer (which usually takes a couple of
weeks), the "matchmaking" begins. For the past two years,
Westphal has been the sole person responsible for finding
the perfect roommates for first year students. "I did it all,"
she said with a smile, "So you can give me all the thanks or
all the blame." After taking the questionnaires home,
Westphal spreads them out on her dining room table and
begins the matching. "It's about 6 weeks of working pretty
steadily," she said. It usually takes her until June 20th to finish this daunting task.
According to Westphal, the most important criterion for
a good roommate match is finding people with compatible
living habits in the most important areas. To achieve this,
she separates the pile of questionnaires according to
whether a person has requested single-sex, smoking, or nonsmoking halls. This year, there were a few women whose
requests for single sex dorms were not fulfilled. Usually,
however, the numbers work out so that everyone's preference can be accommodated in these respects.
Next, Westphal looks at how neat a person is and
whether he or she prefers to socialize or just study and sleep
in the dorm. After separating the questionnaires again upon
this criteria, there are usually 20-25 people in each category
(for example, smokers who don't want single sex dorms and

would prefer a quiet, neat environment). For each one of the
questions, there are people who have indicated they can "go
with the flow." If a "perfect roommate" cannot be found for a person, a more flexible
person can also make a good match. At any
rate, Westphal avoids putting completely
different people in the same room, especially when it comes to living habits.
As for the relatively mysterious adjectives, Westphal explains that she just matches people up who have chosen some of the
same. Although the two roommates may not
choose the exact same words, she tries to get
at least two or three that match. If there are
three or four people who share the same
interests, they automatically are put into a
triple or a quad. Westphal explained, "Since
roommates have to live together in a limited
amount of space, we try to find people with

visited the dorm," she said, and most requests for Wharton,
which are most common, are simply disregarded. Requests
for Mary Lyon or Willets are more likely
to be honored, although Westphal cautioned, "Don't put your hope on it... I dis-

courage people from requesting a specific
dorm because then, they have their hearts
set on that dorm. I don't want a person to
start out the year with disappointment if
his or her request cannot be fulfilled."
The same caution applies to those who
apply for a specific roommate. According

to Westphal, although some people are
good friends, they are not usually the best

"roommate material." Sometimes, however, these requests are honored in the

donates one large sum of money that would be
enough to push the project off the ground.
Usually, a lead donor is able to choose the name

of the new building as well.
Malcolm stressed that although his office is
still negotiating for a lead donor to the Parrish
project, the college's main building will not be
renamed after the renovations.
Additionally, Malcolm is optimistic about the
prospects of securing this lead donation within
the next few months. "What we're trying to do is
have conversations about the new dorm and the
Parrish project simultaneously," he said. "I'm
excited about the enthusiasm we're seeing from
potential lead and naming donors for both of

these projects."

"There's going to be a major push over the
next three months to persuade some of the major
donors in the campaigns that these projects are a
priority," Dean of the College Bob Gross '62 said.
Malcolm does not believe that the slowdown
affecting the economy has had a big effect on the
lack of a lead donor. "It's an economic reality
that those with the deepest resources are fairly
well insulated," he said.

"Most donors like to give
appreciated stock, and appreciated stock is a rare
commodity these days."
Dean of the College
Bob Gross
For those investors with their money in
stocks, however, the market is playing a major
role in donations. "Most donors," Gross said,
"like to give appreciated stock, and appreciated
stock is a rare commodity these days."
In addition to the lack of a lead donor, the college is reluctant to start building before more
money comes in because of the peripheral
aspects of physically starting construction.
"We want to make sure we have adequate
opportunity to reach out to potential donors,"
Malcolm said. "It's a truism of fundraising that
once you begin construction, you reduce the
urgency of the project in the donor's eyes."
"If you really get started on a building project
and plunge into the ground, people think you
don't have the money," Eldridge said.
In addition to the monetary issues associated
with the building and renovation project, the
college faces one more hurdle from the Borough
of Swarthmore. Recently, the borough council
enacted a new set of regulations for land use and
development. The new dorm and the current
track renovation and Clothier field were the
first two projects to fall under these regulations.
"Instead of a process that takes no time to
gain approval, it now takes up to six months,"
Schall said. He is confident that the college will
secure funding before the end ofDecember.
The college has developed detailed floor plans
for the new dorm and tentative plans for the renovation of Parrish. The stone for the new dorm
has already been purchased from a quarry.
The Board of Managers will vote on a definite
decision for the dorm construction during its
meeting in December. College administrators
are confident that the money will be there in
time for a start in the spring.
"We're committed to do our best and to keep
building,"

Schall said.

Really Bad Sex

Going into this movie, I was so naive. I thought, "It has

He acquiesces. The sex begins. Bondage, Polaroids,

Thinking back, I also should have been tipped off by the
audience. Instead of a theater full of Euro Art Cinema
lovers like myself, my fellow viewers were individual
older white men sitting discreetly apart from one another
and slouched low in their chairs. I felt like Paul Reubens.
Perhaps they had been attracted by the sign at the door

that said, "No one under 18 admitted." But how could I
know to be dissuaded by that? My favorite movie of the
summer, "Y Tu Mama Tambien," had the same sign posted
out front.
No, there's just no way I could have known going into
seeing "Sex and Lucia" that director Julio Medem had put
together two hours of raunchy, inventive, explicit sex,
interspersed with overly-symbolic visual references to
water and shots of the moon.
In some explicitly sexual movies, like "Y Tu Mama
Tambien," or even like "Sex and the City," the sex is not
the point. It's a point, sure, and what a great point it is. But
it's not the sole focus of the film. In "Sex and Lucia,"
there's so much sex that it actually begins to get boring. At
that exact moment, a dog eats a small child.
The story begins with a lovely, lanky waitress named
Lucia (Paz Vega). She had left her boyfriend Lorenzo
(Tristan Ulloa) at home, distraught. Crying on the phone to
her, he apologizes once more. It's the island. He can't get
past the island.
When she arrives home, he has disappeared, and Lucia
escapes to the island herself. Flash back six years to when
Lucia and Lorenzo met. Lorenzo was a writer, Lucia an

comes back to haunt him. It turns out that a one-night
stand he had on his 25th birthday with a stranger on the
island resulted in the birth of a girl. And that girl's mother, Elena (Najwa Nimri), has come to find Lorenzo.
First entranced with the idea of being a father to little
Luna (this is not subtle: by this point in the movie, the
camera has swept up to view the moon 16 times), and then
also by her flirtatious babysitter, Belen (Elena Anaya),
Lorenzo gradually strays farther and farther from Lucia.
Until tragedy strikes.
The entire second half of the film, following the tragedy,
dwells on Lorenzo's unwinding, Lucia's frustration,

Belen's misery, Elena's repression, and a rather private

"Breathe In, Breathe Out"
BY ELIZABETH COLLINS

ecollin2@swarthmore.edu

Ahh, the sounds of late summer: the chirping of the birds,
the lull of the leaves swishing in the trees, the gentle drone
of the clock tower, the übiquitous amplified dying cow noises of the fire station and that awful shrieking noise coming
from the unassuming classroom marked "Audition."
Okay, maybe not shrieking. In fact, this year's auditioners were quite impressed with the talent exhibited at the
music and drama auditions. Except for that one girl
Elizabeth, I think her name was. She was just bad.
Auditioning comes as a fact oflife for most theatrical and
musical types sort of like paying your taxes or that smell
that permeates the hall in Willets.
I remember my first real audition: ninth grade, tap-dancing for the spring musical, "42nd Street." My best friend at
the time, Susan, was attempting to teach me to buffalo, "flap,
flap, flap, ball change," and high kick, all while maintaining
a painfully unnatural smile and keeping her hands at that
strange angle at which dancers always seem to keep them.
Susan got the role as Peggy Sawyer one of the first freshmen to snag a lead with the school's wonderfully overzealous
theater department. I played in the band that year.
Fall plays, spring musicals and several other auditions
have passed since then. I remember the audition for "CanCan" in eleventh grade. Try doing the can-can in heels, with
a sprained ankle and a complete lack of talent. That's dedication! I remember an audition last when my trachea turned
against me. I was auditioning for District Choir, and I made
a noise that could never be reproduced by man or machine.
I equate it to the sound one makes when choking on one's
own breath, if that's even possible. I was nervous, okay?
I wasn't called back.
My first audition at Swarthmore was surprisingly painSeptember 12, 2002

less, as auditions go. I tried out for chorus. There were no
shuffles, splits, or peculiar gasps, just straightforward sightsinging.
In fact, Jenny Blumberg 'O4, of the all-treble voice a capella group Grapevine, said that most auditions at Swat are
very laid-back. "Don't be nervous. All of the auditioners
went through the same process," she said.
Both Blumberg and Alexandra Bradbury 'O5, of the a cappella group Cantatrix, insist that the most crucial part of the
audition is listening to how the auditionee's voice blends

surprisingly painless, as auditions go.
with those of the members of the group. "You may have an
excellent voice, but your voice may not complement the
existing members' voices," Bradbury said.
"The best advice I can give to someone who really wants
to be in a cappella is: audition, audition, audition," Blumberg
said. "Several of our best current members actually tried out
several times before being admitted to the group. It varies by
semester what we look for, so audition every semester."
As I've come to find, auditions and casting rarely make
the person. My friend Susan is now a stripper living in a
trailer court, and I'm lucky enough to be a freshman at what
I've come to find is the world's best college.
But she can do high kicks.
So, sign up, take a Paxil, and sing or play or act your heart
out. For a minute, don't be self-conscious, and remember the
profound words of my father: "It's just an audition; it's not a
college application."

But that's another story.

Consistency
Sleater-Kinney has been out

none of their six offerings to date

quality. This year's model, at least
in comparison to '99's "All Hands

more similar to their early work (i.e.
the modern punk classic "Dig Me

simpler ("one beat" two chords),

and a bit more rock 'n' roll fun.
That's not a good thing or a bad
thing. Or it's both.

Savvy
From their indie benchmark fashion sense to confusing
perhaps-anthems like "Ballad of a Ladyman," S-K always
seem to occupy precisely the right über-correct-yet-still-hip
position vis-a-vis such complicated issues as sex and gender politics and rock 'n' roll. Lyrically, the new record
ranges from the touching tale of a repressed coed
("Prisstina") to the call to arms/call to the dance floor "Step
Aside" ("why don't you shake a tail for peace and love").
They even take on the events of a year ago yesterday, in
the roiling, urgent "Far Away": "turn on the TV/watch the
world explode in flames/ and don't leave the house."

As announced by the titular tattoo on the first track, as
it is soon augmented with propulsive, precisionist riffage
from the band's dual-guitar frontline, S-K's long-standing
arranging formula (intertwining guitar and vocal lines,
backed by the formidable drumming of Ms. Janet Weiss)
still reigns supreme. Despite instrumental embellishments
from a couple guests theremin from Janet's ex-husband/
quasi-bandmate Sam Coomes and, most noticeably, a killer
new-wave synth line on "Oh!" (the album's catchiest tune)
the sonic palette of "One Beat" is overwhelmingly monolithic. And as amply demonstrated by their blistering set on
Coney Island this summer, these arrangements are at least
twice as effective in person as they are blasting from your
car stereo, [hint: They're playing the Trocadero on October
19.]

I search for indie records from
1983.1 like funk, soul, hip hop, disco,
new wave, and electro from that
period.

What's the best break you've ever
found?
I had an engineer play live
drums in the early '9os and recorded
it to cassette to make it sound like it

Blackalicious. etc.]? Do you
aspire to have the same commercial access for your label or are
you comfortable with its current
musical niche?
I know them and they know me.

Unassailability
I really can't say anything bad about Sleater-Kinney. For
one thing, I can think of a handful of people on this campus who would probably beat me up. For another, as a
fledging music critic, it would be rather gauche to malign
the group that practically defines the phrase "critics' darlings." (And, er, speaking of darlings; it's eminently noteworthy, and all too unusual, that I've gotten through this whole
review without mentioning that Sleater-Kinney is all
female.) So, despite the fact that their voices are still as
grating as ever, and though they still offer too little variation from song to song and from album to album for my
taste (though I do appreciate the effort), you'll notice the
all-powerful rating appended to this review: a perfect ten,

Dancing in University
City
A great place to go
One Stop Out of Swat dancing in Philly is located not in a club, but at a
neighborhood arts center.
The University City Arts League, located in (surprise)
University City, is a staple to dancing, as well as to other
cultural interests and commnity-based activities such as
classes in yoga and martial arts. Tango is offered every
Friday when the League sponsors a milonga (a milonga is
a tango social dance event).
The League is situated in a charming Victorian building near the University of Pennsylvania. As you climb the
stairs to the second floor and listen to the drifting sounds
of recorded tango music, you almost feel as though you are
swept back to the heyday of ballroom dancing. After arriving on the second floor and paying the admission fee,
you'll find two rooms buzzing with activity. The first room,
which faces the street, is used for pre-dance practicing, as
well as for refreshment breaks. The second room, located
towards the rear of the building, is the main dance floor.
Both rooms have marvelous wooden floors and mirror-covered walls. The hosts of the milonga, Lesley Mitchell and
Kelly Ray, are dance instructors who are responsible, incidentally, for introducing the Argentine tango to the
Philadelphia area. If you don't know how to tango, or are a
bit rusty, no fears: you can get a free lesson. You'll learn
the basic box step of the tango, as well as a few simple
embellishments, and even practice with a partner. Feeling
confident? Hit the dance floor! Although the main dancing
room is not that large, you'll see dancers manage to circumnavigate the room with such grace that you'll wonder
what magic is at work. In short, it's practice, practice,
practice.

performs shows regularly in New York City and has toured
various venues throughout the United States and abroad.
The three band members write most of their music, but
their repertoire consists of classic tango pieces, milongas,
waltzes, modern arrangements of old favorites, and
improvisational pieces.
Take advantage of this marvelous opportunity to dance,

Why even write about Sept. 11? All that can be said has already
been said. And nothing that can be said will ever do the day justice.
With a year behind us, our opinions remain conflicted and incomplete,
our emotions complex and ambiguous.
Our media provide us with a shared and vivid concept of what happened one clear, blue-skied day in September. Our calendars keep us
from forgetting that an event with a date as its name occurred one year
ago. Our society informs us that this, the one-year mark, is an appropriate time for reflection.
So why our confusion, why our reluctance? All of us who heard the
news that day experienced the attacks collectively, but a collective experience is no basis for a collective response. No one reacts in the same
way, no one grieves at the same rate.
The Phoenix editorial board cannot tell you how to feel about
September 11 We cannot write a guide to grieving, a ten-step plan for
"moving on" or a pithy answer to the paradoxes that tragedy leaves for
us to unpack. One year later, we still cannot sum up or break down
September 11 Our attempts at academic and political analysis are piddling. We cannot proclaim the moral. All we can do is listen to each
other.
What follows are composites of the words we heard you saying and
the words we ourselves said this past week.
"I just can't feel any specific pain any more, any of that unique Sept.
anguish
that I felt last year at this time. I thought about it a lot, then,
11
when it actually happened, and I thought about it in the months afterwards. I progressively felt less and less. Now, at the one- year anniversary, it is just a date. It's just symbolic. It's not happening again and I feel
so removed from the actual event that I can't feel anything."
"I don't understand why something that happened one year ago in a
city I've never even visited, to people I've never even met, affected me so
deeply. I still tear up when I think about it for too long.
"I can't remember Sept. 11, the day, honestly. The memory is just a
"

blur."
"One year ago, I remember sitting through class knowing that the
World Trade Center had been hit, but not knowing the magnitude of the
damage or any of the details. It was only when I walked by a Fed Ex truck
after class that I heard the news over the radio. After that, I remember sitting silently in the basement of Hallowell with other students, huddled
around the TV, not knowing who among us had been directly affected."
"So much has changed. But, at the time, it seemed like more would
change. It doesn't help being in an ivory tower."
"The attacks of last September remind us of how critical it is to overcome the gaps in perceptions and understanding across the divides of religion and culture."
"It's heartless to use a tragedy as a pedagogical tool."
"I feel that since I can't accept the institutionalized patriotism, I can't
grieve openly. My grief becomes very personal and private. I don't know
how to express it freely."
"My cynicism is stronger now."
"There were good things about the days immediately following Sept.
1L All of us went out of our way to support each other. There was a heightened sense of empathy. I had conversations with students I didn't even
know about the nature of good and evil in the world that week not over
a textbook after a study break, but over a real-world lesson screaming at
us from a TV screen in Sharpies.
"It is important to me to mark the day in a meaningful way. None of
us were unaffected by Sept. 1L Anyone who doesn't spend the day in
silent, somber reflection just doesn't get it."
"I'm from New York, but I just wanted to treat yesterday like any other
day. It's time to move on. We've been wallowing in the images and the
grief long enough."
"I can't go to another silent vigil. Enough time has passed, and now,
it's time to speak."
"I feel ashamed. The sobering reality is that all the soul-searching that
went on in this country last year following the attacks was just a sham.
Most people refuse to believe that we had this coming."
"I feel so powerless, because there is nothing I can do to prevent this
country from responding to violence with more violence."
"It's pointless to analyze my response to Sept. 11 any further. I made
up my mind last year. The only choices were sorrow and outrage, or guilt
if I did not feel either of those emotions."
"I am still so confused."
"I used to be a news junkie, but I refuse to read one more special report
on the attacks, or to see one more image of someone falling from those
towers. The media overload is disgusting. It's emotionally overwhelming."
"I watched everything yesterday. I didn't want to. But I couldn't take
my eyes off it. It's strange that I could watch footage of the most well-documented event in history and still feel incredulous."

One year of missed opportunities for change
BY LAUREL ECKHOUSE

leckhousel@swarthmore.edu

One year ago yesterday, 19 men flew hijacked
planes into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon,
and an empty field in eastern Pennsylvania. It was
an appalling act of violence, and we grieve for all
who died in the planes, in the buildings and in the

rescue effort.

Unfortunately, the events of September 11, 2001

were only the beginning. When we remember the
casualties of the past year, we also remember the
thousands of Afghan civilians killed by United
States bombs. We remember the refugees who had to
leave their homes in Afghanistan because the
United States caused further ruin in a country
already devastated by 20 years of war, much of
which we had subsidized. We remember over a
thousand Middle Eastern immigrants detained for
no stated reasons. We remember the constitutional
protections that our country claims as a definitive
part of its greatness, and that we have been so quick
to abridge in the name of an indefinite war. We
remember the destabilizing impact of U.S. military
aid to repressive governments, from Saudi Arabia to
Colombia. We remember the Middle East peace
process, which we have abandoned. We remember
every person who could be fed and clothed and educated and given adequate medical care with the
money we spend on a single bomber. We remember
those who will suffer because we will not participate
in international environmental agreements or an
International Criminal Court. We remember the lost
ability of our elected leaders to question presidential policy without immediately being attacked as
traitors, no matter how gently they phrased their
questions. We remember the missed opportunities
for change.

THE PHOENIX

It's been a long year, and a hard one. We're told
to get on with our lives, to support our country by
living a normal life. Not to worry about politics,
because the president will take care of those. That's
not going to help, and neither are the other things
our government wants to do. Bombing Afghanistan
didn't find or kill Osama bin Laden; it didn't destroy

Al Qaeda; and it didn't make the United States safer.
It just killed a lot of people who did nothing wrong
and had already suffered greatly, and made a lot of
people in the rest of the world angry. Giving Israel a
free hand in occupied Palestine hasn't made us or
Israel safer; it's just turned Arab public opinion
even further against us than it was before. Now
President Bush wants us to attack Iraq. It has nothing to do with the September 11 attacks. Invading
Iraq will certainly kill many U.S. soldiers and even
more Iraqis, alienate us even more from world public opinion and destabilize the Middle East. But it
won't make the United States safer, or the lives of
Iraqis better; and the more we turn the rest of the
world against us, the less safe we will be.
Why write about this? Why, the day after the
anniversary of such terrible events, point out what

the U.S. government has done wrong since then?
Because we can and must do better. These policies
are possible because too few of us stand against
them
at some point, even the blindest elected official can't ignore his or her constituents. And we are
those constituents. It is our responsibility to oppose
war, to work for just and peaceful alternatives. If we
will not do so, they will not happen, and our world
will remain twisted and scarred by violence and
poverty. Such a world is not safe or healthy for anyone. We must all choose peace and justice if any of
us are to be safe. This year, I ask all of you to work
together to make this a better world for everyone. It
is not beyond our reach.

The media are here to show us our
flaws and, by highlighting them, to
effect change.
September 11th? Do we as journalists do more harm than
good? Or is this simply another case of the Bush administration trying to suppress an embarrassing story? Ultimately, it
comes down to a conflict between our right to be informed
and our desire for security. There is no doubt that the NSA
leak was embarrassing for all those concerned. What is
unclear is whether or not the information was sensitive
enough to cause serious damage. Since none of us really has
any idea, the question is reduced to how much we trust our
government. And to what we value. I think many of us would
like to believe that our nation is working for something more
than just security. Security can be taken to a self-destructive
extreme, as we have already begun to see. The safety of Bob
and Jane Smith is being obtained at the expense of the guy
who happens to be named Muhammad. Apparently civil
rights no longer apply to all Americans. As for foreigners,
they should start running now.
The press has amazing influence in shaping public opinion. This is both a blessing and a curse, and I have argued
both sides. I now believe, however, that the press does far
more good than evil. Why? Because I have been co-opted. A
highly effective political strategy. But seriously. Who is out
there to monitor all the important issues, corporations and
people that we are too busy to monitor ourselves? We need
the media to ask the annoying questions, to ask who is being
detained and for what reason. The media are here to show us
our flaws and, by highlighting them, to effect change. We are
not at war, and this is not a time for deference.
The beauty of this country lies in the fact that no crime
remains hidden forever, that there are those who will seek
truth and to whom our government grants the freedom to
speak, however unpopular their words may be. Yes, the
media are annoying. It is part of our job to be annoying, and
we do it well. Do my ears look any pointier this morning?

how can we be so damn lazy? After a year of Swat-life expe

We even planned to graduate from here! After a year, we
haven't gotten any lazier but we did realize how important a
bit of laziness can be. If we had any words of wisdom for the
freshmen (even though people may say not to listen to us)
don't forget to relaaaaaaaxxxxxxx. The political science
department doesn't really expect you to read all 600 pages. A
lot of what you learn at Swarthmore isn't necessarily aca
demic or co-curricular, or even extra-curricular. It's the
friends that you make and the personal life experience you
gain, and sometimes forget the next morning, that will help
you later on in life. College is about academic and persona
growth. Just because you try to be a bit more balanced does
n't mean you are lazy. In reality, we are just... growing? We
feel better now.
Hey Bob, we have a new mantra. Instead of "I am still a

after 9/11, charity coffers were overflowing due to the
influx of donations from around the world. People who
had never stepped foot in New York City took it upon
themselves to donate a portion of their salaries to help
victims whom they neither knew nor had any real
incentive to help. Others chose to give nothing at all.
When the government decided that it was going to
compensate the victims of 9/11, it disenfranchised the
right of the American people to free speech. While alQaeda succeeded in its plan to rape the American people of their Western ideals, the government is raping
those same people of their constitutional rights.

Last time I checked, the
Constitution didn't guarantee life,

Charity organizations exist so that people may give to
those people and causes with which they sympathize.
We pay taxes to Washington to ensure a smooth and
safe setting for a free market economy. When that
money is diverted to certain individuals on morally
dubious grounds, we are all victimized.
There are plenty of expenditures to be made on
behalf of all Americans in the wake of 9/1 L The
Department of Homeland Security, while heavily
resource-dependent and ominously large, will now
exist solely to prevent future terrorist attacks. New
military technology will allow us to take appropriate
measures to divert attacks long before they cross sovereign soil.
Is our money better employed as a tool to alleviate
our guilt to the victims' families or as a means of preventing the creation of similar victims in the future?
Logic tells me to put my money on the latter.

Kudos to gansta rap satirizers
Dear Editor:
I felt I should draw the attention of the Phoenix staff
to the fact that the "alternative remix" Of Eazy-E's
"Boyz In The Hood" performed at the WRC coffeehouse
during orientation, referenced in Taru Taylor's "When
Humor Isn't Funny," was not, in fact, an original piece.
The chords and tune were written by an alternative
band named Dynamite Hack, and their remix received
major airplay on many radio stations last year (including on KROQ, the major whitekids'-rock station in the LA
area).
The whole concept of parodying gangsta rap by taking it

out of its context is not a new
one, anyway. The Gourds'

Americans as misogynistic, homophobic, violent,
hedonistic, eternally trapped beneath the poverty
line, and dependent on drugs, crime and sexual
promiscuity for all self-fulfillment, does seem offensive to me.
Music that satirizes and breaks down this image
through humor is fine by me, whatever race the creators are.
Of course, "white" culture doesn't escape these criticisms either. I refer you to

Stupid ideas don't become
less stupid when expressed

"Gin and Juice" is an even
more daring postmodern deconstruction, as well as
being damn funny. (It's a bluegrass cover of Snoop
Dogg!) I'm a fan of this kind of thing. I don't find it
offensive to African-Americans; I do find it, perhaps,
offensive to the world of gangsta rap and much of modern hip-hop. However, to equate African-American culture with a culture largely financed by white people
made to enforce white stereotypes of African-

Richard

Cheese's

"Lounge

Against the Machine" album, a
unique

take on the nihilistic

worldview of the grunge,
heavy metal, and punk cultures. It's amazing how vapid,
shallow, and destructive the
message of many artists, black or white, becomes when
you take it out of its protective shell of catchy hooks
and power chords. Stupid ideas don't become less stupid when expressed through great music.
And, of course, great music doesn't become less
great for expressing stupid ideas. Which is why I can be

a fan of both Papa Roach and Richard Cheese, and of
NWA and Dynamite Hack.

Former Div. I team hands field hockey its first loss
BY DERRICK WU

dwul@swarthmore.edu

After a stellar showing at Franklin and Marshall's preseason play-day, field hockey opened its season by eking
out a hard-fought, 1-0 win against local rival Widener last
week. The squad sought to ride the crest of victory into
Tuesday's game against Ursinus, but ultimately fell to the
former NCAA Division I team in a lopsided 7-1 defeat.
In the Sept. 4 game versus Widener, the Tide maintained possession of the ball throughout most of the game,
but had difficulty creating shot opportunities, outshooting
Widener by a slight 5-4 margin.
In the second half, Meg Woodworth 'O3 scored the eventual game-winner by slipping the ball past the Widener
goalie. "The game was a great example of a new team coming together. Every member of our team contributed in
some way," Katie Cloonan 'O3 said.
On Tuesday, the team faced much stiffer competition
against the Ursinus Bears. Ursinus, which had been playing Div. I ball since 1993, joined the Centennial Conference
this year. As a result, "three of the four classes at Ursinus
were recruited to play in Division I," according to
Cloonan.
Since Ursinus plays on a turf field at home,
Swarthmore employed a new 3-3-3-1 scheme on its grass
field because "the scheme is extremely effective against
turf teams," according to Cloonan." "It spreads people out
and allows us to make interceptions."
"Since they're a turf team [and not used to playing on
Swarthmore's rough grass conditions], we had the advantage in the first half," Lauren Sippel 'O5 said.
Swarthmore held Ursinus to one goal in the first half,
allowing only an unassisted score by Sandy Fetterman 31
minutes into the game.
By the second half, though, Ursinus had adjusted to the
playing conditions and Swarthmore's strategy. "In the second half, we were on our heels," Sippel said. "We were
making the same play over and over again, pushing the
ball up on the right side of the field. Ursinus caught on

and capitalized on our mistake. They'd score by beating
us back."
The brunt of the Ursinus attack came in the game's
final five minutes, when the Bears broke through with a
barrage offour goals. "We had a mental lapse. It was during the toughest time of the game, like the third lap of the
mile," Cloonan said.
"People got frustrated. Refs were calling crazy calls,"
goalie Jenn Hart 'O3 said. "I thought that one of the referees might have been a physical education instructor at
Ursinus."
The Garnet avoided the shutout when Sippel 'O5 scored
with 31 seconds left to go in the game. "I received the pass
from the middle of the field, and had a one-on-one with the
goalie," Sippel said. "I faked the goalie to one side and
dribbled it in."
After the game, co-captain Katie Cloonan remained

Meg Woodworth, who leads the Garnet Tide in goals this season, dashes for the ball during Tuesday's 7-1 loss at the hands of Ursinus. The Bears handed the
Garnet their first defeat of the season, and Swarthmore currently stands at 1-1 going into next Tuesday's game versus the College of Notre Dame of Maryland

upbeat despite the lopsided loss. "It was a great learning
experience," she said. "At this point we're stretching as a
team, trying new positions and new tactics. I'm happy
with the way the team played. Ursinus was obviously a
very experienced team. They were able to take advantage
of places where we need to develop more."
"It was a mental game. We psyched ourselves out since
we knew they used to be a Div. I school," Hart said.
Despite the loss, the team is still looking forward to the
remainder of the season. Since Ursinus is ineligible for
the NCAA Div. 11l tournament as well as the Centennial
Conference playoffs, the loss does not impact the team's

chances to reach the postseason. "We're looking forward
to our next game against the fifth-ranked [team in Div.
Ill], Lebanon Valley," Cloonan said.
In fact, some players feel that the loss may serve as an
advantage for their upcoming schedule. "Teams will look
at our 7-1 score and not take us seriously," Sippel said.
"The loss puts in a good position. We're not too hyped,"
Cloonan added.
The most important factor determining the team's
future, though, may be the team's confidence. "When
we're confident about our play, we're unstoppable," Hart
said.

Garnet open fall season at Swarthmore Invitational
BY MARK JANOFF
mjanoffl@swarthmore.edu
The men's tennis team completed half of its fall season
last weekend at the Swarthmore Invitational Tournament,
one of two tennis tournaments the squad has on its sched-

ule this semester.

In two days of competition, players from Swarthmore,
NCAA Division I Saint Joseph's University and Franklin
and Marshall participated in four flights of singles play
and four flights of doubles matches.
The Garnet Tide's roster featured Jayson Yost 'O3, last
year's number three singles player, who will be competing
for the first singles spot this year. Other Swarthmore participants included several veterans along with newcomers
Brian Park 'O6 and Zack Rodd 'O6. A total of seven Garnet
Tide players, including last year's number two singles
player Justin Singer 'O3 and veterans Frank Visciano 'O4
and Mike Noreika 'O4, are abroad this semester and thus
did not participate in the invitational.
Yost paced the short-handed squad, finishing second in
the flight A doubles group with his partner Park. The pair
dropped the flight A championship match 9-7.
Yost did not fare as well in the singles portion of the

THE PHOENIX

tournament, dropping his match 0-6, 2-6 to Jimmy Holland
of St. Joe's. Nevertheless, Yost seemed content with his
and the team's performance.
"It was our first match of the season. St. Joe's was pretty tough," he said. "But we did pretty well against F&M.
They're Div. 111, so it counts for something. We did pretty
much as well as we expected."
Yost was especially happy about getting some time to
sharpen his doubles game. "It was a good little warmup.
Doubles takes a long time to cultivate and get to know
your partner," he added. Most likely, however, Yost and
Park will not team up as doubles partners frequently this
season.
Park was also pleased with his level of play, though he
fell in his singles match 1-6, 5-7. "This was my first time
playing college tennis, so I didn't really have any expectations," he said. "I was happy with how I played. It was just
the first tournament, but it went well."
Park's teammate and fellow first-year Zack Rodd felt
that he could have performed slightly better, however. "I
think I could improve my serve and return game, as well
as the depth of my groundstrokes," he said.
Yost voiced his pleasure with the play of both Park and
Rodd. "The freshman are very strong," he said. "They're
September 12, 2002

both great players, and I was really pleased with how they
did, especially with Brian in the doubles. Zack also did
very well."
Despite a solid level of play from both Swarthmore and
Franklin and Marshall, St. Joe's ran away with the tournament, winning all of the singles and doubles flights.
Several flight finals matched pitted two St. Joe's players
against each other.
The remaining half of the Garnet Tide's fall schedule
will take place at the beginning of October at the
Association (ITA) Regional
Intercollegiate Tennis
Tournament in Salisbury, MD.
In the spring, veterans Singer, Visciano and Noreika
will return to help the Garnet Tide fight through a schedule that begins on Jan. 25 versus the Unniversity of

Pennsylvania.

Notes
•Dave Gentry 'O5 reached the flight C finals, but lost to
Antonio Aniello of St. Joe's 2-6, 2-6. Gentry was the only
Garnet player to reach the finals in his singles flight.
•Rodd and Justin Durand 'O5 represented Swarthmore in
doubles flight B, but lost in their opening match 2-8 to
Francisco Velazquez and Van Homer Pangilinan of St. Joe's.

'O5 and

Balance and depth. These are the two factors that have
carried the Swarthmore women's soccer team to a promising 3-1 start over the first two weeks of the 2002 season.
While many teams rely on one or two standout players,
the Garnet women can attribute their early success to the
combined play of a number of strong talents. With only
four games under their belt, six different players have
scored goals.

Tanya

Hahnel 'O5.

This Tuesday's game placed the Garnet women in a
clash with the Falcons of Cedar Crest College in
Allentown, Pa. The team knew it was in for a challenge
before the game began, as six of its regular starters were
absent as a result of academic conflicts. Brunner was
forced to alter her lineup, using some players in positions
they had never before played. Because Catherine
Salussolia 'O4 was unable to be at the game, Jessica Zagory
'O5 took on the weighty role of goaltender for the first time
in her college career.
"It came down to experience," Zagory said. "I played
keeper sometimes in high school, and I felt confident

"lt's nice to have all those people scoring," head coach
Amy Brunner said. "We have really improved our depth
over the past couple of years."
In addition, a slew of injuries and scheduling conflicts

have caused multiple changes to the Garnet lineup, but the

enough to take on the responsibility." Zagory had five
saves in the game.
In addition to Zagory, "Jordan [Shakeshaft 'os] and
Kristen [Davis 'o6] really stepped up when we were missing
key defensive players," Shavaugn Lewis 'O5 said. She
scored both of Swarthmore's goals in the 2-1 victory.
Lewis' first came less than six minutes into the game off

squad has taken both setbacks in stride.
Last Tuesday, the Garnet took on Philadelphia Biblical

University, a team they beat handily last season. "They
were a team we had dominated last year, but they were
much improved this season," Brunner said. "We started a
bit of a different lineup, but we've got the depth to do that."

of a pass from Claire Hoverman 'O3. Cedar Crest's Amanda
Schwartz answered with a goal at 23 minutes. "We pretty
much dominated the entire first half," Brunner remarked.
"There was just that one breakaway when the defense wasn't on that [Cedar Crest] took advantage of." Lewis' second
goal, off of an assist from Kristen Davis, broke the tie and
put the Garnet Tide ahead for good.
For Lewis, the ability to play "all-out" has been a long
time in coming. "It was a very physical game, which was
fun for me," she said. "It felt really good to finally play
without my knee brace."
After tearing her Anterior Crucial Ligament (ACL) last
year, Lewis had to undergo a long period of recovery and
rehabilitation in anticipation of a strong comeback this
season. "My coach and teammates have been very supportive the whole time, even though it has been slower
coming back this year," she said. "Our team seems to be
injury-prone, so it helps to have the depth that we do. We
can keep throwing people in against the tougher teams and
outlast them as a result."
The squad will take on Delaware Valley College this
Saturday at 12 p.m.

"Beach" Volleyball
Maybe Parrish Beach doesn't get its nickname from the fact that it's the best
place to kick back and get some sun at Swarthmore. The prominent campus
locale has become a popular place for Swat volleyball enthusiasts, including
sophomores Xan Fishman and Eugene Palatulan to gather and play pick-up
games in the long shadow of the Clothier Bell Tower.

"It's just us playing the game we love on the beach for fun," Palatulan said.

Thirty years after its passage, Title IX
remains problematic, controversial
BY RACHEL BURSTEIN
rburstel@swarthmore.edu
Even multimillionaire tennis superstars can be caught
unawares. Such was the case two weeks ago, when Jennifer
Capriati caused a mini-tremor in the world of gender-equity advocates by admitting, in response to a reporter's question, that she had "no idea" what Title IX was.
The tennis star may have raised a few eyebrows by
failing to acknowledge a piece of legislation that has
transformed the landscape of women's sports, but,
according to Tara Crean, her ignorance is hardly surprising. Crean litigated cases related to non-compliance with
Title IX statutes while a lawyer at the Women's Law

Project in Philadelphia.
"Now it seems to be taken for granted that girls are
participants in sports, and not just in sports that were
traditionally open to them," she said.

U.S. Department of Education data corroborates
Crean's assertion, demonstrating that the number of
female intercollegiate athletes has quadrupled since 1971,
the year before Title IX was passed as part of the Education
Amendments of 1972. The percentage of college athletes
who were women rose from 15 in 1972 to 37 in 1995.
But the question that caused Capriati's news conference debacle still remains: what should be done with Title
IX today? Although the impact of the statute is quantifiable, the legislation itself and the controversy that surrounds it are harder to untangle.
Far-Flung Scope

Confusion surrounding Title IX typically centers on
its scope and means of enforcement. Title IX's reach is
wide. It requires that "No person shall
on the basis of
sex, be excluded from participation in, or denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial
assistance." Harleigh Leach, women's volleyball coach,
points out, "it never explicitly mentions athletics,"
though a 1975 statute did specify the legislation's relevancy for athletic scholarships.
It is precisely because Title IX is so sweeping that col...

leges, universities and governmental agencies have such
a hard time interpreting its requirements. Nancy Lough,
Assistant Professor of Women's Studies and Physical
Performance and Development at the University of New
Mexico, understands the law in ethical terms. "Gender
equity is, in fact, a moral compass," she explained.
Lough defines gender equity in athletics as "separate
but equal treatment for women and girls in sports."
"A gender-equitable program exists when the men's
sports program would be pleased to accept as its own the
overall participation, opportunities, and resources currently allocated to the women's sport program and vice
versa," she said. "So if the men's basketball team would
trade everything they get to the women's team, in
exchange for everything they get, then we have achieved
equity."
Equity, Not Equality
Robert Williams, athletic director at Swarthmore,
explains that the equity Lough describes should not be
confused with equality. Title IX requires that schools provide equitable opportunities for men and women in the
areas of athletic financial assistance, athletic interest,
and other aspects of athletic programming including
scheduling, equipment, travel allowances and medical
supervision. The law, however, does not require either
equal expenditures on men's and women's sports or a
one-to-one ratio of men's to women's teams.
Swarthmore, which currently has 10 varsity programs
for men and 11 for women, "budgets equally [for men and
women]," according to Williams. He adds, though, that
"the budget is based primarily on the program we're committed to."
Until two years ago, when the college cancelled the football program, athletic budgets at Swarthmore were skewed,
with men's teams accounting for 63 percent of recruiting
expenditures. Williams maintains, however, that the college always operated within the bounds of the law.
The leveling of expenditures in the wake of the football
cut does not mean that the team was cut in the interest of
gender equity, according to women's soccer coach Amy
Brunner. "The football cut was in no way connected with
Title IX," she said. "It had everything to do

IX" and that "the manner in which the Department
enforces the law needlessly results in the elimination of
certain men's teams."
These opponents of Title IX are not the only ones calling for change. For the law's supporters, the issue of
enforcement is frustrating. Lough explains that, since the
federal government has never withdrawn funding from
an institution in response to a Title IX violation, lawsuits
are the only recourse for gender equity advocates.
"As it exists today, it's a lot like driving on the highway," Lough said. "The speed limit is posted, and it's the
law. However, few people drive the designated speed or
the
comply with the law. Only when a real threat exists
do most people drive
potential for a speeding ticket
within the speed limit. Since the Office for Civil Rights
has never imposed the actual penalty for noncompliance,
the motivation to comply has been miniscule."
But despite this problem, few would dispute Title IX's
impact. According to a longitudinal study conducted by
the National Association for Girls and Women in Sport,
the average number of women's teams per school is at an
all-time high of 8.34, up from a little over 2 in 1978. More
than 100,000 women participated in intercollegiate athletics in 200
L
But Jennifer Capriati's unfamiliarity with Title IX
may demonstrate its impact best of all. Title IX, four
years older than Capriati herself, has had such widereaching impact in the world of women's sports that its
effects are often taken for granted.

recruiting efforts, opponents, including President George

In order to remain in compliance with Title IX,
Williams says that the school has had to increase participation among women, who make up a smaller percentage
of student athletes than of the general college population.
"To encourage participation, we've developed a junior
varsity level of play, so that it sometimes looks like we
have more money allocated for women, he said."

Garnet Tide's 3-1 start best since 1993
Players credit new head
coach Eric Wagner for the
squad's early success
BY JIM DALTON

jdaltonl@swarthmore.edu
After easily sinking its last three opponents, the last
two by decisive shutouts, the men's soccer team has
surged to a 3-1 record. Flooded with confidence, swelled
with a mix of talent and experience, and anchored by a
technical and demanding coach, the team is looking forward to upcoming games against some of the best teams in

the Centennial Conference.

Last Wednesday, September 4, the Garnet blanked the
Griffins of Gwynedd-Mercy College 1-0. Although the Tide
struggled to score, they demonstrated that they could win
the game on ball possession, clearly controlling the tempo
throughout. Defender Steyen Pater 'O5 posted the gamewinner in the 48th minute of play, and keeper Nate Shupe
'O5 recorded his first shutout of the season.
"We all carried a great deal of confidence following our
convincing 'mud-bowl' victory against Medgar Evers,"
Shupe said. "This confidence played a key role in our victory against Gwynedd-Mercy. Although the final score
indicated a close match, we dominated much of the play."
Shupe praised his defense for their ability to keep the
Griffins in check. "Certainly the credit for the shutout
should go primarily to the defense, which played nearly
flawlessly, only allowing five shots to come my way during
the entire match," he said.
In its game against Valley Forge Christian College this
past Saturday, Sept. 7, the team shut out its second straight
opponent, winning 3-0. The Tide dominated the game from
the beginning, applying constant pressure on their opponent. The midfielders were able to control the center of the
field for the entire match, frustrating Valley Forge, as the

defense kept scoring opportunities limited.
Forward Charlie Taylor 'O6 continued his superb offensive play, tallying a goal and an assist to pace the Tide.
Pater came away with his second goal in as many games,
scoring with a header off of a Taylor feed to give the
Garnet the early 1-0 advantage. In the 24th minute, Taylor
scored his third goal of the season on a 25-yard blast to
extend the Garnet lead to 2-0. The first-year forward made
the shot seem effortless in his recap. "It was a goal outside
the box. I looked up and just hit my shot," he said.
Taylor attributes his success to the "guys on the team,
especially the upperclassmen, for giving me confidence
out on the field." Defender Alex Elkins 'O6 notched his
first career goal in the 55th minute of play on a free kick

from 25 yards out to conclude the Garnet scoring.
Keeper Reuben Heyman-Kantor 'O6, in his first game in
the net, recorded his first shutout. "Going into the game I
was just trying to concentrate on myself, doing the things
I needed to do to be ready," he said. "I've obviously played
a lot of games before, so I tried to tell myself that this game
would be no different. The way I always try to look at it is,
regardless of the level of competition, the things I'm capable of doing on the field don't change. I can only play as
good as I am, so I tried to go out on the field just trying to
play within myself."
As Shupe had done after his performance against
Gwynedd-Mercy, Heyman-Kantor also credited the defense

for the shutout. "My role in this one was mainly trying to
the defense on the same page, helping Cam

[MacDearmid 'o3] and Alex [Elkins 'o6] keep things
organized," he said. "They, along with John Tuthill
['o6] and Kirk [Ellison 'os], made my job easy."
The Tide possess a balanced attack, thanks to the
revamped structure installed by new head coach Eric
Wagner, whom the players immediately point to
when asked who's responsible for the team's early
success. "Coach Wagner has pushed us all to the limits of our physical and mental ability," Shupe said.
"Preseason was much more rigorous than in years
past, and the fitness and tactical awareness we forged
in those two weeks have been evidently shown in our
defensive play, which has thus far been the backbone
of our success," he added. "In previous seasons, early
goals against and numerous break-away opportunities have severely restricted our success."

The new system has garnered immediate success
and has the Tide looking forward to confronting some
of the best NCAA Division 111 teams this year.
Forward Charlie Taylor explained the team's yearning for the big games ahead.
"We're all looking forward to the [Johns] Hopkins
game," he said. "Then there's Richard Stockton,
ranked No. 1 in NCAA Division 111 men's soccer, who
we're also looking forward to playing. These games
are going to be a real test in character and how far
we've come as a team."
The Garnet Tide have plenty of reason to be excited.
Their 3-1 record is the team's best since the 1993 season.
Shupe summed up the team's optimism: "We are all very
excited about the season ahead, and hope to surprise a few

teams along the way."
