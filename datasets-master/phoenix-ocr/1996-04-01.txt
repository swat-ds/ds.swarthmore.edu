Four Students to Become Elected, Voting Members of Board of Managers
Ms./Mr. Swat Competition,
Lollipops, and Revolution
Among Student Proposals

Four

The

Board of Managers has decided to
allow students to elect four of their
peers to serve as members, President
Al Bloom said Friday. The Board hopes that
this measure will make Swarthmore better
able to live up to its commitment to liberty,
democracy, and the pursuit of more impres-

sive resumes, he explained.
Neil Austrian, Chairman of the Board,
added that students will provide diversity,
fresh perspectives, and people willing to make
coffee. As Commissioner of the National
Football League, he also looks forward to
using his newfound student connections to
recruit more rigorously.
Other Board members, however, regard
the student representatives' fresh perspectives with a certain amount of hesitation.
Binky Zambuza '97 hopes to institute a Ms./
Mr. Swattie competition, a plan wholeheartedly supported by Sexism Advisor Phyllis
Schlafly.

Among the criteria for determining finalists: the ability to sing out of tune but feel
validated about it, an insatiable desire for
Sharpies potato cheese soup, and a copious
supply of righteous indignation. Zambuza
has encountered some opposition to this plan
since it has been uncovered that he intended
to monopolize both titles for himself. "Gender boundaries are so, like, socially constructed, right? So why not?" Zambuza commented.
Lolita Smith '46 (that's 2046, not 1946)
has more long-term plans in mind: "Like, I
want to start a revolution, or something like
that, you know? I think that we're all too

Swat Airport Opens Amid Diversity
Controversy and Student Protest

a move that stunned the campus, the
nation, and the Federal Aviation Administration, President Al Bloom yesterday
announced the opening of the Swarthmore
International Airport for Small Aircraft.
The first aircraft, a Cessna Skyhawk piloted by Chuck Yeager, landed at 11 p.m. on
the sidewalk between Kohlberg Hall and the
Lang Performing Arts Center.
The decision to allow aircraft landings on
what was once a busy walkway took many
students by surprise.
"I was walking peacefully to Du Pont for

zoomed down out of
the sky and landed not

bureacracy. "If an institution receives Federal funding—and S warthmore does—itmay
not be permitted to engage in certain activi-

ties, such as the provision ofair departure and
arrival services."
Bloom said he hopes the airport isn't illegal, but feels certain he can "get the FAA off
the College's back" simply by denying the
airport exists. "It worked when they complained about underage drinking," he said.
Bloom added that he hopes the community
will support his struggle with the government. In tue long run, he claimed, the airport
will prove a financial boon to the College.

will be outraged over this atrocity?"
Kuperberg, assisted by an Economics 21
study group run amok, offered to present
Bloom with an economic analysis of why the
airport represented a clear-cut case ofmarket
failure. Bloom said he wasn't interested.
"Those economists are clueless," he said.
"If they only spoke 76 different Asian languages, like I do, then they'd understand why
this airport is the best idea since sliced bread."
In a sign that Bloom may be losing his
political touch, members of the community
took issue with even this last statement.
"I know of at least two better ideas that
have come along in the past," said Engineering professor Truck Neverbrahms. "One, the

win the second round of mas
cot balloting in an overwhelming
landslide, an anonymous source in theAlumni
Office said yesterday.
"Art Glass" has received 13,186 mail-in
votes from alumni and parents, while the
official choices—"Little Quakers" and "Garnet Foxes"—have together collected just489
votes. Only 16 ballots were cast for "No
Mascot."
The source said the Alumni Office would
still distribute ballots to all students, faculty
and staff today, even though their votes cannot possibly make a difference in the election. "We want everyone to feel they had a
real role in the process," the source said.
Harry Gotwals, vice-president for alumni,
development and public relations, denied the
ballots had even been counted. "We have no
idea who won," he said. "And frankly, I can't
imagine why anyone would vote for 'Art
Glass.' I mean, I'm paid to say nice things
about the school, but even I can't find anything nice to say about that ugly pastel stuff.
What was the architect thinking?"
The Alumni Office source said no one
should believe a word Gotwals says: "Would
you pay any attention to a man who wears a
bowtie every single day of the year?"
Student leaders said the alumni balloting
results only served to demonstrate the need
for more student input in Swarthmore's decision-making processes.
"This is ridiculous," said Student Council
member Cy Lant. It just goes to show that Al
Bloom and the Board of Managers don't care
what students think. They were probably
meeting behind closed doors, or something
like that. Can we hold a silent sit-in?"
Council ordered The Phoenix not to divulge the time and location of the sit-in.
Because SC has the absolute right to censor
this newspaper at any time and in any way,
there wasn't a whole lot we could do.
College officials said that ifthey found out
where the sit-in would be held, they woulddo
their utmost to prevent it.
"All they'll have to do is offer everyone a
lollipop, said Bon Quisha '99, a newly-elected
student member of the Board of Managers.
"Lollipops are great. They should be part of
the dominantparadigm. We shouldreify them
and have discourses about them and investigate the social origins of the lollipop concept—as well as its different manifestations
in non-Western cultural contexts."

Please, shut us down!
Maintaining a campus newspaper takes a lot of time, and a lot of money.
Thousands of dollars every year go into the budget for The Phoenix, and
dozens of students stay up through the night staring at computer screens
and grumbling at their co-editors.
We at The Phoenix feel that this is a problem; we demand that the
College abolish us immediately.
One of the main problems with The Phoenix is that it leads us to take
ourselves too seriously. We wrangle ceaselessly over attaining high
journalistic standards, we agonize over whether we might be offending
anyone, we spend time pontificating about Our Lofty Call To Serve This
Fine Campus.
Quite frankly, this is never going to change. As long as this thing is
staffed by Swatties, it'll be one big neurosis that fills the recycling bins
every Friday.
Put us out of our misery, now. We're begging you.
With all of that extra money, the College can do lots of nifty things. It
can fund about a tenth of another conservative speaker, say, which will
make the Young America's Foundation happy. It can pour a lot of money
into SAC so that we have lots more Paces parties that no one can tell apart.
We could even bring Dave Mathews back to campus for an encore
performance! In this spirit, we present to you...

Top Ten Better Uses for The Phoenix Budget
10. Useless sundials on every building, not justKohlberg
9. Make Small Craft Warnings 350 pages long
8. More airport runway lights
7. Monthly all-campus trip to Acapulco
6. Create the Ewart Yearwood Fellowship: one lucky
student gets to spend three and a half years somewhere else
(first recipient: Al Bloom)
5. Filet mignon and truffles for study breaks
4. Every window, every dorm room: art glass
3. Provide for a new philosophy course: The Ontology of
Slide Rock
2. A special Play Pranks On Haverford fund
1. Erect a 40-foot statue of Michel Foucault

Real Wood Pencils Have Really Sharp Points

FEISTY?

Someone

As

a freshman, I used a me
chanical pencil, which really
annoyed my roommates. It
kept snapping off, and then I had to
press that clicker thing to get more
lead, which really annoyed my roommates. And whenever I did my orgo
homework, I ran out of eraser, which
really annoyed my roommates.
So I' ve finally seen the light, which,
to no one's surprise, really annoyed
my roommates. At a dawn Pencil
Prayer Service led by the S warthmore
Writing Implement Association, a
revelation came to me. I had a vision,
and I peed my pants. This last incident really annoyed my roommates.
But, to get to my main point here, I
realized that mechanical pencils do
not have good points. This is because
you can't sharpen them. If you try to
sharpen a mechanical pencil, you get
lots of shreds ofcolored plastic. This
is a sin. Someone died for it 2000
years ago. And if you sharpen your
pencil in lab, sparks may fly from the
metal parts, setting the lab ablaze. I
know. I did this. It really annoyed my
roommates.

So you may ask, how do I do homework with a pen? I don't. Pens are
bad. But wood. Wood is the way to
go. Gimme a good Dixon
Ticonderoga and it'll beat your Bic,
or even Larry Westphal's Lamy.

Why is this? Because a wood pencil is the only writing implement on
Earth that can be sharpened in a pencil sharpener. When you sharpen it, it
gets very pointy. It has a point. Lest
you have trouble understanding this,
I will repeat myself: wood pencils
have sharp points when you sharpen
them. For some reason, this fact really annoys my roommates.
There's another reason wood is
good: the shavings from the pencil
sharpeners look just a wee bit like
marijuana. So if you want to get rich,
and you use wood pencils, you need
only invest in zip-lock bags. The
wealth will follow. A wood pencil
userfromBerkeley, Californiafunded
his entire college education this way.
But it really annoyed his roommates.
By the way, I think the counterpoint is dumb. Its author smokes pot,
or at least thinks he does. Believe me.
I know. It annoys my roommates.
Speaking of which, I need new
roommates. The wealth generated by
using real pencils can only help so
much. For one thing, it can't buy me
a high number in the housing lottery
(at least that's what the Dean's Office says). So if I want to escape my
roommates, I'll have to get together
with someone else. Preferably someone with a high number. Got one?
Then pick a room with me. I'll pay
you back in, oh, wood pencil shavings.

Why Squirrels Need

Safe Spaces on Campus

Someone Else

Down

with International Rela
tions! Long live Squirrel
Studies! Ah, ifonly this were
the reality at Swat!
The other day I saw a squirrel outside my window. It was way up in a
tree, with its tail curled up, squealing
at the top of its lungs. Does this sound
like a happy Swattie to you? If the
College had created an appropriate
safe space, would that squirrel a) be
violating my privacy in such a shameless manner or b) feel the need to
express his discontent in such a
disempowering way? Squirrels have
had no choice but to congregate in
Wharton lounges, and it is not right
for them to have to share their safe
space with ruggers!
You might be thinking, "The nerve
of this writer to try to co-opt the voice
of those who are already voiceless."
Although it is admittedly difficult for
me to transcend my own hegemonic
cultural framework, I think it is imperative that we face up to our
speciesist reality. Those new trash
cans are prejudiced against squirrels.
How would you feel if the only entrance to Sharpies was about six
inches high and obstructed by black
metal bars? A culture whichdissuades
students from propping open doors
prevents squirrels from being able to
visit their human friends without un-

dergoing the embarrassing faux-pas
of having to climb in through their
windows.
Such blatant disregard of squirrel
rights is even more inexcusable given
the College's shamefulappropriation
of cultural icons from the squirrel
community. If you have checked out
our home page lately, you will notice
the use of leaf imagery. Were the
squirrels consultedabout this? I don't
think so. Who needs students on the
Board of Managers when you don't
have SQUIRRELS serving as well?
How would we feel if squirrels started
installing art glass and coffee bars in
tree trunks?
I dream of the day when we will
finally have Acorn Bar at Sharpies.
When Squirrel Awareness Week becomes a reality...with tables next to
oak trees, not Parrish Parlors! Ulti-

mately squirrels must be given the
tools to empower themselves. But
the College must make the first step,
because by incorporating squirrel
culture, we can only enrich our own.
Think of how much better the Safer
Sex video could be if it took squirrel
mating rituals into account?
You probably aren't ready to take
me seriously. Well, no matter what
you say or do either to me or my little
furry friends, we are all still worthwhile people...oh my goodness, even
my self-esteem booster is speciesist.
Doesn't the injustice ever end?

Applause for the Editors
No longer willingly accepting arbitrary patriarchal decision-making
To the editor:
The devices of patriarchy and institutionalized oppression are many
and varied, but it wasn't until recently that I realized just how insidiously Swarthmore seeks to control
our minds. Whilst perambulating
around campus, I overheard someone referring to having "a class in
DuPont," which naturally set off my
internal alarms.
Why must we refer to it as
"DuPont?" Why accept this arbitrary
label as absolute? Why should only
one mode of expression be legitimized and others set aside as inferior? If I choose to refer to the building which might be said to house our
chemistry, biology, and physics departments as "Fred", what right has
Swarthmore to declare that I am
wrong and misguided? I decline to
endorse the accomplishments of a
dead white male every time I wish to
refer to the structure on the north end
of our campus.
Furthermore, why must we have
"classes?" Doesn't the term imply an
authority figure imparting infallible
knowledge to unwilling listeners?
How can we invoke the name of Fou-

cault and simultaneously continue to
support this testament to inequality?
I propose that we rename these encounters "interactions," a term suitably embodying the potential for
learning by everyone involved. That
would allow us both to liberate students from the obligation of listening
to professors, certainly a positive step,
and to start charging those professors
tuition fees for the education they
gain by attending their own class

interactions.
There remains a problem, though.
By merely having on hand figures
who seem, by dint of age and duration of educational experience, to
wield epistemological authority, we
marginalize the input of countless
others who deserve just as much recognition. I therefore suggest that we
abolish the institution of faculty and
make our interactions free-form, unburdened by such things as syllabi
(who is that ex-professor to decide
that these particular authors embody
the entirety of knowledge about a
given subject?) and assignments (I
have never yet encountered a classassigned paper that truly expressed
my deepest yearnings). Discussions

would draw entirely on personal experience and such source material as
anyone might happen to have read.
Then again, since I also recommend abolishing specific meeting
times as inhibitory and repressive,
the likelihood of these discussions
ever actually happening is not especially high. But if they did, darn it,
they'd be mighty meaningful.
Achieving progress in education is
not a simple task: if we continue to
adhere to the old ways, to a linear
construction of development and expansion, we will inevitably prop up
outmodeddiscourses of success, failure, improvement and the like. Rather,
we need to acknowledge the new
direction of the postmodern educational institution: to go forward, we
must stop striving to go forward and
start going in circles. Paradoxical and
all, but that's contemporary theory
for you. Perhaps truly being progressive lies in accomplishing less rather
than more.
Or perhaps not. I certainly wouldn't
want to imply that my personal view
is right or anything.

to read swat.talk discussions in which

In 1921, Swarthmore had yet to
acquire its reputation as an academic
powerhouse. What reputation the
school had was as a tennis power.
The Men's team had been national
champions in 1910, 1913, 1915,
1916, 1919, and 1920. Although national championships were not held
during World War I, Swarthmore
nonetheless won conference titles in
each of these years. Women's national championships had not yet
been organized, but the Swarthmore
women's team had been tri-college
champions since 1910.

Parrish in those years, but in September of 1922, Samuel Tarble wrote to
the Board of Managers, "Surely the
home of the national champions can
provide its teams with better facilities for their improvement? I myself
am willing to pledge $4,000 toward
the construction of new courts, and a
building for their equipment at the
foot of the hill on which the Main
Building sits. I little doubt that there
are other friends of the College willing to do the same." Within three
months, similarpledges were received
from Joseph Palmer and Philip Martin, and in the spring of 1922, the
"Tarble Tennis Building" was
erected.
At its opening, Tarble contained
equipment rooms on the ground floor,
a trophy room and team lounge on the
second floor, and coaches' offices on
the third floor. The building was surrounded by Tennis courts on its north,
east and south sides, but the west side

of the building was built without windows so that it might be used as a
practice wall. The Phoenix recorded
the words spoken by William Alden,
Head of the Mens' Athletics Department, at the ribbon-cutting ceremony:
"It is my hope," he said, "that this
building will be host to champions
both in the classroom and on the
tennis courts for generations to come."
However, during the second world
war, the building was taken over by
the Navy as an administration building for the Naval v-12 unit stationed
at Swarthmore. The expanse of tennis courts was used as a parade ground
for the v-12 unit and, in the spring of
1943, for the Chinese Naval Officers
stationed at Swarthmore.
At the war's end, Old Tarble was
used as overflow housing for the flood
of veterans returning to complete their
interrupted college careers. The building did not return to the Athletic
Department until 1949, when Mary
Lyon was purchased by the college.

Swarthmore's national dominance
in tennis also came to a close with the
coming of the war, and the tennis
team trophy room and lounge were
replaced with Mens' Athletics Department Offices in the early fifties.
A few of the northernmost tennis
courts were demolished to make way
for Worth Health Center in 1966,and
the offices in Tarble were reorganized when the mens' athletic department and the women's athletic department combined in 1969.
Averil Phoul's History of
Swarthmore states that by 1981, the
original Tarble tennis courts had become dilapidated, and Mertz Dorm
was planned for a site just north of
Tarble. With the erection of Tarble
Pavilion next to the fieldhouse in
1983, the athletic department moved
out of their Old Tarble offices. The
remaining Tarble tennis courts were
demolished in 1985 because they had
become a safety hazard to the Ultimate Frisbee players of MertzLawn.
