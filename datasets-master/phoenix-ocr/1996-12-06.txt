Coordinators Decide to
End Pub Night Indefinitely
Incident involving drunken
prospective basketball
player sealed the decision

Drunken junior
urinates on door of
Willets RA's room

Bi Josh Kramer

Toki Rehder

A male Swarthmore junior urinated
on the door of a female Willets Resident Assistant (RA) at about 4:00 a.m.
on Saturday,
November 23.
Swarthmore Borough police arrested
the student and detained him in the
Delaware County Prison until later on
Saturday morning.
When the RA confrontedthe student
at her door, she promptly called Public
Safety. The male student offered the
RA money not to report the incident.
While the RA attempted to call Public
Safety, the male student verbally assaulted her and tried to physically prevent her from making the phone call,
according to the November 29 issue of
The Swarthmorean.
Public Safety detained the student
while he was attempting to leave the
scene. With the consent of the RA,
Public Safety then called the
Swarthmore Borough police.
Officer J.R. Wesley responded to
the call. Upon arrival, Wesley spoke to
a student who had "observed a man in
the doorway urinating on the floor,"
according to Swarthmore Borough
Police Chief Donald Lee.
The police questioned the student,
who again tried to leave. They then
arrested him on eight charges: institutional vandalism, open lewdness,
simple assault, harassment, terroristic
threats, underage drinking, public
drunkenness, and disorderly conduct.
The student was taken to the magistrate and, according to Lee, he was
"held overnight in theDelaware County
Prison because he could notmake bail."
He was bailed out on Saturday morning.
Charges against the student have
beenfiled withthe magistrate. According to Owen Redgrave, director ofPublic Safety, the defendant has had a
preliminary arraignment. The preliminary hearing was originally scheduled
for Monday, December 2, but has been
rescheduled for early February.
In the meantime, the College has
begun the adjudication process. All
involved parties as well as the administration declined to comment.
The incident was related to an earlier
occurrence on the night of Thursday,
November 21, when another male
Swarthmore junior urinated on the same
door. No formal action has been taken
against this student beyond a complaint filed by the RA.

Pub Nite coordinatorshaveended the popular Thursday night event for an indefinite
period of time, seemingly in direct response
to a recent incident regarding an inebriated
prospective student.
This action does not signal a change in the
College's alcohol policy, nor was it, according to Associate Dean Tedd Goundie, at the
behest of the administration.
Goundie stated that Pub Night was closed
by its organizers after what he called "an
increase in vandalismand reports of drunken
behavior on Thursday nights this semester."
Additionally, Goundie stated that he did "not
expect to see a major, seemingly institutional
or traditional, party that occurs every Thursday" in the weeks to come, though the administration has not prohibited such an event.
Dana Correale '97, one of the organizers of
Pub Night, also stated that the decision to end
Pub Night was made by her and the other
organizers of the event. When asked about
what communications she had withtheDean's
Office, Correale mentioned a meeting with
Goundie, stating that "[Goundie] said at this
meeting 'You're not having Pub Night any
more?' and we said, no, we are not...we
were planning on ending Pub Night after this
semester, and this was a good opportunity to
do so.'"
The measure was prompted by an incident
on Thursday, November 21, when a prospective student visiting here from New Jersey
became highly inebriated, and was cited for
underage drinking by Swarthmore Borough
Police.
The prospective student was visiting
Swarthmore with a specific focus on the
basketball program. He was given a host,

basketball coach. Mack had "a great deal of
work" that night, so he asked the prospective
student what he would like to do. According
to Mack, the prospective student replied that
he would "like to go socialize."
According to Mack, the prospective student, along with two other prospective students whom he had met, then went to Phi Psi
fraternity at 10:00 p.m., where there was a
private social gathering. Phi Psi member John
Delatush '97, however, states that the prospective students only came to Phi Psi at
around 11:30 p.m. or so, and that they were
immediately asked to leave the membersonly event by Phi Psi president Aaron Bond
'97.
When the prospective student returned to
Mack's room in Dana, he was obviously
inebriated. Mack stated the two other prospective students who were accompanying
the now drunken student reported that the
individual hadbecome inebriated at Pub Nite.
However, Jen Philpott '97, both the PA and
the host of this particular Pub Night, disagrees.
Philpott believes that, according to discussions she had with each of the night's servers,
the prospective students had "from 2 to 3
beers each" and she explained, "to the best of
my knowledge, there was no reason to suspect that[the prospective student] was a drunk
person [when he left]." Philpott said that she
"regrets the fact that when the [prospective
students] came in...1 did not tell the servers
not to serve them."
The prospective student was not obviously
drunkwhen he arrived at Phi Psi after the end
of Pub Nite, according to Delatush.
Initially, Mack decided that the best course
ofaction for the student, who reported being
tired, was to sleep under supervision. The
prospective student was able to sleep for an
hour, but woke up afterwards, and defecated
on the floor of Mack's room.

call Worth Health Center, but they were un-

Alums Charge College is Teaching Pornography
Visiting professor, students,
defend decision to study
graphic AIDS text
By

Jessica Harbour

A somewhat belated controversy has
erupted over the use of the book Memories
That Smell Like Gasoline, by the late author
David Wojnarowicz, in the introductory English course "The Bodies That Surround Us"
during fall semester 1995. A pair ofalumni
Matt Schenk '95 and James Taylor '72 of the
Young America's Foundation—have charged
that the book is obscene and not appropriate
for use in a college classroom.
Lisa Cohen, visiting professor of English
literature, used the text as part of a unit on
writings about AIDS. "The question of selfrepresentation," she explained, "has been a
key aspect of responses to this epidemic... It
—

was important to include the work of someone who had himself lived with and died of
AIDS." (Wojnarowicz died of AIDS-related
complications in 1993.) Some of the other
texts studied in the course, English 3, included Shakespeare's Measure for Measure,
Kafka's The Metamorphosis, selections from
Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, poetry by Wallace Stevens, and A Small Place
by Jamaica Kincaid.
Since the course examined representations
of the body in literature, Cohen thought the
book appropriate; "Wojnarowicz saw part of
his task as articulating the many and often
obscured relationships between our political
culture and the fate of an individual's body,"
she explained. The book, published in 1992
by Artspace Books, details Wojnarowicz's
years as a child prostitute in New York City
and his reactions to friends' deaths from
AIDS. It includes drawings of nude men
performing sex acts on each other and often
uses graphic language.

Some students in the class thought the
book appropriate to use. Elijah Porter '99
called it "well-written, and a thoughtful
piece...l thought there was a lot to learn from
the way the book is presented." Another
student, Jenny Briggs '99, ended up writing a
paper on Memories. "I disagree withall of the
negative comments," she said. "I thought it
was really disturbing and depressing, yes, but
very powerful."
On the other hand, Hyorim Lee '99 refused
to read the entire book, calling it "interesting,
but offensive." She added, "The story itself
had a lot to say.. .so we actually had a good
discussion, but for a PDC class, I don'tknow."
She said at least one other student refused to
look at the pictures, covering them and concentrating on the text.
Allison Marsh '9B also felt the book was
offensive. "I found that the book lacked any
redeeming quality," she said. "It was very
poorly written, in the manner of a young
child. It relied upon a shock method: graphic

pictures, large type, to convey its message."
She also said she was "not impressed by the
class overall" and that "there were several
books that I found unworthy of a college
curriculum." She decided to show Memories
to Schenk, with whom she was already acquainted, because she feltuncomfortableprotesting the bcok's use herself: "It was easier
to do it with him as my representative" because "it was my grade, and...[l feared] I
would immediately be lambasted for being
against the issues presented." She also said
she intended Schenk to bring the problem up
with Cohen or with the English Department.
Schenk and Taylor, however, thought stronger measures should be taken. "I just sort of
found it troubling that this book was being
held up as an introduction to the English
Department as a whole," said Schenk. "A
student looking at the course catalog wouldn't
know that [he or she] would be subjected to

Ceiling of ML Room Caves In, Workbox Short Staffed
Plaster falls on student's
bed while student leaves
voice mail with workbox
By Sylvia

Weedman

At midnight on November 7, after a sixinch by four-inch piece of the sheetrock ceiling in her Mary Lyon (ML) dorm room had
just come crashing to the floor, Rachel
Henighan '97 got up from her reading to call
the maintenance staff. She had been in touch
with "workbox" two weeks before about a
small but growing crack in her ceiling, but the
problem had never been as serious as it was
on this particular evening.
Receiving no answer on the phone,
Henighan commenced explaining the incident on workbox's voice mail, and "just as I
said 'fell,'" she explained, "another two foot
square part of the ceiling fell, half on the bed
and half on the floor," exactly where she had
been reading. A maintenance crew responded
to her dramatic message first thing the next
morning, ripping down the rest of the damaged area and tacking up a makeshift covering which will remain until permanent repairs can be done.
According to Ralph Thayer, director of
maintenance for the College, Mary Lyon is
one of the most troublesome buildings on
campus. Ofall the dormitories, ML and Worth
have seen the least renovation in recent years.
This time ofyear, complaints regarding heat-

ing and plumbing are at their peak.
To make matters worse, one of the
two maintenance workers assigned
to the ML zone has been on extended
leave recently due to illness, and the
other workers, according to Thayer,
have had to "make do" in his absence.
Henighan had been in touch with
workbox before, once e-mailing that
her ceiling was leaking water, then emailing again to explain that the leak
seemed to have stopped. When the
nine-inch crack above her bed began
dripping water again, she e-mailed
them a third time and left voice messages as well. At this point, Henighan
said, the remote prospect of"the ceiling falling was peripheral to themain
problem of the ceiling dripping."
Needless to say, she had not considered that anything more threatening
than a few drops ofwater might erupt
over her bed, until it did.
When something goes awry in
campus rooms or offices like it did in
Henighan's, and the occupant calls
workbox, his or her message is received by John Tull, the work order
coordinator. He then ranks the reported problems in order of their immediacy (which is
why workers came to Henighan's door bright
and early the morning after her mishap). The
most pressing problems are those which affect the safety or health of the room's occupants. Problems that are more routine are

New Recycling Program Deemed Okay

News Briefs
Board ofManagers Appoints New Chair
J. Lawrence Shane has been appointed chair of the College'sBoard
of Managers,replacing Neil Austrian, who has chaired the board since
1989. Shane, aretiredexecutive of the Scott Paper Company currently
lives in Swarthmore. He joined the board in 1970. Since 1987,he has
been vice chair, and he has also chaired the Finance and Trusts
Administration Committee for the past ten years.
Shane is also a member of the College Planning Committee, and the
Board's Investment Committee. After graduating from Swarthmore
in 1956, Shane received an MBA from the Wharton School of
Business at the University of Pennsylvania in 1960.
Austrian, who graduated from Swarthmore in 1961, is president of
the National Football League.
Marge Scheuer, Class of 1948, will be replacing Shane as vice chair.

Swat Early Decision Applicants Increase
The early decision applicant pool at Swarthmore has increased by
19 percent from last year, The New YorkTimesreported last week. The
Admissions Office is currently in the process of evaluating early
applications; the notification date has been set for late next week.
Dean of Admissions Robin Mamlet could not be reached for
comment.

A total of 212 applications were received this year for the Fall Early
Decision Plan before the November 15 deadline. According to the
Times, the intended size of the class of 2001 is 365 students. Slightly
more than a quarter of the class of 2000 was accepted through the Fall
plan. Swarthmore traditionally has had a higher acceptance rate for
early decision than other colleges, and a much higher acceptance rate
for those who apply early than for those who apply with regular
decision.Last year approximately 60 percent of early applicants were
accepted, whereas only 34 percent of the entire applicant pool were
accepted.
A recent survey by the Times indicates that applying early is
becoming an increasingly popular option for college-bound high
school seniors. All but three of the colleges sampled reported an
increase in the number of early applicants from last year; over half
observed double-digit increases.

Retired Professor Writes WWII Memoir
Harry Pagliaro, professor emeritus of English literature, recently
published one of the only World War II memoirs written from the
perspective of a private. Up until this point, personal accounts of
World War II have mainly been written by officers.
The book, Naked Heart: A Soldier's Journey to the Front, is
published by the Thomas Jefferson University Press in Missouri.
As negative as the experience of war may seem, Pagliaro's memoirs
attempt to present a positive outlook by showing that his appreciation
oflife sharply increased. He does not deny, however, that "I would kill
or die before letting anybody force me to repeat it."

Despite several concerns over the
recycling program at
Swarthmore, including lack of student involvement, the program is running smoothly.
This is the inaugural year of the
current recycling program at
Swarthmore. Previously, recyclables
placed in bins in academic buildings
and dorms were takenby student "hall
representatives" to a location near
the building. Student recyclers, using
a truck owned by the College, would
pick up the recyclables and take them
to one of two central locations on
campus, where the recyclables were
sorted and placed into appropriate
bins.
With the current program, student
recycling workers assigned to each
dorm empty bins twice a week into
dumpsters near thedorms. From there,
Jack Clark Rubbage Removal recurrent

cycling workers are paid. This will
allow the College to recycle waste
more economically, according to
those involved in the program.
Chris Flood '99, a recycling coordinator, described the new system as
"more efficient because we don' t have
to sort materials; Jack Clark has to do
more work."
Jeff Jabco, director of grounds,
agreed with Flood's sentiment that
the current program is more efficient.
"The way we have it set up now, it's
better for the long term," said Jabco.
He also noted that the College is
currently adding recycling bins to
academic buildings the subject of an
all-campus e-mail sent on November

20.
In the e-mail he explained what
could and could not be put in the new
bins. He said, "It was just to let everyone know what was happening at the

The ambulance soon arrived, along

The Emergency MedicalTechnicians

of alcohol poisoning, and left him
without further incident.
The prospective student remained
on campus for the next evening,

the physical plant described the campus as a small city—indeed, including the main campus buildings, faculty houses, and other peripheral
College buildings, the maintenance
staff is in charge of 125 properties.
They receive approximately 40 work
orders per day from students, faculty,
and staff. At any one time, they are in
the process ofresponding to as many
as 640 work orders.
So when you discover that some-

thing is less thanperfect in your heater
or your shower or your lock, try to be
as specific as possible when you describe the problem to Tull. Most orders will be handled within 24 to 48
hours, but collapsing plaster and exploding fixtures will assuredly be
given preference over more minor
problems.
Thayer suggested that students,
faculty, and staffremember to "fully
describe the problem" in their e-mails
and voice messages, so the maintenance staff can better serve every one's
needs.

By

On Tuesday, December 3, nearly
50 students and a few administrators
attended an open meeting about how
to "defend, protect, and increase affirmative action on Swarthmore campus." The meeting was sponsored by
The Diversity Umbrella, SAO, SCLS,
College Democrats, and the Feminist
Majority.
The meeting was intended to build
a coalition of students that will take a
proactive role in promoting greater
diversity among faculty and students.
According to Vincent Jones '9B, president of College Democrats, the coalition is also "trying to fight any efforts to propagate anti-affirmative
action measures like California's
Proposition 209 in Pennsylvania."
Proposition 209, an initiative on the
California state ballot in November,
was also called the California Civil
Rights Initiative.

public entities.
The coalition has four main goals:
to urge the administration to take a
proactive stance on affirmative action, to make sure department recruiting and hiring procedures create
faculty diversity, to encourage student involvement in hiring committees, and to increase diversity in future classes admitted to Swarthmore.
Students also agreed that reforming the curriculum to include multicultural perspectives was an important goal. As facilitator Anne Potter
'99 stated, "We must get diversity on
the CEP agenda."
Although the Collegedoes not have
an affirmative action policy, Maurisa

people of color and by creating an
environment which is conducive to

force will work to "get people educated, committed, and active," Jones

same time."
Flood did note that although
the new program is more efficient, it does have several shortfalls. "More students got paid
more money for more work," he
said of the previous program.
"Also with the past program,
students were able to keep an
eye on the system and make sure
it was getting done."
Flood was also concerned with
the lack ofrecycling in academic
buildings as well as the lack of a
composting program, which existed in the previous program.
Under the old program, waste
food wouldbe taken from Sharpies each day to property owned
by the College.
Flood said, "If we could get
composting back and get more
bins in academic buildings, I
wouldn't have any problems
with the new system."

agreed: "It has no real value as
literature or as educational information... It's ridiculous to assign
this in a class at a school that costs
$29,000 a year and especially to
require it."
Instead of speaking to Cohen or
to the English Department, which
they believed would be a waste of
time, they mailed copies of the
book to all members of the Board
of Managers, as well as to several
news agencies across the country,
this past September.
"We have found to our regret
that the curriculum has become
obsessed withfocusing on extreme
views of sexual orientation, race,
and gender," read the letter to each
member of the Board. "Students
tell us that instructors...are also
obsessed withrace, feminism, and
homosexuality... There is virtually no way for a student to go
through four years at Swarthmore
without at some point having to
take an objectionable course."
The Board of Managers has apparently decided not to take any
further action in this case. "It is
very gratifying to know that there
is thatkind of strength and support
for academic freedom," commented Provost JennieKeith. "Not
every faculty has thatkind ofbacking and trust from their Board."
According to Schenk, three Board
members wrote the YAF to express their disinterest.
Taylor, meanwhile, was not surprised to hear of no action on the
Board's part: "I would suspect
those who think the book represents a problem.. .would go to the
president quietly." But it is unlikely that any action will be taken
publicly.
Dean Ngina Lythcott was unhappy with Schenk and Taylor's

decision to publicize the course as
required when it was not.
As a result of Taylor and
Schenk's mailings, editorial columns about the book's use have
appeared in The Washington
Times, The Delaware County
Daily Times, TheßichmondTimesDispatch, and The Chronicle of
Higher Education.
Most ofthe editorialsfound fault
with the book and its use.TimesDispatch columnist Robert Holland criticized the Board of Managers for deciding not to take action—"The trustees...engaged in
the usual blame-the-messenger
pomposity"—and called for "a
show of trustee fortitude in challenging the proliferation of garbage courses."
In response, Professor Craig
Williamson, chair of the English
Department, wrote, "The book is
considered an important text in
the academic and intellectual
worlds in which discussions of
AIDS, sexual choice, and representations of the body are carried
on.. .We are not in the business of
desensitizing any student to any
subject."
He also pointed out that "standards for obscenity vary...books
such as Madame Bovary and
Ulysses were once banned as offensive or obscene and have now
entered the canon as acclaimed
works of art."
Added Cohen, "When we discussed the book in class, everyone
present was given time to voice
their opinion; as always, everyone
was required to listen to and respect the widerange ofresponses
the book provoked.. .1 see my role
as giving students thetools to carefully and critically analyze a text,
rather than simply dismiss it because it produces discomfort or
embrace it because it is enjoyable."

A Political Obituary: Ross, We Hardly Knew You
By Wendy Lawrence

WRC deserves

official recognition.

One of the major goals of the Women's Resource Center in recent semesters
has been to make its presence more recognized on campus. This week, it has
succeeded: its voice has resonated all over campus.
Not only has the publicity for the upcoming elections for the open positions
on the WRC board been overwhelming, but current members of the board
made signs, did chalkings, tabled in Parrish, and held a well-attended open
meeting in the Women's Resource Center to discuss relevant issues. They
organized a variety of events for this weekand next including a poetry reading
by Nathalie Anderson, associate professor of English literature, and a holiday
potluck/open house for all women students, faculty and staff.
If the WRC board members wanted to prove that they can make themselves
heard on campus, they have succeeded. Indeed, it has been difficult to
overlook signs making students aware of the fact that the WRC does not
currently receive funding from the College as an official organ. It is likely to
take seven years before the possibility of such funding can even be officially

addressed.

Recently, the WRC has been on a virtual mission to become the equivalent

of the Black Cultural Center and the Intercultural Center. And in reality, why
shouldn't it? Women at Swarthmore may not be a minority, but that does not
mean that there is not sexism on campus, nor that all women feel safe on this
campus. We would like to commend their efforts and suggest that students
consider signing their petition demanding recognition from the College.

Bag lunches: use them or lose them.
Bag lunches are great. They're quick, they're convenient, and they're a
better deal than the minimal $3.00 lunch credit at Essie Mae's, especially once
you factor in the time wasted waiting in line.
Plus, it's one of those rare times when we can actually say that the
complaints students voiced were acknowledged. Students complained about
the lunchtime crunch on Tuesdays and Thursdays in Sharpies and so, lo and
behold, three-quarters ofthe way into the semester, we got our wish: lunch for
those of us perpetually on the run.
And they're really pretty good—a sandwich (either a vegetarian or a meat
option), a piece of fruit, cookies (sometimes even graham crackers), a bag of
chips, and juice. The best part of all is that you can walk in, pick one up, and
take it to class with you or wherever else you're headed.
Even Dining Services is not immune to the laws of supply and demand. If
students do not make use of this convenient new meal option, it is not likely
to be continued.So, if you approve of the new choices available to students,
make use of them! Get a box lunch!
We realize that there may be more important events occurring on campus
right now, but it's always nice to recognize the little things. Especially the
ones that make us happy.

A message from the good cop and the bad cop.
Erik and Mandara will cherish many fond memories of presiding over The
Phoenix this semester. We thank everyone who helped make it great (including the person who put the dead fish featured on this week's front page on the
lost and foundbulletin board). We hope that we have informed, intrigued, and
amused you and wish you the best ofluck with your final exams and papers.

A message from the publisher.
It's difficult to sum up in a few hundred words an experience that has so far

defined my life at Swarthmore.
I've worked on The Phoenix since my first week here; it's hard to believe
that next semester I won't be staying up all night every Thursday, I won't be
getting my hands covered with ink stuffing mailboxes on Friday afternoons,
I won't spend Sunday evenings at staff meetings.
The paper has changed a lot in two and a half years, and I like to think I
played some part in the changes. When I arrived at Swarthmore, readers didn't
believe anything that was printed in The Phoenix. It was hard to blame them,
too: the staff seemed not to care much about accuracy, thoroughness, or
balance.
As news editor, I announced—for the first time in the paper's history—a
rule that students would not be allowed to write news articles about organizations of which they were members. This simple guarantee, that readers
would get independent analysis of events instead of one-sided propaganda
pieces, astonished many members of the community. People didn't understand why I wouldn'tlet them write down their opinions, then print the results
as news stories.
That attitude seems to have changed: I can't remember the last time a club
protested because we insisted on assigning one of our staff writers to cover
the group's activities instead of letting the club's own officers write the article
themselves. And I think that by and large, our readers have come to expect
good, honest, fair reporting from us; fewer people complain that the paper is
full of nonsense, and more people seem to see the paper as a legitimate news
source.
Still, there is much room for improvement. I've noticed a disturbing
disparity between what people are willing to say to me in private, and what
they're willing to say on the record for publication in The Phoenix. It's not just
that people don't want the whole campus to find out about deeply personal
aspects of their lives. There appears to be a genuine fear of open, honest
debate: leaders in the faculty, administration and student body worry that the
average member of the community can't handle the full truth about even the
most innocuous College policies and the most innocent campus events.
As I leave The Phoenix to pursue other projects, I feel certain that this paper
is truly committed to good journalism—fairness and accuracy in news stories,
solid reasoning and meaningful debate in opinions pieces. I'd like to express
my hope that the community will reciprocate with a commitment to true
freedom of expression at Swarthmore.

An Open Letter to the College Community

ML, Worth in Dire
Need of Housing Help
We, the members of the Housing
Committee, would like to take this
opportunity to offer some suggestions on how the housing quality level
could be improved among various
Residence Halls.
Having seen what can be achieved
under the term 'renovation' in the
linpiessive PPR project of this summer, we have begun to think more
about which Residence Hall seems to
us most fitfor the next project of such

magnitude.
We also wanted to include a prioritized list of what we, as a representative community of various Residence
Halls, consider the most worthwhile
projects to undertake.
Our most urgent concern is the
upgrading of Mary Lyon Residence
Hall. While it might not need as extensive work as that which PPR received, we do have various suggestions for improvement of the living
conditions. They are as follows:
1. Testing for rotting of wood
2. Improving lighting in the main
lounge and hallways, especially the
basement
3. Fixing peeling plaster on ceilings and walls
4. Replacement of old furniture
with new
5. Possible creation of a public
computer space
We very much appreciate the work
currently being done on the basement
kitchen and would be even more grateful if these top four requests could be
attended to as soon as possible.
Our next most urgent concern is
the condition of Worth Residence
Hall, which seems to us worthy of a
project as large as that of PPR.
One suggestion we have as regards
this project is that its basic structure
and windows be left as intact and
authentic as possible. (A more extensive list of necessary repairs from
Worth Residents will follow).

In the Dana and Hallowell Residence Halls, replacement of the
plumbing and all toilets seems very
necessary considering the long-standing frequency of clogging and needed
repairs there.
Upgrading the laundry rooms in all
the Residence Halls is also important, i his would include adding more
washers and dryers, insuring that current equipment is efficiently maintained, providing ironing equipment
and a more cheerful environment.
Finally, filtering in of new furniture and the new wooden frame beds
or equally sturdy beds among all the
Residence Halls as well as new carpeting in Dana and Hallowell hallways and the women's bedrooms of
Mary Lyon Basement are additions
we feel would improve the quality of
living in these Residence Halls.
We hope that providing you with a
student perspective on priorities will
prove helpful as you appropriate funds
and develop long term plans for renovations.
We would also be interested in
seeing what type of schedule is generated for the upkeep and renovation
of the Residence Halls.
We really appreciate the vigourous
approach to current renovations and
thank you for your attention and consideration of these concerns.

so did the image of Ross Perot as a
viable option for the presidency.
It's as if the country decided the
fate of all third parties when it constructed the death of this man.
It took a successful, third-party
running mate who actually had a few
people scared in 1992, and turned
him into someone to ignore, someone
who didn't matter, because he wasn't
a Republican. Wasn't a Democrat.
He was just a really cool guy.
Seriousness aside, though, if the
third parties were going to hang their
hopes on one candidate, did it have to

be one so prone to jokes?
Americans will, I am sure, be sad
to see this man disappear from their
family-room televisions.
But all in all, I think we can agree
that he has gone to a better world.
A world without television, without book deals, without desperate
voters.

We are thankful for his brief presence among us, not only because of
its presence, but also because of its

brevity.
May he rest, and leave us all to live
in peace.

when I say that European-Americans
call the shots in our great country,
then just look in the nation's executive boardrooms or watch C-Span
every once and a while. I think you'll
agree with me then.
You may ask why have I decided to
let you in on this secret. Many ofyou
probably expect me to venture off
into some brilliant piece making
White people feel guilty for the wealth
and power they have accumulated
over the course of American history,
while others may be waiting for me to
extol the advancesBlack people have
made to do the same for themselves.
Well, I plan to do neither. Instead, I
intend to sound a call to action for
White America.
Contrary to popular belief, Black
America has not experienced particularly marked improvement economically or politically in the few
decades since the Civil Rights and
Black Power movements. In fact,
conditions for a great number of African-Americans have declined in the
last few decades as reflected by higher
numbers of unemployment, crime,
female-headed households, and poverty in the Black community. I could
spend days discussing the mechanisms responsible for this stark reality. However, I would rather discuss
solutions. I believe these problems
would no longer persist if White
America collectively decided to do
something about them today.
If you truly believe that structural
racism, discriminationand sexism are
wrong and should not exist in this
country, then do something about it.
Organize a bunch of your White
friends and use your power to break
down the system. Press your mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, distant
cousins, spouses and acquaintances
who happen to be members of Congress, presidents of corporations,
owners of local grocery stores, law
enforcement officials, or whatever to
pass and support legislation which
will rid the criminal justice system of
its racial biases or improve school
systems in Black communities, for
on example.
Raise the consciousness of your
compatriots who have yet to fully

comprehend the nature of the race
problem in America. This task will
not be simple given thatmany ofyour
friends will probably not believe that
race matters any longer. In fact, a
great deal of them, especially white
men, will resist your efforts to organize European-Americans because
they feel attacked or that they cannot
be blamed for the creation of a racist,
sexist, homophobic, classist society
which they perpetuate by accepting
the status quo and refusing to actively engage themselves in endeavors to make this country live up to its
creed of equality.
Some of you might say that it is the
responsibility of those most affected
by inequality to better their own situations. Well, the last time I checked,
Black people have come a long way
in this country largely due to their
own struggles. And I should add that
those efforts have been met with a
rather violent backlash from several
portions of White America. Isn't it
time for a change? Besides, the Federalist Papers, which heavily influenced the nature of our system of
government, say that the majority
must protect the rights of the minority in a majority-rule society. If the
majority does not defend and protect
the rights of the minority, then we
have tyranny of the majority. In this
instance, the minority need not abide
by the laws instituted by the government because it ignores their interests and denies their ability to participate equally. That means that even
you conservatives who love to talk
about preserving theConstitution and
the original intent of the founding
fathers can take part in this as well
(although I postulate that the racist
underpinnings of most conservative
political rhetoric will preclude this
particular outcome).
Now don't get me wrong. Black
people must continue and intensify
their efforts to reform the system and
improve their conditions. I'm just
calling upon White people to dotheir
part to assist in the effort by organizing other people of European descent
to help. However, while you're organizing, I'd suggest that you make
your intentions very clear to Black
people and make sure that you're
addressing true problems faced by
Black Americans and not thosewhich
you may have idealized in some secluded neighborhood or read in books.
I know this task may seem extremely difficult and many of you
may not believe that Black people
face any problems in this society. I
also understand that a good portion of
you may take issue with what I've
just said. Nonetheless, I suggest you
do the research, get a full understanding of life beyond the boundaries of
your comfortable existence and do
what you have to do. In 1992, the
powderkeg created by festering problems in the Black community exploded in Los Angeles. Next time, I
predict that it will be unleashed in all
parts of the country, even in everpeaceful suburbia.

Piecemeal 'Solutions' Won't Cure Hate Speech
Recent incidents
involving hate speech
have clearly brought
the topic to the fore
of campus discussion.
Here, an editor of
OURstory offers her
perspective.
By

Erin Ruble

Hate speech. Sidewalks, conversations, buildings' walls—it has torn

the face of the campus. Students
meet it withshock: though we know
things aren't perfect here, we at least

hope that Swarthmore is protected
from such intrusive hatred. This
college consists of some of the most
intelligent, politically aware students
in the country, committed to continuing the Quaker tradition of support and tolerance. And yet, some-

how, this is an environment permissive of such egregious offenses.
I sat in the Meeting House, listening
to an hour-long discussion about how
to deal with hate speech in early November. The Collection was not allcampus by any means; perhaps 100
students, faculty, and staff were scatteredalong the pews. Halfway through
the hour the discussion really began,
and it continued full-speed until,
promptly at 2 o'clock, it was terminated, leaving many comments (including my own) unheard. I walked
out the doorfuming. Partial attendance
at a workshop here, a discussion there
that'sdissectedinto two separate weeks
and locations; it's just not enough.
The administration's solutions won't
solve things. First, the response is not
direct enough. The committee tried so
hard to protect free speech while it
condemned hate speech that it ended
up changing little in existing policy. In
fact, as Abbe Blum pointed out during
the Collection, the new policy can actually be seen as more lenient than the
old. This is not a resounding censure
of these acts ofhatred. Second, as Sam

Schulhofer-Wohl '9B said, creating a
committee(as positive as that can be)
can allow students to think
everything's being taken care of.
That's a problem, because it is the
community alone which can finally
stop these incidences by showing an
absolute lack of sympathy for them.
The Administration's and a
committee's opinion matter less to
students than other students' anger.
Finally, attacking these issues on a
case-by-case basis is ludicrous without concurrently changing the campus environment. These responses
come from somewhere. Trying to
punish largely anonymous offenders
each time something happens isn't
going to work. The violence the acts
do to individuals and the community
cannot be erased. And individual reprisals do not touch the underlying
issue.
We need to understand the causes
of hate speech at Swarthmore. Students here are generally wellintentioned; I'm continually impressed by what students know and
how much they really care about issues ranging from race relations on
campus to poverty in Chester to human rights abuses across several
oceans, in Burma.
I think the great majority of people
here are genuinely committedto making this a tolerant, comfortable space.
However, students come here from
all around the country and world.
Each student has a different level of
awareness of what living on a diverse
campus really entails.
We cannot assume that no one here
has racist, sexist, homophobic, or
other prejudiced thoughts. We all do.
How aware we are of them, and how
we deal with them, varies, as does
howcomfortable we are in this space.
It can be hard for people who come
from homogeneous communities to
be immediately comfortable with
people of differentreligions, politics,

backgrounds, and sexual orientations.
And it can be even harder not to
offend unwittingly.
This does not excuse behavior that
threatens or disquiets others. But it is
a way to stop it. Unless we address
the fact that all students could use
education about how to deal with a
diverse community, very little will
change. Many of the less egregious
violationscome from sheer ignorance
about what is and isn't appropriate.
Therefore, there should be a community and especially administrative
effort to educate students. Although
groups such as the Race Groups,
Knapsackcrs, and OURstory have

Furthermore, there seems to be no
correlation between ethnicities with
high poverty rates and those with
large numbers of immigrants, which
is something that we might expect if
immigration status were the dominating factor in determining poverty.
For example, although Hmong and
Filipinos have almost identical proportions of foreign born residents,
they have poverty rates of 63.6 and
6.4 percent respectively.
Likewise, although 79.9 percent of
Vietnameseand 79.1 percent ofCambodians are foreign born, their respective poverty rates are 25.7 and
42.6 percent. Given the data, itis not
possible to conclude that the correlation between foreign born status and
poverty rates is non-existent, but it is
obvious that it is largely irrelevant in
the face of other factors, such as race
and ethnicity.
The dramatic differences in poverty rates between the various Asian
ethnicities uncover the high degree
of income inequality among AsianAmericans.
While two ethnicities, the Japanese and the Filipinos, have poverty
rates of seven percent or below, others, especially those of Southeast
Asia, have poverty rates of 25 percent and beyond. Even Chinese and
Koreans, two ethnicities generally
thought to be relatively successful,
have poverty rates of approximately
14 percent.
An examination of per capita incomes yields similar results. For
example, the per capita income of the
wealthiestAsian ethnicity, the Japanese, is over seven times higher than
the per capita income of the poorest
Asian ethnicity, the Hmong.
While a couple ofAsian ethnicities
havemade substantial gains, it is clear
that a vast majority of the Asian races
still suffer from relatively, and in
some cases appallingly, low per capita
incomes and high poverty rates.
Therefore, the "economic success"
ofAsian-Americansis merely a myth,
and a dangerous one at that. This
myth prevents many Asian-Americans from accessing programs and
resources, such as Affirmative Action, that might help them up the
socioeconomic ladder. Worse still, it
breeds divisiveness among the different minority groups, preventing
them from uniting and working cooperatively towards expanded opportunities for all.

To the Editor,
Following NazimaKadir's article,
"Ascribe to the Model Minority
Myth? Think Again," that appeared
in The Phoenix several weeks ago,
there has been some debate over
whether the "myth of the model minority" is actually a myth or not.
Some argue that because AsianAmerican households have higher
median incomes than white households, Asian-Americans have no need
for Affirmative Action or other programs intended to help minorities. A
close examination of the matter, however, reveals that median household
income is a deceptive statistic, that
Asian-Americans suffer from high
poverty rates that are directly correlated with their ethnicities, and that a
high degree ofincome inequality exists between differing groups of
Asian-Americans.
Examining median household income, one finds that the median income of an Asian-American family,
at $41,629, is $5,508 higher than the
$36,121 earned by the average white
family. Unfortunately, this statistic
is deceptive at best. If average family
income were an accurate measure of
economic well-being, we could easily double the nation's welfare simply by consolidating a number families. What the statistic fails to take
into account is the fact that AsianAmerican families are generally
larger than white families. The reason that Asian-American families
earn more is simply thatAsian-American families tend to have more workers. For example, 20 percent ofAsianAmericans families have three or
more workers, as opposed to the national average of 13 percent. Adjusting for family size reveals thatthe per
capita income ofAsian-Americans is
only $ 13,806, significantly lower than
the $14,896 per capita income of
whites.
More disturbingly, the AsianAmerican poverty rate is 14.6 percent, substantially higher than the
white poverty rate of 8.5 percent.
Some might claim that this difference is due solely to the fact that a
majority of Asian-Americans are
immigrants. I have a better explanation: a large number ofAsian-Americans, both foreign- and native-born,
are poor. According to 1990 government figures, foreign-born AsianAmericans actually have a per capita
income that is 3.9 percent higher than
that ofnative bornAsian-Americans.

Maxims from My
Her Mother

Have

you ever known a person (just for
simplicity's sake, let's call him Spencer, or maybe Josh. Yes, let's call him
Josh. Josh is such a nice name) who, every
time he came into your room, would play
with and eventually break every possession
you held dear? I mean Josh would do things
like take your slippers, hang them from his
ears, and pretend he was Leonard Nimoy. Or
perhaps he would remove his leather belt and
use it to whip your most valued possession, a
glow-in-the-dark statue of the Virgin Mary.
And as you sat there, listening to the makeshift whip crack against the sacred plastic
head of Jesus' mother, immobilized by a
mixture of intrigue and disgust and unable to
interfere, did you ask yourself why Josh's
mother didn't kill him many, many years
before this? How did she put up with this for
those 18 long years before Swat was lucky
enough to find him?
I don't think a person such as this (Josh is
what we are calling him, right?) would have
survived long in my household. No, my mom
believed devoutly in that old maxim, best
understood by me when it was screeched at
the top of her lungs and accompanied by a
jerk backwards by a firm hand on my shoulder, "Don't touch that!"
My mom, in fact, had many such maxims
that she has imparted to me at the top of her
lungs.
One ofmy very favoritesand one thatI also
think is quite applicable to all you Swatties
out there is, "Always point your feet and your
head in the same direction." Think about it for
a minute if you've never heard this one before. Feet. Head. Same direction. I'll give
you an example. Say you're walking out of
the serving area in Sharpies headed toward
themiddle room, your tray piled high withthe
luscious offerings of the Fried Thing Bar, and
you spy from the corner of your eye some
tapioca nestled gently on the condiment bar.
Your heart begins to accelerate because you
have not had any of this creamy white goodness in many months. You can hardly believe
what you have
This situation definitely needs further investigation, so you turn
your head distinctly toward the tapioca before the rest ofyour body has had time to react
to the complex, euphoric signalsbeing sent to
it by your happy, happy brain. You are, therefore, walking forward as your head is turned
to the side.
Suddenlyyou are stopped by a large, fleshy
mass that was, unbeknownst to you, directly
in your path. Perhaps it is even me, if you are
lucky. The air is suddenly filled with the
sounds of dishes crashing to the floor as the
ground and myself are decorated with your
onion rings. Itis not going to be a pretty sight.
I really don't like onion rings. This is why
you should always point your feet and head in
the same direction.
Another good bit of advice Mom gave me
was, "Don'trun with alollipop in yourmouth."
Of course, it really isn't a good idea to run
with anything long and hard in your mouth,
but your safer sex facilitator has probably
already told you that.
You've probably heard the old saying,
"Never put anything smallerthan your elbow
in your ear." Many a man has tragically gone
deaf from a misplaced green pea, I'm sure.
Actually, I have a couple ofquestions about
this ear-elbow saying. I mean, is it okay to put
someone else's elbow in your ear or is it only
your own elbow that is legit? Some people
have some pretty small elbows, you know.
Pygmies, for example. Does it even have to
be a human elbow, though? Squirrels and
hamsters have really small elbows. I bet a
hamster's elbow could easily pierce your
eardrum.
And they'd do it to if they could. Those
hamsters are pretty sneaky, sitting up there on
your shoulder, pretending to be your friends,
and then suddenly they' ve got their elbows in
your ear.
You can't trust a hamster.
Yeah, that sure is one phrase I'm planning
on repeating to my own kids, "Never trust a
hamster."

Features Book Review: Andrew Sullivan's Virtually Normal

A Look at How the Many Americas View Gays
By

bits, cutting hair, and mixing different fabrics

Erik Huneke

Aside

from presenting an extremely
cogent and intelligent defense of gay
and lesbian equality, Virtually Normal, written by former editor and current
senior editor of The New Republic Andrew
Sullivan, constitutes the ultimate in intellectual mind candy. Where else can one find
such an eloquent author assume the viewpoints of the likes of Ralph Reed,
Michel Foucault, Bill Clinton, and
Mario Cuomo only to thenrefute
each and every one? Perhaps I
haven't searched very far, but I
have yet to find a treatise in which
a Ronald Reagan would try to
adopt the mindset of aRuPaul, or
vice versa.
Sullivan frames his arguments
with personal anecdotes at the
beginning and end of the work,
which include his boyhood fear
thathe was "not broad-shouldered
enough" and did not go through
puberty early enough to be 'considered fully male. He presents
his experiences as ones with which
many other gays can identify and
through which non-gays can understandthe personal motivations
behind his political reasoning.
In describing his frustrated
sense of longing for one his male
friends early in his life, Sullivan
reveals the self-denial which accompanied the development of
his nascent gay identity: "It was
feeling that that part of the malemale bond that worked—the part
that works with most heterosexual
male-male friendships—was also
the part that destroyed the possibility of another, as yet opaque
but far more complete longing
that for me, but not for him, was
inextricable from the relationship.
It was a sense that longing was based on a
structural lack of reciprocity; that love was
about being accepted on the condition that
you suppressed what you really felt."
It is the necessity for such self-denial that
causes Sullivan to reject what he considers to
be the prevailing views of homosexuality.
Conservatives who consider heterosexuality
to be the natural state of being for everyone
believe that homosexuals must come to realize that it is only a state ofillness or confusion
which has caused them to deviate from this
supposed norm. Many turn to the Bible to
foster their belief in the immorality of samesex relationships. But Sullivan points out that
Leviticus opposed eating shellfish and rab-

in a single piece of clothing as vehemently as
he opposed sexual contact between people of
the same sex. But there don't seem to be any
Defense of Bunny Rabbits Act in the works,
and I don't see recently unseated California
Congressman Robert Dornan getting worked
up about polyester/cotton blend dress shirts.
The liberationists agree with the conservatives that homosexuality does not or should

not exist, but for rather different reasons.
Liberationists consider it to be a "construct of
human thought, not an inherent or natural
state of being" which reflects more the desire
forpower of those who created the terminology than the actions or feelings of those to
whom it is applied. (If this reminds you of
Foucault, you have in fact been keeping up
with your reading lately!) Yet Sullivan cites
the übiquity of flirtatious glances between
members of the same sex in differentcultures
as a sign that some things are not purely social
constructs. And the resilient autonomy of
witty activism in the gay community demonstrates the ability of people to expand their
behavior beyond what i<= dictate' by those

social constructs. And liberationists, through
such methods as outing, actually fosterrather
than undermine the social constructs that
make their actions seem so risque" in the first
place. Theirs ultimately becomes a politics of
"performance," in which they don't really
care how the outside world reacts because
"the point ofbeing queer is the deployment of
shock, of difference, of subversion, or otherness."
Conservatives' tendency to eschew
government intervention in private
life but sanction efforts to encourage
some forms of behavior over others
is not a viable balance. They would
not be "alarmed to meet a homosexual at a dinner party (indeed, they
may even find itfashionable to invite
one or two)," but hope that gays
would carry out their relationships
discretely to deter "waverers" from
engaging in what is implicitly assumed to be misguided behavior.
Sullivan's chapter on liberalism
contains the most unconvincing arguments of the book. He feels that
government can do little to mitigate
discriminatory interactions in the private sphere at least in part because
many gays and lesbians can "pass"
for straight and because homosexuality is less easily defined than race.
More convincing are his assertions
that such ordinances are least likely
to be found where gays and lesbians
need them most, and that it is more
useful for the state to reform its own
discriminatory practices than try to
change individuals' attitudes.
More effective in changing these
attitudes would be equal access to
marriage and military service on the
state level. He thinks that the "most
enduring legacy of the civil rights
movement" was not "its panoply of
complicated and cumbersome laws,
but the memory of the simple courage of those who stood up in the face of
considerable danger for their dignity and their
equality." "Real progress" in the fight for
equality can be achieved by acts of coming
out to friends, family, and coworkers.
It is for this reason that Sullivan's choice of
Virtually Normal as his title is a curious one.
While this is perhaps intended as an ironic
reference to the limits of tolerance in even the
most tolerant of heterosexual societies conceivable, it seems a somewhat careless use of
language in a book which otherwise displays
considerable sensitivity to the development
ofrhetoric and its consequences. Or it might
just leave the prohibitionists scratching their
heads for awhile...

Andrew Sullivan spoke about
Virtually Normal on November 19 at Giovanni's Room, a
bookstore in Philly devoted to
gay, lesbian, and feminist
works. Since his book was first
released over a year ago, the
fight for equal access to marriage for same-sex partners has
come to the forefront of political discourse. He does not view
the backlash, as exemplified
by the passing by Congress and
signing by President Bill Clinton of the Defense of Marriage
Act, as cause for despair. The
fact that opponents of gay and
lesbian equality have fought so
vigorously to limit access to
marriage and military service
shows the value of fighting for
these goals. And in some ways,
supporters of gay and lesbian
rights are at an advantage.
While the religious right must
worry about whether any state
approves same-sex marriage,
its recognition in any state
would represent a gain for its
advocates. Other states might
be forced to recognize the validity other states' actions, despite the attempts of the Defense of Marriage Act to prevent this. He cited the following example: if a lesbian married couple with two kids from
Hawaii were vacationing in
Utah, and the biological mother
of both children died, the court
would most likely be compelled
to grant custody of the children
to the surviving partner. He
noted that even more progress
could have been attained had
the Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA) been passed, an observation which Sullivan notes had
first been made by Phyllis
Schlafly, who is not renowned
for her avid support of gay
rights.

Newly-Chartered Muslim Students Association Has High Hopes

Council recently granted a char-

ter to the Muslim Students Associa-

tion, founded by Ethan Devine 'OO and
Shamsah Ebrahim '99. The group intends to

provide support and greater access to religious services for Muslim students, more
courses relating to Islam in the curriculum,
and a greater awareness about Islam in general.
There have been several attempts in previous years to start a Muslim Students Association, but none were successful. Although
initially promising, the membership of these
groups gradually declined due to work and
other obligations, and thus never managed to
get chartered.
The current group is mostly drivenby mem-

bers of the class of 2000.

dents want to provide a safe, comfortable
group setting in which Muslim students can
share experiences and opinions that might be
foreign to the College in general. Many students find it difficult to be Muslim at Swarthmore, although the College environment is
not hostile. "It's probably more welcoming
because of the Quaker tradition," said Devine,
but the number of Muslims on campus is so
small that it is hard to create a cohesive
community.
One of the primary goals of the Muslim
Students Association is to increase the representation ofIslam in the academic sphere of
the College. There is currently only one Muslim professor at S warthmore, Faruq Siddiqui,
associate professor of engineering. The students would like to see more Muslim professors as well as more classes and perhaps a

department or concentration in Islamic studies. For example, in order to learn Arabic,
students must go to Penn, which is inconvenient and time consuming.
The Muslim Students Association has plans
for many activities in the future. The students
see raising awareness of Islam and dispelling
some of the myths that surround it as part of
the purpose of thegroup.So far, they put have
put up signs explaining some of the more
commonly misunderstood concepts of Islam,
such as jihad. The students would also like to
show movies and bring in speakers on such
topics as the oppression of women and the
relation ofIslam to the West. They also plan
to give out free copies of the Qu'ran and
answer questions about Islam, and hold an
end of Ramadan feast open to the College
community.

It's

a little known fact that LaDeva
Davis, tap instructor at Swarthmore,
once fronted a band with that impressive name—a "nightclub act" playing
"commercial R&B and jazz." To those
who know her, though, this should not be
too surprising.

"I've always been a busy little
beaver," Davis says. That's definitely one way to put it. We found
her with a class ofSwarthmore students. Davis was wearing an audacious silver leotard as she taught.
To us uncoordinated observers, the
group seemed to be performing wondrous feats (sorry about the bad
pun), butDavis disagreed. Her criticism was affectionate, however, and
the class was soon diligently repeating the routine.
A few minutes later in her office,
Davis sat in front of a large poster of
Yoga positions and told us about
what she did when not barking comfM
mands to Swattie tapper droves.
She teaches class here on Monday and Wednesday nights; on other
nights she works in the Channel 6
television studio. In conjunction
with the station Davis choreographed the Thanksgiving Parade
in Philadelphia. During the daytime
she works at the Philadelphia High School
for Creative and Performing Arts. Tuesday afternoons find her with kids in the
Chester Arts Center. On the side she has a
hobby: tropical ichthyology (i.e. a fish
tank); "I talk to my fish."
Itmay seem that her schedule is so busy
as to preclude fish discourse, but this is
only the current round of projects for
Davis. In the past she has done everything
from studying Kung Fu in Philadelphia to
hosting a televised cooking show. Televised cooking show? That's right. It was
called What's Cooking ? The program was
designed to help people "eat right" and
"save money"; she describes it as
"hysterical...l was a really funny cook!"
As a chef, she claims, "I've been in every

Las Vegas a Poignant Hit; Vertigo Provoking

Swordsmen
& Cyberpunk

By Emily
&

Shartin

Andy Murray

Anyone

who knows the tragic lore surrounding the making ofMikeFiggis'
movie Leaving Las Vegas can assume that watching the flick will not be like
listening to the Sheryl Crow song of the same
title.
The film is based on a semi-autobiographical novel whose author, John O'Brien, committed suicide just weeks after plans to make
the film were confirmed. But although it is a
rough-going ride, Leaving Las Vegas is also
a poignant and remarkable achievement that
is worth seeing.
The film stars Nicholas Cage in an Academy award-winning performance as Ben

Tooting His Own Horn

College Orchestra performance at
8 p.m. in Lang Concert Hall.
Conducted by Arne Running, the
program includes "Carnival
Overture" by Dvorark; Symphony
No. Bin B Minor, "Unfinished," by
Schubert; "Prelude to the
Afternoon of a Faun," by Debussy;
and "Capriccio Italien," by
Tchaikovsky.

Sanderson, a depressed widower who drinks
himself out of his job. He then decides to use
his severance check to settle down in Vegas,
this time to drink himself to death.
On his first night in the city he meets Sera
(Elisabeth Shue), a tougher-than-nails prostitute, whom he eventually hires, not for sex,
but simply to have someone to talk to. Sera is

moved by Ben and soon asks him to move in
with her. He agrees only on one condition:
that she never ask him to stop drinking.
The two main characters are amazingly
well-portrayed. Cage is unforgettable as Ben,
adding moments of extremely sarcastic humor to Leaving Las Vegas that you are sometimes unsure how to react to. For all ofBen's
nastiness after he's knocked back a fifth of
vodka, Cage still manages to keep Ben a
likable character without over-sentimentalizing him.
Shue plays a heartbreaking Sera, who must
watch the man whom she's finally found a bit
of happiness with kill himself, all the while
promising not to say a damn thing about it. In
one of the more touching moments of the
film, she even presents Ben with the gift of a
flask she's bought for him.
The movie is broken up every now and then
with shots ofSera remembering her timewith
Ben; we assume she's talking to a shrink, but
are never really sure.
The relationship between Sera and Ben
becomes complicated on aconventional level,
and yet incredibly simple on a more personal
level. It doesn't matter that she is a hooker
and he is a drunkard, and it isn't at all weird
that they never have sex until the very end;
you know all along that they simply accept
and love each other.
When Sera takes the vow to stay quiet
about Ben's drinking, you understand that
theirs is as unconditional a relationship as
you could hope to find. In this sense,Leaving
Las Vegas manages to seduce you with a
feeling of strange beauty underlying its brutality and tough subject matter.
Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is one of the
most critically acclaimed films by America's
master of suspense, but it is certainly not an
easy film to watch. Apart from the complicated mystery that composes the film's
storyline, the use of animation and color in
Vertigo at times reaches an extreme that is
distracting and the film raises disturbing questions of male viewing of the female form.
Scottie (James Stewart) is a San Francisco
police detective who nearly loses his life and

Ghost

in the Shell is an anime, a Japanese animatedfilm marked by fantastic artwork. Created by the same team
that did the near-legendary Akira, Ghost in
the Shell is a cyberpunk tale of super-tech
crime in the information age.
Set in a world where a global dataweb of
consciousness links humanity, certain hightech warriors have supernatural abilities like
shape-shifting, invisibility, and body-swapping brought about by their abilities to project
their consciousness into machines. Several of
these superpowerful ghost-commandos attempt to track down the biggest cybercriminal
of them all.
The soundtrack and the visuals pack most
of the punch for this story; U2 contributes a
five-minute song, and other quirky, technology-heavy music complements the high-tech
action. Ghost in theShell broke all records for
anime sales when it went on the market last
year; it was the top selling video in the country for a solid month. Find out why.
"There can be only one!"
Highlander has become an institution,
spawning two sequels and a silly TV series.
The original is far superior, though. The plot
is simple: a bunch of immortals who cannot
die except by having their heads cut off. They
are engaged in a battle to the death; whichever wins gets some sort of vaguely-defined
universal power. They thus run around modern-day society chopping each other up with
big blades.
Sure, it's cheesy. However, it's an excellent film. Christopher Lambert makes a fine
hero. Moody Scottish warfare, lots ofrandom
sword fights, love, and giant nasty superstrong punks with HUGE pecs.
The Kurgan, the chief baddie, is among the
most truly nasty, evil fellows ever portrayed
in action films. All of the fight scenes are
exciting and well-choreographed; the action
is breathtaking. And did I mention the Queen
soundtrack? That's reason enough to go to
the film, in my opinion.
It's the perfect film to watch during finals:
light on plot, long on flashing blades and
mayhem.
SWIL will be showing Ghost in the Shell
on Monday, December 9. Highlander will be
shown on Monday, December 16. Both play
at 10 p.m. in Kirby Lecture Hall.

B-Ball Struggles to
Prove Its Mettle

Swim Team Makes
a Splash in Meet
By Tyler

Stevenson

On the Tuesday before Thanksgiving Break, Swarthmore's swim team
hosted Widener at Ware Pool in their
first home meet of the year. In this
past Saturday's win against Drew
University, the influenceof the home
crowd and the excitementof actually
being on campus droveboth the men's
and women's team to huge wins with
scores of 138-63 (women) and 13471 (men).
The women' s team opened the meet
with a first and second place finish in
the 200 Medley Relay. The winning
relay was composed of captain
Kristen Robertson '9B, JennyHarvey
'99, Cathy Polinsky '99, and Kim
Killeen '97 with a time of 1:58.29.
The second place relay of captain
Alice Unger '9B, Melissa AmirArjomand 'OO, Jill Belding '99, and
Claire Arbour 'OO touched less than a
second later.
The 200 Freestyle relay also did
well, with Elizabeth Newcomb 'OO,
Janine Gent'99, Erica Rosenthal 'OO,
and Jamie Flather 'OO swimming a
1:50.00.
Relay members also had some
amazing individual swims. Belding
tore open the 1000 yard Freestyle
with an 11:22.85 and also went a
2:23.45 in the 200 IM. AmirArjomand made the lOOßreaststroke

one of the most exciting races of the
day by out-touching her Widener
opponent in 1:14.17.
Robertson ripped the 100 Backstroke in half with a 1:03.67. Arbour
and Unger made the 500 Freestyle
interesting with times of 5:35.70 and

5:36.85.
Other stellar swims came from
Molly Marino '9B, who shattered the
200 IM with a 2:18.78 and the 100
Freestyle with a 57.60. Janine Gent
'99 also demoralized the competition
with her 26.45 in the 50 Free. Liz
Blair 'OO showed her adaptability by
going a 11:45.83 in the 1000Freestyle
with a 59.51 in the 100 Freestyle.
The men's team also showedWidenerathingortwo. Despite Widener's
decent sprinters, Carl Sanders '9B
won both of his individual events,
swimming a 22.16 in the 50 Freestyle
and a 49.44 in the 100 Freestyle.
Andy Robbins '9B (23.34) and Eric
Haeker '99 (24.33) placed third and
fourth in the 50Freestyle. Swarthmore
was also well-represented in the 100
Freestyle by Haeker (53.27), Tsong
Lin 'OO (57.42), and Paul Dickson
'OO, who swam a stunning 52.36.
Men's distance swimmers also did
well for themselves. In the 1000
Freestyle Chris Seaman '99 finished
in a 11:01.43, Earley at a 10:45.41,
and Wasser with all :08.49. Seaman

many easy buckets off the offensive
boards. Houseal led the Garnet with
12 points and nine boards, earning
her a spot on theConference' s weekly
honor roll.
"I think it was the old Swat mentality of justplaying not to lose, instead
of believing that we can win; but, I'd
say that if Johns Hopkins was the best
that our league has to show, then we
should be psyched about where we
could potentially end up this year,
and how many games we should win,"
said Cochran-Bond.
Washington College was the
Garnet's next opponent and a tremendous effort by Swarthmore trickled into a loss. WC finished one spot
ahead of the Garnet in the conference
standings last year, and Swarthmore
was eagerly anticipating an upset.
WC clung to a one-point lead at
halftime. Erin Greeson '99 did a terrific job shutting down WC's best
player, limiting her to five points.
The upset seemed secured when she
fouled out with plenty of time remaining. Swarthmore failed to take
advantage on offense, and a few good
sequences by WC turned the game
back in their favor.

Thalia Mills 'OO said, "The team is

said, "We match up well against the

we have an excellent opportunity to

teams to bond with no escape forfour

Last week's CentennialConference
statistics placed Swarthmore fourth
in scoring defense and second in the
conference for field goal percentage

30.7% from the field). If the Garnet
can key their offense to meet the
strength and intensity of their defense, they should have a successful
season.

The Swarthmore men's basketball

and character in the first two weeks
of the season.
The Garnet stunned many observers with two decisive victories in the
season-opening Equinox Classic tournament and a heart-stopping victory
Tuesday over its first Centennial Conference opponent, Johns Hopkins.
Pomona-Pitzer and Stevens Tech
were relative unknowns coming into
the tournament. Both teams were
coming off strong seasons in 199596 where they finished 14-9 and 1511 respectively.
The Garnet took the game to the

from
the
outset.
Swarthmore's stable of quick guards
and versatile forwards was able to
keep Pomona's defenders off-balance. Early buckets by Aaron Bond
'97 and Ben Schall '97 on the inside
were key to giving the Garnet guards
room to operate on the perimeter.
"We're a tough team to match up
against. We' ve got some pretty gnarly
players," said A.J. Shanley '97.
Colin Convey '97 led all scorers
with 18 points including three threepointers. He and Tim Schofield '99
(10 points) saw most of the time at

followed, they have settled into their

roles.
Role-playing has been a primary
ingredient in the Garnet's success. In
the first five games, four different
players have led the team in scoring.
"The senior core has been playing
together for so long we recognize
each other's capabilities and know
that the season will depend on how
we perform. No one cares about certain stats because everyone knows
we have a common goal," said
Shanley.
