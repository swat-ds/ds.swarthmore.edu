Former Haitian

President
Speaks in Philly
Aristide sends message

by lAN HANSEN

of peace and cooperation
by EUGENE SONN
Father Jean Bertrand Aristide, deposed
President of Haiti, spoke to an audience of
students, activists and members of the local
Haitian community on Monday at theUniversity Museum at Perm. In his speech and the
question and answer period which followed,
Aristide stressed building solidarity between
Haitians and Americans to work for justice
and democracy.
In what he termed "a dialogue to share
and learn," Aristidefirst described several of
the more gruesome aspects of life in Haiti
under the military regime. On December 5,
1992, Aristide said, the military arrested and
shot eight Haitians. One survived and was
taken to the hospital. "Thenthe military came
into the hospital, and shot him in the bed," he
said.
Even though the people ofHaiticontinue
to be oppressed, Aristide said he was sure he
would eventually return to power. "That's
why we are so hapy to be with you—white
Americans, African Americans—to build
solidarity with you," he said.
Aristide repeatedly cited the importance
of education in building democracy and solidarity. He reminded the audience that Haiti
has an 85% illiteracy rate. He said, "without
an education, [a citizen] must impose his
troubles on others and he lo[ses] contact with
his true feelings—feelings of dignity, of wisdom, of love, of solidarity."
Aristide spoke of the great problems his
country faces and how during his seven months
in power he promoted a "democracy which
puts the person first." "Put the person first
before money, first before power, first before
drugs, first before corruption," he added.
He didnot limithis comments to Haiti's
condition. Hecited figures showing the inordinate percentage of prison inmates in the
U.S. who are black, saying, "All that will be
different when day after day we put the person
first." He continued, "Make the world better
through justice, through democracy."

analogies todescribe thedistributionof wealth

in Haiti and how he would change it. "On that
table we have less than one percent with more
than 45% of the national wealth; under the
table we have 85% illiterate. On the table, we
have an army of7,000 people who get 40% of
the national budget; under the table, we have
6,000 Haitians with no food at all."
"We do not want to bring those who are
up on the table down and put those under the
table up—that would be vengeace—we believe in God, [and] God is love, so we say no
to vengance," he said. "But at the same time,
we believe the spirit of God is justice and we
should share around the table, not under the
table," he added.
He ended his speech with a final call for
solidarity, repeating his most famous saying:
"Alone we are weak, together we are strong,
altogether we are a deluge."
Although he is a Catholic priest, and
because he subscribes to a theology ofliberation, Aristide has had a tumultuous relationship with the Vatican. Two members of the
audience asked him about his relationship
with Rome and heresponded, "The Vatican is
the only state in the world which blesses the
criminals [military leaders] in Haiti." However, Aristide said he looks forward to a time
when he and the Vatican can fulfill the mission set forth by the Second Vatican Council
"which described the church as the people of
God."

Aristide stressed non-violent struggle in
all situations, but one audience member questioned how he could advocate non-violence
when his military opponents will continue
violence against the Haitianpeople. Aristide
answered, "They would be happy to see me
condone violence; they wouldbe happy to see
some people with guns. This would justify
their violence, but we will not fall into their
trap." "You have a right to defend yourself,
but use a non-violent strategy," he declared.
When asked about what the U.S. and
U.N. havebeen doing toreturn him to power,
President Aristide said a plan to bring observers to Haiti to document human rights violations shows a step in the right direction, but
that "in two or three months, I have to be back
in Haiti."
One woman, a Haitian whois studying at
Temple University, accused PresidentAristide
of promoting violence whilehe was in power.
Specifically, she said he condoned
"necklacing"—a practice in which a tire is
thrown over someone's head, gasoline poured
on that person and the person burned alive.
Aristide calmly responded "I respect you. I
tell you what you have said is totally wrong."
Aristide later invited the woman to come and
speak with him after the speech to further
discuss the issue and they spent about ten
minutes together after the questions were
through.

With frantic George Bush-like hand

Attitudes Must Change Class Examines Issues in El Salvador

who had been
assaulted at the Old Club. The
woman said in her letter that she
had spoken to friends who toldher

The women I spoke with all
use a huge list of defense mechanisms to minimize the risk ofbeing assaulted or made to feel uncomfortablewhiletrying to have a
good time at Old Club or other
parties.
"You try to be careful of what
you wear. You can't dress at all
provocatively ," said one, "you
dance in groups with friends and
make sure you dance perpendicularly to any guy you don'tknow."
Another woman said she always
goes to Old Club with a guy because "no one will hassle you if
they think you're with someone."
"It's a common way ofmeeting girls to walk up pelvis first," a
woman said. "I feel I'm not part of
this [attitude] that this is an acceptable thing. The problem of
defining what is acceptable and
intolerable behavior is a crucial
problem in dealing with sexual
assault and harassment.
Dean NginaLythcott said she
has handled cases of sexual assault andharassment in whichperpetrators did not feel their actions
were inappropriate. Lythcott attributes the difficulty in defining
appropri ate behavior to thediverse
backgrounds ofstudents at Swarthmore. "They come from communities where theseactions are common and acceptable," she said.
Patricia Whitman, the special assistant to the president on
women's concerns, feels that it is
difficult for our community to define appropriate behavior, but said
"any community which tolerates
[sexual] harassment or intimidation breeds assault." She hopes to
increase the number of programs
on these issues in the next year.
The college currently has two
committees to address the issue.
The Judicial Review Committee
is looking at the current judicial
system in regards to sexual assault
and harassment complaints. There
are several routes to file a complaint, including through the college judicial system and through
the Dean's committee.
Whitman, member of the
committee and said, "We're stopping and looking at these procedures and saying; 'Should we integrate the several procedures for
"

filing a complaint? And how do
we do this so we protect due process rights, but not at the expense
of the victim?"*
The other committee, theTask
Force to Prevent Sexual Assault
and Harassment, spent last semester assessing the policies of other
colleges and making suggestions
to the Judicial Review Committee. This semester, they are trying
to gather information about sexual
harassment and gender intimidation on campus:
"We don't live in a vacuum
here; everyone comes in with stereotypical gender roles," said
Elaine Metherall, co-chair of the
task force.The task force has sofar
consideredhow to create more opportunities, throughout each
student's time on campus, to be
educated and discuss these issues.
But Suzannah Cole '94, the
coordinator of the Survivors of
Sexual Assault group on campus,
said this isn't enough. "No action
has been taken," she said. Cole
feels that part of the blame for the
low number of people who actually report being assaulted lies with
the perceived inability of the college to deal with the issues.
Whitman said the fear of reporting goes much deeper.
"Women are afraid they won't be
believed, they fear retaliation by
the assailants and their friends,"
she said. "They also just don't
want to share this experience with
anyone, even if it's confidential,"
she added.
Cole adds that the worst part
is that victims internalize the incident and think maybe they brought
it upon themselves. "I was raped
and I didn't get angry for nine
months," she said.

Indeed, Lythcott said it happens "all too often" that victims
begin to question their every step
they take and every precaution they
might have taken but did not.
One woman I spoke with said
the problem is not just with men
shedoesn'tknow. "Sometimes it's
friends of mine and you feel uncomfortablebecause they are dancing too close, so I have to push
themaway," she said. "I feel like a
bitch, especially when his friends
are around. I wish there were a
nice way to get rid of this, not a
school rule or a law."
m Swarthmore's grand fashion, the college has agreed to study
the issue, but it remains to be seen
how they will act upon this new
wealth of information. Until then,
women on campus will warily go
to Old Club and other parties, in
search of some fun and dancing
and trying to avoid being assaulted.
For anyone who has been assaulted or abused sexually, the Survivors meetings take place on
Tuesday from
p.m. in
Panish Annex Lounge.

New Gay Rights Group Forms
by BARBARA

LEY, JUSTIN PAULSON and LEAH OPPENHEIM

This Tuesday, March 2, at 10 p.m. in the big IC room there will be an
organizational meeting for all students and staff (regardless of sexual orientation)
interested in pursuing social and political activism and awareness pertaining to gay,
lesbian and bisexual rights.
As three S warthmore college students concerned with issues regarding sexual
orientation, we feel that the college community can benefit from a group dedicated
to discussing and facilitating change in these areas.
This group will have several objectives and ground rules. We would like to
focus on issues of equality and awareness both on and off the Swarthmore College
campus. Also, we want to foster interaction between the homosexual, heterosexual,
and bisexual communities at Swarthmore. Because the membership will not be
limited, no assumptions can be made about the participants' sexual orientation.
Members can disclose information about their sexuality at their own discretion.
This group's success will depend on the amount of energy and ideas generated
by those who want to get involved, so please come. If you have any questions,
comments, or '•"teems, feel free to contact one of us.

This spring semester offers a
unique opportunity for the sixteen
Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr, and
Haverford College students in a
Swarthmore Soc/Anth class called
"Ecology, Peace, and Development
in El Salvador." This interdisciplinary class is being co-taught by
Miguel Diaz-Barriga, assistant professor of Soc/Anth at Swarthmore,
and Juan Jose Garcia, professor of
sociology from the University of
Central America.
The class offers a detailed examination of many aspects of El
Salvador, using many primary
sources of information. Two key
topicsbeing examined are the peace
process and development issues.The
class represents an act of solidarity
with the University of Central
America in San Salvador, El Salvador on the part of Swarthmore College. The University of Central
America (UCA) plays an pivotal
role in shaping the political situation in El Salvador.
This course reflects the continuing efforts by Swarthmore College faculty to heighten awareness
about the situation in Central
America, and to show solidarity for
theirCentral American counterparts.
Swarthmore's interest in Central
America began in 1983 with a faculty seminar on Central America.
This seminar sought to heighten
awareness of the situation in Latin
America through participation in
such events as lectures, poetry readings, and letter writing to Congress.
On November 16,1989 six Jesuit priests were murdered in El
Salvador. This further heightened
awareness of the situation in El Salvador and stimulated a desire for
action by members of the Swarthmore College community.
Hugh Lacey, professor of philosophy, and Ken Sharpe, professor
of political science, had been using

the work of the Jesuits, who were
central academic and administrative figures at the University ofCentral America, in their seminars. In
reaction to the murders, JohnHassett
and Lacey constructed a detailed
bibliography of the significant works
of the priests, compiling English
translations of these works.
The idea was bom of setting up
a relationship with the University of
Central America (UCA), where the
Jesuits had been key faculty and
administrative members. Possibilities for setting up a connection were
discussed with Charlie Beime, an
American Jesuit who was about to
go to the UCA to become the associate vice-president. Other colleges
and universities in the Philadelphia
area,
including Villanova,
Haverford, Temple, Drexel, and the
University of Pennsylvania, formed
a coalition for a Philadelphia/El
Salvador exchange.
Swarthmore College, as the
driving force behind the coalition,
has establishedwhat Lacey calls the
"mini-exchange program" with the
UCA which began two years ago.
This biannual mini-exchange includes a three to four week visit by
a Swarthmore faculty member to
the UCA, and a visit by an UCA
faculty member to Swarthmore College. The faculty member has an
opportunity tomeet with othermembers of his/her field, and to give a
numberof lectures sponsored by the
university. Lacey was the first
Swarthmore faculty member to visit
the UCA, and lastyear Diaz-Barriga
went to El Salvador while El Salvadoran economist Elfonso Goita
came to the United States. DiazBarriga's visit to the UCA was surrounded by hopes of deepening the
relationship between Swarthmore
and the UCA. This was the beginning of planning for the "Ecology,
Peace, and Development in El Salvador" class.
GarciVs visit not only gives

S warthmoreand tri-college students
the opportunity to hear about El
Salvador first-hand, but offers the
possibility ofcollaboration between
Swarthmore and UCA faculty on
long-term projects. Diaz-Barriga
and Garcia plan to collaborate on
writing about the peace process in
El Salvador.
The students will be reading
current writings and journal articles
for the class, including El Salvador's
newspaper El Proceso. Previously
many of these materials were only
available in Spanish, and consequently preparation for this class
demanded a huge amount of translating work. Much of this translating was done by Spanish-speaking
Swarthmore students, including
Alicia Alonso, Sara Koopman, and
Adriana Lavergne.
For many students in the class
it offers an important channel for
their personal and academic interests. As Gerardo Aquino '96 remarked, "As a Guatemalan student
I took the class to better understand
the complexity of the area, since the
situation is not given much attention in the media."
Many people hope that eventually a student exchange program
will be made possible, although conditions in theregion at this time are
prohibitive. An equivalent version
of this class will also be taught at
UCA.
As Provost Jennie Keith said,
"Our relationship with the UCA has
already had important influence on
our curriculum, throughfaculty exchange in both directions, through
new courses and also by serving as
one of the important models for our
developing involvement with the
Chester/Swarthmore College Community Coalition.We certainly hope
that the UCA-Swarthmore link will
continue so that faculty and student
exchanges can be a regular part of
our education program."

Debaters Argue Their Way to the
Top, Prepare for Swat Tournament
by JOE LEAHY
For the first time in over two years, a team from

Swarthmore's Amos J. Peaslee Debate Society has

found itself in the winner's circle. At the Cornell
University Parliamentary Debate Tournament, held
over the weekend of February sth, one of Peaslee's top
teams —David Carney '94 and Neal Potischman '95
went all the way to the top. Carney and Potischman
walked through the five preliminary rounds with ease,
emerging undefeated, and were unscathed in their final
round defeat of a University of Pennsylvania team. The
eleven final round judges voted unanimously for the
Peaslee team, and then awarded them a generous silver
cup for their efforts.
For Peaslee, formerly a powerhouse on theAmerican Parliamentary Debate Circuit, the win at Cornell
marked only the second appearance in a final round in
the past two years (though the last Peaslee final round,
in 1991, was for the National Championship). Though
Cornell was a small tournament by any measure, with
only twenty-two teams from colleges and universities
in the North-East participating, it marked a great emotional victory for Peaslee.
Carney said of the win, "It was like a mental
barrier to us the past few years...nobody could win. I
think that after our victory at Cornell it will be much
easier for Peaslee to win tournaments in the future."
Indeed, though the society has been locked out of
final rounds for some time, its teams have been pushing
the envelope all year. "We have been so close to
breaking (making final round) several times this year,"
said another top Peaslee debater, AaronFeuer '94, "and
we have placed consistently in the top ten at tournaments. "Actually," added Aaron's partner, Jeremy
Mallory '95, "we thought that we would be the first
ones to break. I guess we'll just have to win the next big
one that comes along."
This spirit of competition may foster future wins

for Peaslee, and can't do much to hurt the individual
reputations of these young debaters, which are already
growing. Proof of this lies in the many individual
speaking awards that the teams have garnered in the
past year. For example, though a team win is no guarantee that debaters will win individual awards, Carney
and Potischman cleaned up in individual awards categories at Cornell. Carney took 2ndSpeaker overall and
2nd place in the Humorous Public Speaking competition, while Potischman took 4th Speaker overall and
won the Humorous Public Speaking competition.
It is hoped by all that Carney and Potischman's
solid performance at Cornell will be a draw for Swat's
upcoming tournament to be held the weekend of March
19th and 20th. The tournament is usually a popular one,
and should expect to drawabout 50 teams, even though
it is takes place during many schools' spring breaks.
Swatties are encouraged to attend the Peaslee tournament, especially the final round, to be held in Kirby
Lecture Hall at on Saturday evening. (It should be noted
that Peaslee doesn't hope to do nearly as well at its own
tournament as it did at Cornell—this is, of course,
because the host school never competes at its own
tournament!) The Society would also appreciate any
help hosting the tournament, and faculty and students
wanting to do so might consider judging a round or two.
Potischman said that judging is "a great chance to
feel superior to students from all those Ivy-league
schools you didn't get into! Plus, Peaslee is offering
special perks to all of our judges. Since we can really
use the help judging,please consider giving up even an
hour of your time to help us out." Those interested in
judging (or wanting to find out what free perks
Potischman was referring to) can contact him or Mallory,
the tournament co-directors.
Further, any students interested in debating should
know that Peaslee meets on Tuesday and Thursday
evenings at 9:30, upstairs inBond Hall. New members
or observers are always welcome.

Swarthmore Students' Plight Seen in Heaney Exhibit
by

FREEMAN O'BRIEN

While the bulk of Rachel Brown's exhibit of Seamus
Heaney's poem "Sweeney Astray" faded quickly from
McCabe's glass cases, her photographs lingered on the walls
of Swarthmore's dimly lit library. The striking black and
white pictorals provided rich visual images rivaled only by
those created in the imagination by Heaney's verse.
"Sweeney Astray" is an interpretation of the medieval
Irish work "Buile Shuibhne," a tale often alluded to in Irish
literature. The poem tells the story of Mad Sweeney, a king
who is changed into a bird at the battleof Moiraand exiled to
the trees and rolling hills of pastoral Ireland by the curse of a
holy cleric. Heaney's poem can be read as representing the
dynamic struggle between the spirit ofcreative imagination
and the constaints of religious, political, and domestic obligation.
After spending time lamenting his condition, Sweeney
journeys through the countryside, having symbolic confrontations between his transformed state and aspects of his
former life. In skittish flights from people and memoriesof his
former life, he stops at churches, visits his wife, and confronts
warriors and subjects who remind him ofhis former glory and
political might. Sweeney rejects all of them with liberating
narratives which speak the once tethered spirit which now
soars freely andrelishes the transcendental beauty of nature.
He encounters his wife just after she has seen her lover
and remarks: "I go to earth/ in panic, starved and bare,/ a rickle
of skin and bones./1 am yours no longer./ And you are another
man's." He severs other ties when at a church, Sweeney
compares nature's consummate beauty to that which seems
manufactured in religion: "I perched for rest and imagined/
cuckoos calling across watery theBann cuckoo, calling sweeter/
than church bells that whinge and grind."
Finally, when haunted by the belligerent cries of warriors, he remembers his hardships, attacks the enanglements
ofpolitical life, andpraises allof the trees ofIreland. His body
and spirit rise above the tree tops and he looks down with an

expanded perspective, comparing the soothing beauty of
nature to the sharp rift created by the violence endemic in the
nature of 15th-century politics. Passages which praise nature
"The alder in my darling,/ all thornless in the gap,/some milk
ofhumankindess/ coursing in its sap," contrast others which
highlight violence: "Drawand quarter, pike and spit him, none
will blame you." Sweeney's spirit, lifted by robust gales of an
internal creative force, takes flight: "my wild career/ as the
wolffrom the wood/goes tearing ahead/ and I lift towards the
mountain./ thebark of foxes/ echoing below me,/ the wolves
behind me/howling and rending-/ their vapory tongues,/ their
low-slung-speed/ shaken off like nightmare/ at thefoot of the
slope."
Heaney identifies with Sweeney's struggle as both an
artist and an Irish native. Sweeney's flights above the vast and
wild beauty of Irish countryside actually traverse Heaney's
birthplace. In acknowledgement of theseconnections, Heaney
remarks that Sweeney "seemed to have been with me from the
start." Heaney captures in words what Rachel Brown's pictures depicted visually- that is, the ineffable beauty of the
countryside which parallels the awesome internal beauty
Sweeney finds in nature and his creative spirit. One does not
need to be a native ofIreland, though, to appreciate Sweeney's
narratives. They call to one's desire to throw off constraints
and binding obligations in order to free one's creative spirit.
Especially at Swarthmore, where long hours in the library
swallowed by class work are contrasted with the fantastic
beauty of our campus, one feels torn between the focused
ideologies of academic learning and theabstract yet intriguing
undercurrent ofindividual expression which exists in every-

-

one.

At McCabe, Brown's photographs stared out from the
walls beckoning to the spirit's eye like benevolent Sirens, yet
were passed over in the rush to finish on-line searches or
problem sets. Heavy academic work often seems to dull the
imagination, rather than makeit more sensitive, and one finds
it difficult to reconcile learning with innate creativity. Sharp
distinctions are made betweenclass learning and imaginative

two worlds, yearning for the benefits of both, yet struggling to
find where the two meet. Ideally the two should meet, and
imagination becomes a catalyst for assimilating knowledge
and ideas into individual expression.
This will not change the potency and appeal ofpoems like
"Sweeney Astray," or Rachel Brown's photographs. They
will continue to beckon to our creative spirit, and some will
ride wild and fantastic journeys on their force, wishing for
what Heaney describes as a place "Where springs not fail,/To

ist liberal view. He took Jesus' word as rendered in the Bible as (gospel) truth, however,
and was emphatic about the huge effect doing
the play had had on his life.
Kuhn has been doing the show for ten
years on and off with the Actors' Theater of
Louisville. Kentucky, however, is not the
closest Kuhn has come to Broadway. He
played Les Miserable's Montparnasse (and
did an understudy of Javert) on Broadway,
and later joined the National Tour of the
Broadway musical Chess. Although his in-

volvement in theaterhas been very extensive,
he saidofLuke, "This is the most demanding,
fulfilling theater I've ever done."
Considering his on-stage task is to perform a Gospel (well, 60% of a Gospel actually) from the King James version of the
Bible, it's easy to believe his claim. To his
credit, his style is so modern and informal that
one hardly notices the "thee"'s, "thou*"s and
"spake"'s that are abundant in theKing James.
While appreciation of his theatrical style is
not a taste that I have acquired, Kuhn masterfully accomplished what he had set out to
accomplish—a rendering ofLuke that was
both entertaining and reverent.

BLAM!

The Good, the Bad, and the
Anonymous
In the past few weeks, several anonymous letters have appeared on the pages of
The Phoenix, one of which has stirred up
quite a bit of controversy. In response to
concerns raised by some members of the
student body and administration, I would
like to address some of the matters which
have been brought to my attention during
the past week.
Concerns about The Phoenix's anonymous letter policy have been of both specific and general natures, and I would like
to address the specific first The offending
letter, which appeared on page four of the
February 19, 1993 issue of The Phoenix,
criticized a story written in an earlier issue
about an incidentwhich occurred in Willets.
This letter incited two responses this week,
each raising issues of difference with the
anonymous letter's content. One of the
letters specifically accused 77ie Phoenix for
allowing factual inaccuracies to occur in
the letter. I admit that the letter did contain
statements that were factually untrue, and
as such, should not havebeen printed. Ithas
been pointed out that such an oversight can
result in harmful effects (as shown by the
author of this week's response); I do not,
however, believe that this alone is reason
enough to do away with the anonymous
letter policy.
To citePhoenix policy, I would like to
point out that no letter appearing in this
paper is entirely anonymous. Rather, the
writer has submitted an article with his or
her name (to any member of the editorial
staff), and has simply requested that the
name be withheld in printing.
While some will disagree with me, I
believe that the "anonymous" option for
opinion writers is a valuable one, and can

ultimately add to the diversity of opinions
found in The Phoenix. Despite the common
belief of complete tolerance on this campus, many opinions and views are not accepted with the open mindedness that many
tout. Certain "extremist" views are not
exactly accepted with open arms here at
Swarthmore— sometimes for good reasons; that does not mean, however, that
they shouldn't be heard. I believe that The
Phoenix, being the only newspaper on this
campus, should be open to all opinions, be
they popular or not If the author feels
comfortable in signing his or her name,
then so be it. But if he or she is afraid of
inciting the wrath and hatred of hall-mates,
professors, the dining service or Al Bloom,
then the author should have the freedom to
print their opinions with name withheld.
This, of course, does not excuse the
practice of hiding behind the shelter of
anonymity to put forward mistruths—whether or not these mistruths are intentional—and I takeresponsibility for allowing last week's writer to misrepresent the
truth under the protection of anonymity. I
also thank the authorofthis week's letterfor
bringing this inaccuracy to light
I assure the readers of The Phoenix that
in the future, all opinion articles, anonymous ones in particular, will be more closely
examined so as to ensure that damaging
factual misrepresentations will not slip
through. I hope that my explanation of this
policy has helped to show therole ofanonymous letters in The Phoenix. If you still
don't agree, you can always write a letter
telling what you think about me and my
asinine policies; it can even beanonymous.

Middle East Conference
Fails to Represent all Views
Colorado Swattie Speaks
Out On Amendment Two
by RAM LEE
In order for the controversial Amendment 2 to
pass in Colorado it took millions of votes. People
need to realize that most of the people who voted
for it were not bigots orgay-haters. Also, it wasn't
a momentary lapse of reason on the part of Colorado voters: the Denver Post reported two months
after the vote that 94% percent ofrespondents from
a state-wide telephone poll said that they would
vote the same as they did on Nov. 3.
Colorado does not have a history as a ridiculously conservative state: Jerry Brown won our
primary, we've had a democrat for governor since
1972, Colorado was one of the strongest supporters
for Perot, we repealed sodomy laws over twenty
years ago, etc. Why then did Amendment 2 pass?
Amendment 2 was a proposed amendment to
the Colorado state constitution that would take the
language of "sexual orientation/sexualpreference"
out of all discrimination and affirmative action
laws. Only Denver, Boulder, and Gilpin counties
(three large counties) had affirmative action laws.
Aspen also has some form of affirmative action.
Many of Amendment 2's supporters called
the measure an end to "special rights for gays." As
far as I understand, however, the law makes it legal
to discriminate against gays claiming their sexual
orientation as the criteria, as well as striking down
current affirmative action laws.
Most of the people who I talked with over
Christmas break who voted for Amendment 2 gave
some of the following reasons:
They were concerned about the "special rights
legislation" that they feared was spreading. They
viewed Amendment 2 as the way to roll back the
furthering of gay special rights. They felt that gays
were not a group that needed to be specially singled

out for protection. Gays in Denver live in the nicer
neighborhoods and have a median income that is
twice the state average; didn't seem like gays
needed economic protection and it was so hard to

enforce.

Enforcement is an issue that many propoas swaying their vote. Also, some

nents cited

minority leaders (I know only of the Black student
leadersat the University of Colorado) were in favor
of Amendment 2 because they felt that anyone
could say that they were gay (perhaps a celibate
gay, even) and it couldn't be proven. They feared
a business entirely composed of white gay males
which met a minority quota. Also, race, gender,
and age are all attributes that are verifiable and
irrevocable from birth. Many believe that people
are also born homosexual, however, and as such
objected to this line of argument.
The question of whether homosexuality is
decided before birth or is a conscious choice looms
large in this debate. Whatever you think, the reality
is this: NO ONE KNOWS. Many liberals assume
that considering homosexuality as genetic (or in
some other way not a choice) is somehow a better
answer that should be used in place of scientific
evidence. Some supported Amendment 2 as a way
to allow each person to decide for him/herself this
issue; the government would not make a standard,
but leave it up to individuals to determine if homosexuality is a choice.
Under Amendment 2, if an employer feels
uncomfortable around gays then he has the right to
not hire them. Some say that this can be likened to
the struggle for black civil rights (many employers
then said the same about blacks as currently is said
of gays) and should be dealt with in the same way.
The question of choice rears its head here again.

Dear Editor:
Last Saturday, February 20,1 attended a conference at Swarthmore College sponsored by
theDelaware Committeefor Peace and Justice in the Middle East. Perhaps a college campus
was not the best location for this event. I was distressed to find that while there were many
different speakers talking about diverse subjects, they all came from a similar ideological
framework. I wonder how much good a conference like this achieves? It seemed to me to be
a very fast way of breaking down bridges. This conference did not bring people together, it
polarized them How beneficial is this?
Maybe the point of this conference was not to accelerate understanding, but it was
designed to discuss many different issues from one perspective. Still, what does this
accomplish? I have seldomfelt so much anti-Jewish hostility. In fairness, however, this came
the community members in the audience, and neither from the speakers nor the students
present.
Still I suppose I expected more from the organizers of this event. Perhaps they should have
anticipated this hostility and sought to break it down. Perhaps they shouldhave anticipated this
hostility and sought to break it down. Perhaps I am expecting too much. Towards theend one
professor expressed the hope that this event would continue next year at Haverford College.
Unless this conference is fully restructured to be sensitive to the opinions of many different
people, I sincerely hope this would not occur.
Thank you for listening. B'shalom,

This Amendment allows employers to discriminate against their employee based on their
employee's private life. There is much disagreement with this principle. Many legislators support
a so called "Jelly Roll Bill" which says that an
employee cannot be fired for engaging in any legal
activity (sodomy is legal in Colorado) away from
the work site (such as eating a jelly roll). I,
however, do not subscribe to this doctrine. Should
I ever own a business, I would want to be able to
hire and fire based on how they conducted their
private life. If they are a drunk who refuses help,
even if it doesn'taffect their job performance, then
I would fire them.
Ross Perot, believing that one's private life
invariably affects business, crossed this line with
the following tow rule for employees of formerly
his EDS, Inc.: employees could not wear facial hair
(unprofessional presentation) and extra-marital
affairs were grounds for dismissal (he figured that
'if your wife, who you publicly vowed to honor,
can't trust you
what makes us think we can).
There are those who believe that Amendment
2 violates the Colorado State Constitution. Now

here is where the debate loses two viable sides. An
amendment to a constitution inherently cannot
violate that constitution; an amendment is, in fact,
a reinterpretation of the constitution, establishing
the precepts of said amendment into the way that
constitution is interpreted. It is ridiculous that
Amendment 2 has been put on hold by the courts.
Even the Colorado Attorney General's office, which
was generally in opposition to the measure, cedes
that is inherently constitutional (with the state,
perhaps not with the federal constitution). Constitutionality should not be in question, which sadly
does not keep Amendment 2 from being tied up in
the courts who have kept it from going into effect
The questions are: are homosexuals in need
of an economic boost? Is it enforceable (enforceability to be weighed against need for discrimination protection)? Is homosexuality a choice? Who
should decide the previous question? Can an
employer exercise discrimination with regard to an
employeesprivate life?
The answers are: no, no, yes, me, and yes.
The point is: the government is unqualified and
unable to address and enforce this issue.

Social Justice
or Social
Revenge?

United States Not Obligated to Intervene
By LIGEIA JENNIS

Deep Thoughts
by NOAH B. SALAMON
Recently, an advertisement has been passed

around Swarthmore campus, in the hopes ofsoliciting reactions and commentary from students
and faculty. People are asked, "Is the advertisement offensive? Effective?" It seems that
Swarthmore's well-known sensitivity to race,
gender, and class issues has become something of
a commodity to the advertising industry, which
stands accused of perpetuating stereotypes and
other injustices in their advertising.
The advertisement portrays a pale white
skeleton wearing a cowboy hat and a vest, holding
up a lighter toa cigarette that danglesprecariously
from the innocent mouth of a young AfricanAmerican child The boy seems naive, impres-

sionable, even martyred. Ifmemoryservesme.a
text reads, "They used to want us to pick it Now
they want us to smoke it" The two stand against
the backdrop ofrows ofidentical graves, suggest-

ing the factory-like production of death.
I was not asked to comment on this advertisement, perhaps because when the woman conducting the survey stated that she wanted input
from manydifferent ethnicities, she was implying
that she had enough input from whites. I thought
she was entirely professional, and I think that the
policy of soliciting opinions from a wide range of
sources is perfectly sound, even advisable. Moreover, I am sympathetic with the campaign to
expose the dangers of smoking, and tocorrect the
nefarious practices of the advertising industry in
targeting certain groups/areas and promoting certain stereotypes.
Nevertheless, I wanted to express my reservations about this ad. It is perhaps one of the most
regrettable features ofreform movements by oppressed groups that they tend to learn the tactics of
the oppressor too well, and to forget to unlearn
them. The ad seems to profit by the very strategy
it seeks to undermine: 'they' (tobacco companies? whites? cowboys?) are murdering 'us'
(African-Americans). In the process of exhibiting what is unmistakably a caricature of the "devil
white man" (i.e. the 'they* cannot refer solely to
tobacco companies or cowboys, but fits more
nicely as a referent to whites in general) the
advertisementitselfpromotes stereotypes, targets
a community, and promotes dissension. What is
the difference between this ad and the disparaging
caricatures perpetrated by the advertising industry in the past except that it takes different sides?
In any context, an advertisement that poses
an innocent, oppressed, and good 'us' against an
inhuman, monstrous, and unqualifiedly evil' them'
is dangerous. Against the backdrop of American
race relations and their abysmal past and present,
it isreckless. It is one difference between justice
and revenge that justice seeks right and peace
while revenge simply wants the tables turned.
The discussion of this advertisement's viability
seems to pose a deeper question: whether the
movement for exposing and eradicating racism is
to be a movement of social justice or a movement
of social revenge.
Thanks to my Jewish upbringing, I know
this struggle only too well. There are, after all,
still those who will not buy German products,
who harbor a secret (or not too secret) hatred for
things and people from Germany, who secredy
thrill to hear of German failure and tragedy. With
my many years of Hebrew School screenings of
holocaust movies, my trip to Yad Vashem (the
holocaust memorial in Jerusalem) and the recent
neo-Nazirevival in Germany, the struggle against
this attitude is one of the perennial struggles that
constantly engages my capacity for mercy and
justice against my strong temper and sense of
revenge. But I have never forgotten on what side
are mercy and justice, and on what side temper
and revenge.
So, perhaps I am too ready to let the advertisement resonate with the dehumanization of a
class ofpeople, too ready to cry wolf. Butitseems
important toraise the issue here, that the advertisement is subtly manipulative, that it unleashes
the very weapons ofintolerance and racism that it
pretends to undermine, and that I found it, on
reflection, to pose what is to me the crucial question for the movement

have learned. But what are the results of
thinking globally? Thinking globally to most
Americans means thinking of how to go in and
fix other people's problems. It means being
the proud police officer. But then we put on
our uniforms and wave around our sticks, be
they large or small, and we realize that it isn't
as easy as it should have been. And our boys
and girls, who went away as noble officers of
truth and freedom, come back as corpses and
trauma cases. Now in truth, thinking globally,
our boys and girls are no more valuable than
the Bosnian boys and girls, who are no more
valuable than the Somalian boys and girls. I
can realize that logically. But to me, being
selfish and illogical and nationalistic, my
people are more important. And I don't want
to waste their lives. I don't wantto see them
return disfiguredmentally and physically from
horror after horror but finally from the realization of their own futility.
And this is why we are not OBLIGATED
to enter theformer Yugoslavia. The U.S. has
an obligation to itself, the obligation to survive and to protect its own people. If we
understood the situation the answer might be
differentbut that isn't the case here. The only
thing we seem to understand is that the situation is messy and dangerous and holds no
promise of any sort of satisfactory ending. I
don't want to sacrifice my brothers and sister,
not even for my foreign cousins, not when the
only thing I can offer either is uncertainty.
There is a sort of honor to be found in
accepting limitations, if those limitations are
realistic. At least there is an honesty to it I
know something has to be done. I just don't
think that putting on the old police uniform is
the right answer for now.

all of the speeches and articles: the U.S. is

If the audience can recall, our first
issue promised that this article would be
devoted to Somalia and would then be
followed by next week's discussion of the
situation in former Yugoslavia. After a bit
of discussion, it was decided that the two
situations were so remarkably similarthat
one week could be used instead of two.
These are the grounds for that decision.
First, in both instances the U.N. and U.S.
were invited in—begged for help, actually. And, as a corollary to this, each time
it appeared that the requested aid would
not be forthcoming, racism was claimed
as the real reason. Second, the level and
type of destruction is the same. In both
cases starvation is imminent and widespread. In both cases innocent civilians
are in equal, or perhaps even more, danger
than the soldiers who one would expect to
bear the brunt of the war. Finally, and this
could probably be said of all wars, the
situations inboth cases are incredibly complex. Simply admitted, the U.S. and U.N.
wouldbe involved in a long, complicated,
very tense job upon entering into either
fray. The rights of any one faction above
the others are tenuous at best
Why hasn't the U.S. entered the
former Yugoslavia with a defensive as it
has done in Somalia? Should it do so to
relieve the undeniable suffering and end
the senseless bloodshed? These are the
obvious questions. If the situations are so
similar and so inarguably bad, aren't we,
as both AMERICANS and ethicalpeople,
obligated to act? That is the implication in

obligated to act as a police officer when it
witnesses undeniable crimes.
Well, I don'tthink we are obligated to
act. It goes against every lesson I received in
elementary school and will probably make
my parents cringe, but I don't think we have
to end every evil. Not personally and not all
alone simply because it is the common perception that we can. If asked I'd say it is apart
of the new burgeoning world order. Ending
the monopoly of the superpowers also meant
being deprived of the very parental aspectsof
having super powers watching over the world.
Former children must now mature and deal
with their own sovereignty issues. And truthfully, they are the only ones equipped to do
so, the only ones whoreally understand what
is at stake. The police officer can only do so
much. It is now time for the community, here
the former Balkan nations, to stand an act.
But they can't do it any longer. They've
been decimated. I wish I knew what to say to
that because it is true. Something has to be
done to help. I just don' t bel ieve that the U.S.
has to be the aide or that the help has to be
military. I don't thinkit is our obligation and
I do not believe itis our best option. Not if we
wantto decrease the military. Not if we want
to focus on our internal problems, of which
we have plenty. Not if we wantto accept the
new world order.
This is an isolationist's argument I
realize thatmuch. Furthermore, blind isolationism has led to some of the worst international debacles inhistory. Some might argue
that, if nothing else, history should have
taught us to think globally or to not bother
thinking at all. Thatis certainly the lesson we

Inaction Has Never Stopped Injustice
By KAR-YEE WU
If you have

not

read Ms. Jennis's

article, I suggest that you do so. The three
points that she assumes about Somalia and
former Yugoslavia create the background
to my argument. We chose these two
arenas to focus our arguments, but I believe that our arguments could apply to
questions of intervention in any part of the
world, including within the U.S. While
she argues that we are not obligated to act
to end the devastation in Somalia and
former Yugoslavia, I intend to argue the

direct opposite; we have an obligation as
a part of humanity to end the injustice and
cruelty perpetrated daily in these areas.
Where does this obligation come
from? Why should we intervene in either
area? Wouldn't we be infringing upon
their sovereign rights? Why should we
care about a bunch of people half a world
away when we have our own problems
back home? Why should we risk the lives
ofour own people for complete strangers?
These are not easy questions to answer,
but I will do my best to answer them.
I will leave the question of sovereign
rights to a later article. They deserve a
closer consideration than what I can provide here. As to why we should intervene
andall the other questions, the answers are
not so simple, but certainly more charged.
Before I go further, I should explore the
question of who should be the agent of
action. In this and other articles, I have
argued that the agent of actionis the nation
as a whole. Here, I believe the same. The
nation must act because the individuals
living within the nation are obligated to
act. A nation can wield more power than

individuals and so more to effect lasting
change. What applies to the individual applies to the nation comprised of such individuals and in this case, vice versa.
Therefore, the simplest answer I can
give is we must act if we believe ourselves to
be ethical and moral people. If something
fundamentally offends our morality, as I believe the situations in Somalia and former
Yugoslavia do, then we are obligated to act
upon that morality if we are to maintain it. If
we do not, we threaten to erode away our
morality and I believe our humanity. To
quote Martin Luther King, Jr., "Injustice
anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."
If we tolerate injustice simply because it does
not directly affect us and is therefore not our
problem, then the devastation will claim more
than human lives; it will claim our compassion and our basic humanity. Standing by
idly has never stopped injustice; the Holocaust vividly teaches us this lesson. Only
action can stop injustice from flourishing.
Someone could say this is all very well
and good, but why should we care about
those outside our own little world? Why
should we risk our people for theirs? The
answer is simple. Those who suffer half the
world away are not strangers; they are the
same as us, if not, in fact, actually us. To
borrow from Shakespeare and his famous
stranger, Shylock, we all feel the same emotions, are hurt by the same things, and are far
more alike than we think. To deny these facts
would be to deny that the sky is blue. We may
risk our people to save others, but in doing so
we can only save ourselves. Admittedly
intentions are not morality; theroad to hellis
paved with good intentions. However, which
is the greater sin: to watch someone die
because you were afraid to act or to act and

perhaps risk your own life and through acting
save another?
One could question how certain can we
be of the outcome of our actions. Ms. Jennis
argues well that we should not risk the lives of
our own for an uncertain outcome. Restated,
her question is if we cannot change the situation, should we pour good lives into a seemingly futile quest? It would seem that both she
and Vietnam teach us this lesson (yes, once
again, I manage to bring that one in). Inaction
appears to be the proper way to go;
obligation is lost

our

I question that whole premise. Since
when was anyone certain about the outcome

v

of anything? The unpredictable permeates
our lives; ask any good statistician or physicist Uncertainty should not preclude action;
if that was always the case, nothing would
ever get done. As a good friend of mine
recently said, failure is theresult of too narrow
a time-frame. Will the sacrifice of lives now
be worth the gain in lives later? I would say
yes. The question is not are you willing to live
with the consequences if you do act, but can
you live with the consequences if you do not?
To me, the greater dishonesty is tonot act and
to not attempt good when one has the power to
do so (are you listening, Mr. President and Mr.
Secretary-General?).
I leave you with this final thought about
why the U.S. or an individual should act
Would anyone hesitate to help a family member, even risk her life to do so? No? Then
consider those in Somalia and former Yugoslavia to be part of our family. It might sound
a little too new-age flaky, but until we understand and recognize the common humanity
that binds us together, the violence will never
stop. It is so much easier to kill an "it" than a

"you"

Freshman Disappointed with "Anonymous"
To the Editor:
I am writing to convey my disappointment at The Phoenix's
policy of printing anonymous letters and editorials, of which there
were two in last week's edition, and to respond to one of them. I feel
that printing anonymous letters is a great error on the part of the
editorial board— if someone had something meaningful to say, they
ought to sign their name on it, and if they are ashamed to say it or
won't take responsibility for what they say, they should (with very
few exceptions) keep their pen capped. (The Phoenix at any rate
should feel no obligation to print such letters.) I am especially
distressed at the attack on Natasha Franceschi's article regarding the
Willets incident of a few weeks ago. ThePhoenix should not be in
the business of printing such attacks— on their own reporter, no
less— by someone who refuses to be identified. I would hope that
you soon institute a policy requiring all future letters and editorials
to be signed.
Now to the letter

itself: Mr. or Mrs. Anonymous is full of
something unprintable. The impairment of alcohol of the accusing

female's mind is entirely irrelevant to the criminality of the male's
actions. It doesn't matter how drunk the woman is; she can even
consent to sex while fully intoxicated, but if she's not in full control
ofher faculties then it's rape just as if she were sober and said "no."
Assaulting and harassing an intoxicated woman, as the University
of Delaware student was accused of doing, is no less criminal than
doing the same to someone who is notunder theinfluence. And with
regard to Anonymous' statement aboutThePhoenix's article leading
to "unfair prejudices against... all men on campus," I'm at a loss as
to whatkind of prejudices s/he is referring to. Am I supposed to feel
marginalized or oppressed in some way because a young man was
arrested for assaulting a woman? The only oppression I feel comes
from being part of a society in which women are assaulted and
harassed every day and yet anonymous cretins cry "injustice" at
reports that don't imply the victim might be to blame.
Sincerely,
JUSTIN PAULSON *96

Fulani in Need
of Reality Check

Lenora Fulani, the 1988 and 1992presidential candidate
spoke at the PAC on Monday the 15th and made some strong
points about third party politics, but she also made many
comments that are simply absurd. Her strong points about
third party politics should not be viewed as anything original
or worthy of praise. In both elections Fulani received less than
one-fourth of one percent of the total vote cast. She ran as a
candidate of the New Alliance Party, a party that thrives on
deception and warped social theories.
The party is one that is truly deserving ofspecial mention.
It was founded by Fred Newman, a former member ofLyndon
Laßouche's conspiracy-obsessed party. Newman holds a
psychological theory mat every person is dominated by a
"dictatorship of the bourgeois ego" that must be overthrown
in a personal revolution to liberatetheproletarian ego. Newman
is able to preach his views through his fifteen therapy centers.
These therapy centers, which treat many Medicaid and Medicare patients, stress the social origins of emotional illness. A
substantial number of the former patients of these centers join
Newman's party after the completion of their treatment. An
interesting note is that much of the profits from these treatment centers is funneled in to the party —a party whose leader
has called Jews "the stormtroopers of decadent capitalism"
and says that Jews have "sold their souls to the devil
international capitalism".
The comments that I found especially interesting dealt
with the present system of race relations and the system of
justice. Fulani proffers many harshcriticisms of our society,
but offers no real solutions. When she spoke of the rioting that
plagued Los Angeles after thedeliveranceof the Rodney King
verdict, she said that none of the blacks involved in the
violence or rioting should have been arrested. She also said
-

that" Blaming the blackresponse to the Rodney King decision
is like blaming the Jews for fighting back in Nazi Germany".
She went on further to say that no one should have been
arrested for the beating of Mr. Denny, the white truck driver,
by blacks protesting the verdict. She justified this by saying
that Denny was beaten for what he represents
the white
race. I truly hope that our legal system does not embrace this
idea
that a guilty party can escape punishment on the
grounds of what the injured person represents. Forgetting
about her comparison of the King decision to the German
Holocaust, isn't it ludicrous to suggest that some types of
violence and law-breaking behavior are allowable?
Fulani also spoke despairingly of the "racist media" in
this country and claims that "Rodney King was the rule, not
the exception". She feels that the media is biased against
blacks and other minorities. In reality, though, the media was
more sympathetic to Rodney King than the police officers.
None ofthe networks showed the Rodney King video that was
filmed by GeorgeHoliday in its entirety. The networks did not
display King resisting the officers and continuing to come
after the officers after he was shot with a stun gun. The reason
for this is that the media likes to sensationalizeall events. In
addition, it enabled them to portray this event as a black and
white issue, whichis exactly what it was not. The officers did
not use force against King because he is black, but rather,
because he was intoxicated and resisting arrest. King's
attempt to attack the police further after being shot with the
stun gun illustrates the fact that he was severely intoxicated
and that his actions could not be predicted. Many Americans
protested against the decision, but the jurors came to their
decision because they believed that there was reasonable
doubt, not because Rodney King is black.

During Fulani's speech she frequently mentioned the
historical significance of the 1992 election
an election in
which third party candidates received twenty percent of the
vote. There is no problem with third party candidates receiving votes, but this was not necessarily a revolutionary event in
third party politics. It is true that third party candidates
received twenty percent of the vote, but one candidate received nineteen of the twenty percent. The 1992 election is
not significant because many thirdparties received substantial
portions of the vote, but rather it is because Perot was able to
secure the large portion of the vote as a third party candidate.
Fulani noted that the way in which our electoral system
is working is undemocratic, and she presented ideas that were
introduced many decades ago. Voter registration and voting
is an area that she particularly detests on the grounds that it is
to difficult to register to vote and that one day for voting is
simply not enough. Criticisms of this type have been levied
sincethe time ofRoosevelt and yet she tries to present this as
a new idea. She mentioned that some European countrieshave
voting periods ofup to one week and saidthat we should adopt
a similar system in this country. The obvious problem with
that is the press. In this country with the frequency of voter
exit polls the outcome would be known throughout the nation
days before the finish of the voting. A week-long voting
period would not result in more voter participation because
what is the need to vote in an election if the winner has already
been determined. These suggestions shouldnot be viewed as
anything new or revolutionary.
Deagogues like Fulani should stop pandering to popular
prejudices and making false claims. It is time for her to stop
complaining about the system and it is time for her to try
achieving her goals by working within the system.

Love for Lisa: The Sweet Blossoming of a Friendship
■I

m

Take Two

by LISA STEFANOWICH
Ah, February! A time of excitement
and love. Eyes glisten at the thought of the
coming spring, and romance floats through
the air like cheap drugstore perfume.
Valentine's Day brings sentiment in theform
of Hallmark couplets and cinnamon hearts.
Screw Your Roommate allows a few meaningful hours with your roommate's lab
partner's hall-mate while grooving on a beersoaked wooden floor. In short, the pure
emotion of February is inescapable.
Even I, cynic that I am, succumbed to the
lure of February's siren song this year. I
out my markers to make valentines
for my friends. I bought carnations from my
local lacrosse representative. I was ceremoniously screwed in that very shrine of love,
Sharpies dining hall. I can even admit that I
had fun. Really, though, all this sappy hogwash is superfluous. You see, I have a lover.
The word "lover," according to
Stefanowich's First Dictionary ofPurely Inane
and Non-Standard Usage, is defined as "the
victim of a strictly platonic relationship in
which said party is teased and harassed by a
short Polish woman." It's nothing illicit, and
11 s much more interesting than it may sound.
I had my first lover at the tender age of
stxteen. Ron sat next to me in desk-top

*nd Bass Masters. Admittedly, he was no
Cyrano de Bergerac, but he had a certain

boyish charm. Thereal clincher, though, was
his skill at importing graphics. One look at
the way he double-clicked a mouse and I was
hooked.
Since I was a worldly junior and he was
a measly sophomore, I felt perfectly justified
in informinghim that, like it or not, he was my
lover. I waved at him in the halls. I cooed at
him in a deliberately syrupy falsetto. In class,
I gazed at him over my keyboard, batted my
eyes and said, "Youknow what, Ron? You're
my lover."
Ron's reaction to my shenanigans was
impressive, to say the least. At first he would
just avert his eyes and mumble when I addressed him. Later he would speed up when
he saw me approaching in the halls. Soon I
noticed a distinctiveshudder when I smiled at
him. His dramatics were better than I had ever
expected.
Still, all good things must end. The
following fall, when I started my senioryear,
I realized I had outgrown Ron. This dreadful
revelation came the day I saw him being
pulled over by a teacher for hoofing fullspeed toward the cafeteria. I knew I could
never have a lover who was told to "Getback
there and walk it, buster."
Ron was soon replaced by Matt, a freshman
excuse me, I mean "ninth-year student"
who was in theater with me. Matt
was a dancer, the real kind that knows lots of
fancy French wordsfor "jump. "He had shiny
black hair, the purest white skin, and weighed
allof ninety-three pounds. Healso did a great
Pillsbury Doughboy impersonation.
I decided upon a slight change of strategy withMatt. I didn't inform him he was my
lover. As a senior, I was far too mature to
annoy a random acquaintance with my silly
prattle; I prattled at my boyfriend instead.
"Matt is my lover" became my personal man-

tra, usually followed by an evil giggle.

My boyfriend handled my behavior as
gracefully as he could. He developed a slight
facial tic every time he heard the wordplii,
but since that was a fairly rare occurrence, it
wasn't noticed often.
My departure for college brought an end

concerns about a new school, a new roommate
yea, verily, a new life a lover was
far from my mind. Then one day during one
of those fun-time orientation discussion
groups, I found him...the man destined to be
my next lover.
Evan intrigued me. His quirks are small,
but numerous. He likes to climb trees. He
hangs fractals over his bed. He's from Idaho,
of all places. He was definitely a challenge
worth meeting.
At first, events unfolded as I expected
them to. When I informed him of his new
position, Evan displayed mild shock, the

proper reaction for new lovers. He showed a
healthily inquisitive attitude: why was he
chosen? what did this entail? I was sure that
he would be a perfect lover.
Soon, though, Evan'sbehavior surprised
me. He began greeting me with "Hi, lover."
He asked regularly, "How's my lover doing?"
It took me only a short time to realize he was
accepting his new role. He even seemed
heaven help me —to be enjoying it. I had
never been faced with a willing subject before. I was taken aback.
As I continued to pester Evan, and he
continued to put up withme, something strange
happened. Spending lots of time with someone who neither shudders nor runs nor develops funny facial tics is conducive to friendship. Soon we weren't just bantering, but
actually talking. When I was stressed, Evan
had a joke or a hug for me. When I felt the
need to procrastinate, Evan was usually willing to blow off work for some vital social
interaction. When the nearly inevitable firstyear long-distance breakup hit me, Evan was
there for me to cry on. Suddenly, I wasn't a
self-appointed tormentor, but a partner in
friendship. It blew my mind. It still does.
As the year progresses, I realize that the
annual cycle is rapidly winding down. Spring
will bring an end to the academic yearand my
third lover's term of duty. When autur
returns, it will be time to find a new lover,
perhaps some callow freshling who will be
properly shocked by my behavior.
Even though I know the cycle is
unstoppable and immutable, I'm a bit reluctant to give up my current lover. Evanhimself
seemed a bit hurt when I informed him he'll
be replaced. It's a shame; I genuinely like
him. He's been a great sport and a great
friend. Maybe, just maybe, I'll keep him
around.

James: Anyway, themovie is less politicized

acting talents, and less of a social statement.
I think he can do both, but since I'm more in

they're showing this movie.
Paul: If you need cheap thrills, you could

Rohit: You could try dipping.
James: It's mighty windy out there though.
Paul: I haven't seen this movie. I won't
comment. I'm just tired, please send me a

there hurling your guts out, my condolences.
James: I liked it, but I'd rather sleep right
now, too. Sorry we're lame, folks. Hope we
didn't prove Zengerle right.

Witch Hazel Blooms Early

Take the time to stop and sniff the flowers!

by REBECCA YAHM and
LISA MOSCA
Hello. Welcome to Swarthmore's very
own nature column (although this is its first
article and it doesn't even have a name yet so
you can't really call it a column, but...). To
start off we wanted to let you know about
some of the vegetative color on campus, stuff
that you can see right now if it's not covered
by the snow.
You've probably noticed some of those
nifty yellow flowering things near Parrish
Annex. They're witch-hazel. Different varieties of witch-hazel bloom on campus from
November to March, and they have different
colors and fragrances. The most recent batch
is the yellow Chinese witch-hazel, which you
can see out there now. This very moment, as
you read this, the petals could be rolling up if
it is cold out, something they have a tendency
to do (something you might want to do, too).
The flowers are probably pollinated by
the wind, which makes sense, because there's
not much out there right now as far as other
pollinators go (bees, for instance). The plants
are "perfect" which means they have both
male and femaleflowers on one plant. Induction or beginning offlowering in many plants
is effected by a critical night period (maybe
you are too), and the witch-hazel plants are
probably flowering now because they have
had the necessary exposure to darkness (either in one night or over time, depending on
how flowering in witch-hazel is induced).
Now if you look more closely at witchhazel after reading this article (we figure if
we've got you this far, we have you for the
duration), you'll notice that the seed pods
from last year are still on the plant, because
the seed capsules stick around even after
they've dispersed their seeds in the late summer and early fall. Witch-hazel plants have an
ingenuous (and really neat) dispersal mechanism which catapults the seeds awayfrom the
plant, and ithas probably stuckaround through

evolution because it's good at getting the
seeds far away from the plant. If you squeeze
the seed capsules while the seeds are stiL
there, you can cause the projectile mechanisn
to spew out the seeds (something to think
about next fall when you're getting reall)
bored sitting around the corner in Parlors).
"So, what are some other neat facts aboul
witch-hazel?" you might wonder... (or not,
but we'll tell you anyway). Witch-hazel is z
medicinal plant used for a variety ofpurposes,
You can make it into teas that are used as a
remedy for colds and sore throats. It can be
used externally as a remedy for sore muscles
and bruises, for minor skin irritation, eye
ailments, etc. Pretty cool plant, huh?
Anyway, if witch-hazel in bloom isn'l
enough for you, a few other plants that are
early signs of spring include theLenten roses
in bloom outside of the PAC and around the
side of Martin, where the Arboretum has
planted a winter garden. Croci are blooming
on CedarLane near the BCC on sunny days,
and there's some winter aconite (small yellow
flowers) blooming in the winter garden, too.
If you need a break from cramming for those
midterms, go on a walk and see how many
different colors you can see as the spring
flowers begin to bloom.
And if reading this interesting and informative (we hope)piece about witch-hazel has
prompted a million questions about other
non-human things that live around this campus, we would love to hear them so we can
find out all kinds ofstuffabout themand write
it in The Phoenix. In addition, if you happen
to know any really exciting facts aboutany of
the plants and animals that dwell on this
campus, and you are dying to share them with
other Phoenix-readers, let usknow about that
too (college mail, e-mail, etc.). We hope you
get some time to lookaround at spring coming
even as the workloadpiles up (maybe on your
way to Beardsley). Don't forget to sniff the
witch-hazel, and if you think of a great name
for our column....

Exceptional Play Breaks Rules of Traditional Theatre
by STACY NAKELL

A small, cozy room in the

Women's Center. Twenty-five au-

dience members sitting on either
side of the center stage. Six actors:
John Byhouwer '93, Quinn
Bauriedel '94, Nathaniel Read '95,
Micheline Murphy '93, Sanda
Balaban '94, and Krister Johnson
'95 taking turnsbeing people, noises,
dust, mosquitoes,mirror images, and
narrators. Two plays framed by two
poems by Adrienne Rich. The
DramaBoard'sproduction ofBertolt
Brccht'sThe Exception andtheßule
and The Jewish Wife is unique and
riveting.
The production is the creation
of Dan Rothenberg '95, who was
intrigued by Brecht's plays and realized that the Rich poems could
form an appropriate framefor them.
He was thrilled to work withBrecht's
innovative techniques of evoking
audience participation and having
thecharacters come out of theirroles
to speak about themselves. These
ideas are experimented with in the
play since the audience is as involved as the spectators and one
audiencemember actuallybecomes
Byhouwer's lawyer. The audience
knows more than most of the characters about what is happening in
the play, and at various times,
Byhouwer, Bauriedel, and Read
throw themselves into analysis of
the motives of theircharacters.
In addition, Rothenberg wanted
to play with Brecht's use ofhumor
to get his point across. "A good
actor can come across the stage and
make us cry. A clown can come
across the stage and make us laugh,
and if he's a good clown, he'll make
us think about why we laughed and
why we cried."
The plays are introducedby an

innovativerendition of a portion of
Adrienne Rich's poem "An Adas of
The Difficult World." The six actors use their bodies and swift
changes ofcharacter to evoke Rich's
interpretation of different scenes
from around the world. A map of
the country turns to a sea ofindifference, Elvis becomes part of a machine gun, and the actors work together to evoke the falsity of
suburban life. The poem sets the
stage for the audience to open their
minds to the various issues involved
in the plays.
The Jewish Wife is a bold, onecharacter play, with Murphy as a
Jewish woman grappling with her
decision to leave her German husband to avoid the consequences
World War II is having on their
relationship. Murphy's character
goes through emotionalextremes of
polite normality, sadness, anger,bitterness, and love with only a telephone, an invisible husband, and
her reflection in themirror to reflect
her feelings. Her performance is
gripping, and the first play ends
leaving the audience tensely in contemplation of its implications.
The second play begins with
what seems to be simple, refreshing, comic relief as the three men
wait impatiently for the other hidden characters to get ready for an
excursion. Eventually all six heads
pop out in a vertical line-up, ready
for action, frombehind a door. The
comedy is sustained throughout the
play, as the characters makehilarious background noises (the highlight of which is a complete disruption ofwhateveraction is being performed at the mention of the Desert
Yahee while each character
screeches ya-HEEEEEE) and introduce strange characters such as a
red puppet (taken from Rothenberg's

Director Dan Rothenberg watches in amusement as Quinn Bauriedel, Nathaniel Read, and John
Byhouwer make their way to Urga.
home collection) into the scene. The
laughs continue when Read, who
portrays Coolie, performs a silly
song and footprint-wiping dance in
the desert. This humor was created
through a process of repeated
improvization by the various actors. Johnson describes this process: "We were given a theme,
desert, for example, and were told
to act out different elements of it,
the wind or the sand, to get a feel for
it."
The humor keeps the mood
light as the play introduces issues
which are fundamental and disturbing. The narrators urge us to question all that seems unexceptional,
and they present a story about class

differences and the futility ofmoral
behavior in a world which often
rewards immorality. The characters travel through dangerous situations in the hopes of arriving at the
final destination of Urga, to end up
finally only at a court which will
evaluate the tragedy of their trek.
Some scenes force the audience to
confront inhumanetreatment ofhumans, and many of Wednesday's
audience members flinched and
looked away at one of these, a beating of Coolie. The actors' impressive talents are exhibitedduring this
scene, as the disturbing beating actually only consists of Byhouwer's
hands clapping together.
The play ends with a final ex-

cerpt from Rich's poem, a conclusion which leaves the members of
the audience grappling with the
issues evoked as the actors gather
theirprops up andfinish the evening.
The first performance ended to

impressive applause. Rothenberg
enthustiatically commented that he
was "really happy" about the premierperformance. Balaban noticed
that the audience reacted well and
said that "there was good eye contact." As the cast shared its customary after-practice feast of Rolos,
they were already anxiously anticipating their next performance. The
plays are showing through Sunday,
and all are encouraged to make reservations for the limited seats.

Carolina's: Warmth, Happiness, and Great Food
The Roving
Gourmets
by DANIEL KAMIN and
SOPHIA LEE
Warmth, happiness, and great
food. This is what we and our
dinnermates found this past Friday
night at Carolina's, a restaurant just
off ofRittenhouse Square. We had
originally planned to dine at a different place, but were turned away:
"Sorry. No room tonight." It was a
good thing, however, because we
discovered oneof the most comfortable and delicious places we've been
to in a while.
Carolina's has no false pretenses, no airs of affluence or elitism. The atmosphere is lively and
relaxed—much like many Chinese
restaurants where families can be
loud as they enjoy their food. Although the familial atmosphere is
partially responsible for Carolina's
list ofregular customers, we found
that they offer an amazing variety of
mouth-watering fare at comparatively reasonable prices that could
entice people to return time and
again.
The menu varies daily and features an array of appetizers, soups,
salads, entrees, pasta, and sandwiches. Because of the worldly selection (a little heavy on the European), you can basically settle upon
whatever cuisine you feel like. If
you want Italian, there is Linguini
with Scallops or Tomato-SpinachGarlic Pizza. If you want Asian,
they haveChinese dumplings. Luck-

ily, with our numbers expanded to
four, we were able to sample a number of generally outstanding dishes.
We started out with bread and
two appetizers—baked brie coated
withOregon hazelnutsand a Middle
Eastern Trio. The oatmeal bread
itself was a hearty, lightly-sweet
multi-grain bread with a delectable
oatmeal crust. We found that it was
indispensable as we experienced
eachof appetizers. (In fact, our group
hadfinishedfive basketsworth!) Essentially, Carolina's won us over
with the first bite of semi-molten
cheese. First off, the dish was a
work of beauty
a golden wedge
ofbrie in a pool of strawberry puree
with several white water crackers
on the side. Our dinner partners
sampled the cheese, and, without
saying more than two words apiece,
they went on to consume about threequarters of the dish. (They barely
allowed us to sample theotherquarter.) The cheese was extraordinarily
smooth and rich. Combined with
the tantalizing hazelnuts on the crisp
outside, eating this piece of cheese
on top of crackers (and later, the
bread) was simply experiencing the
absolute height of culinary sensuality. Even if you don't like brie, you
and your dinner-matesMUST order
this. The expense (about six dollars)
is well worth the fleeting moments
of gastronomic heaven.
The Middle EasternTrio appetizer was fine, but next to the brie, it
was anticlimactic. It consisted of
triangles ofwarm zatarpita, a stockpile of black olive pieces, and three
baba ghanoush, hummus,
dips
and a lemon-yogurt mixture. The
hummus had a perfectly balanced

combination of lemon, garlic, and
tahina, and tiny pieces of chopped
garbanzo bean lent it an honest,
home-made appearanceand texture.
Although the baba ghanoush was
fresh, there was more than enough
garlic present to clear our sinuses
three times. However, this taste went

very well with the oatmeal bread.
The lemon-yogurt dip, on the other
hand, was thin and uninspiring. So,
basically, with swords of pita, we
cleared away the hummus, picked
at the baba ghanoush, and left the
yogurt alone.
A college-friendly aspect of
Carolina's is that one can choose
entrees that sound expensive, but
are actually below ten dollars. (Of
course, one can also choose entrees
that sound expensive and are more

than ten dollars.) For instance, you
can order a quality sandwich, complete with delicious hand-cut fries
and a pickle for about six or seven
dollars. We ordered the Smoked
Trout Sandwich, which featured a
tender, not-too-salty filet between
two hearty pieces of pumpernickel.
The fish had just theright amount of
smokiness, and combined with
home-prepared dill mayo and alfalfa sprouts, the sandwich craving
was more than satisfied.
The GriHed Scottish Salmon
was one of the best we'd ever had at
any restaurant. The fish was served
on a bed of sauteed spinach with
white corn and accompanied by several juicy strips offlavorful, succulent portobello mushrooms. Although the mushrooms complemented the salmon perfectly, the
spinach was a bit too soggy. The
fish itselfcould not havebeen grilled
more skillfully
the outside was
slightly crisp with light griddle
marks while the interior was entirely moist.
Our two companions each ordered pasta dishes. One ordered
linguini with scallops and the other
ordered saffron and beet fetuccine.
The scallops were very juicy and
melt-in your-mouth tender, while
the spinach pasta was el dente and
decorated with delicate shittake
mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes.
Our friendclaimedthat "it was most
satisfying" and that "they must have
had telepathic chefs" who were able
to know just what she wanted. The
fetuccine, according to our other
pasta-loving friend, was equally
well-prepared, and good enough to
elicit the highest compliment that

could be given a chef
long momentsofrapturous silence. Thepasta
was served in a light oil, parmesan,
and garlic sauce with perfectly
cooked vegetables. The fact that the
spices were not overpowering made
the experience even a greater treat
for him.
Our euphoria continued
through dessert and even through
the check with the help ofcheesecake, key-lime pie, and a brownie
sundae. The cheesecake was velvety-smooth, perfectly sweet, and
light enough to make the heavens
sigh. The rich brownie was served
piping hot, and topped with a huge
scoop ofluscious vanilla ice-cream
and warm, gloopy chocolate sauce.
This was definitely a sledgehammer dessert, fit for those in need of
intense amounts of chocolate and
oh, the
sugar. The key-lime pie
was spectacular. With its
pie
perfect punch of genuine lime flavor (and no fluorescent green additions), this incredibly light and
smooth filling will send key-lime
fans into ecstasy just like our friend,
who, in a state of passion told us,
"Kill me now! I've reached nirvana..."
As we finished the last of our
dessert, we couldn't help but sigh at
the whole experience. Each of us
found something noteworthy about
the place
be it the salmon, the
baked brie, the pasta, the key-lime
pie. Moreover, the service at
Carolina's is professional, and the
servers are down-to-earth, very
knowledgeable, and sincere. Come
here with some great friends and
you are assured to leave loving life
and food.

Swarthmore Spiker War Machine Flattens Philadelphia Textile
by MATT ALFORD
Wow. What a week. I mean,
y'all must be tired of stories of the
men's volleyball club rolling over
another helpless victim. So this

a small portion of the intricate strategy that goes into the Swarthmore
Spiker war machine experience.
This play is a new addition to
the arsenal, one which proved to be

the bane of the Philadelphia Textile

Polar Bears Fall to 'Fords, Still Top Divisional Seed for Nationals
by NOAH SALAMON
Ok. We lied. Last week was
not the last match of the season.

Back by popular demand we will
have our last home match of the
year; and Air Force Academy is
ours. On Saturday, the Polar Bears
squash team heads to Princeton for
the National Tournament
Swarthmore is seeded first in its
division.
Thepast week brought triumph
and agony, joy and despair, tears
and smiles, and a lot of warm feelings for the members of the
Swarthmore Squash team, known
to intimates as the PolarBears. This
scrappy bandofruggedly handsome
men, with little opportunity for future advancement, seized these last
moments of the season as their last
shot at glory before they end up like
the familiar protagonist from the
Springsteen song, sitting on a bar
stool talking about "glory days" to a
broken down ex-high-school sweetheart who's put on weightand grown
facial hair.
I'm referring, of course, to the
Bears' defeat of Georgetown University and George Washinton U.,
and our devastating loss by literally
one point to Haverford on Saturday.
But, as I will explain later, circum-

stantial evidence reveals a conspiracy of unheard of proportions
that renders our impressive showing all the more admirable.
Against Georgetown, the gallantMike Dennis crushed his opponent 3-0, winning the last game 151, at which point, Mike's opponent
revealed thathe was still veryangry
at his father and his strict upbringing by dousing his racket in gasoline, igniting it, and dancing devilishly in the flame. Eddie Lin, at
two, lost in a heartbreaker 2-3
losing one game in a tiebreaker.
The loss is attributed to the fact that
Lin played in borrowed squash gear
specifically a tube dress his girlfriend had worn to theprom. Hunter
Gelbach won handily at three, winning his last game 15-3. Greg Basset (currently spending a weekend
in the infirmary due to a baseball
mishap involving a fastball and his
groin) was steady at five, and Noah
Salamon beat the pants of his female opponent (literally) at six.
Cameron Boyd at seven won 3-0 (if
he had lost we had threatened to
shave his knappy beard) and Chris
Lee took the eight spot the way it
should be done.
GWU was a joke. Why even
bother reporting it? What's more
important is the part they played in

the Great Haverford Conspiracy.
Haverford insisted on playing a
weather-beaten Swarthmore team
at 12:00 on Saturday (after Screw
Your Roommate). And this is the
heart of the Conspiracy, by positioning the game after a major night
at Swarthmore, and buffering itself
with the marshmallow GWU,
Haverford hoped to sap our strength
enough to squeak by with their less
than stellar squad.
The Haverford match. A
droopy eyed Mike Dennis drove the
team over to Haverford in a bus that
has since been condemned due to
the pervasive "alchohol-breath"
smell. Dennis' match was truly like
watching two professionals. Mike
showed incredible style and grace
as well as poise, never giving up
—but ultimately dropped thematch
to his worthy opponent, and despite
Dennis'early 3-0 drubbing last fall
of Haverford, he dropped his first
league match of the year. Afterwards, Dennis commented "I think
I'll takeup needlepoint." Eddie Lin
at two played the game of his life,
defeating the large, ominous, and
often intimidating number two of
Haverford, some guy they call'Terminator." After the match his nickname was changed to "The-guywho-almost-always-wins." Jeff

Moray did not fare well with Dennis' brother Andrew, though he did
manage to injure the lad in a postmatch scuffle involving a piece of
french bread and some herring.
Cameron Boyd was prounounced
dead on arrival at the match, and
technically, his heart had not beat in
two hours, so relaxed was it from
the massive alchohol consumption
that characterized the evening before the match. Using a rough
equivalent of CPR, Brandt Lincoln
and Noah Salamon managed to revive the glassy-eyed Boyd. When
asked for comment, they admitted
that "slapping him around" is not
really a Red Cross authorized means
of resucitation.
At five, Hunter Gelbach performed admirably, housing his
Haverford opponent 3-0. When
asked whether the change in temperature affected his play (the
Haverford courts are significantly
warmer) he said "Warm, you want
warm, I'll show you warm" and
proceeded to bare hischest and hold
me close. At six, Brandt Lincoln
turned in a stellar performance,
though many spectators complained
that he looked silly in his goggles.
"No way, dude, like, totally not,"
said Brandt, who was still a little
shaken up by the sight of the moist

whitesubstance falling from the sky,
the likes of which he had never
experienced. We all thought it was
all in good fun to humor Brandt's
naivete, until he suggested that we
"see what it would be like to make
naked snow angels." We thought it
prudent, as men of the world, to
warn this young boy about the possible dangers to the male genitalia
of such a project, to which he responded, "hey, it'd be no big loss."
At seven, GregBasset played a
hard fought match. Originally up 20, he dropped the match in a tie
breaker that went down to the last
point. Bassett hit the shotofhis life,
but Haverford got lucky won the
point won the match. Basset admitted that the loss was due in part
to his successfulScrew YourRoommate dance the night before.
At eight, Noah Salamon took
down his opponent almost as fast as
he took down the Jim Beam the
night before. Finally, our strongtongued favorite, Justin Watkins,
grabbed a 2-0 lead in his match at
number nine until he dropped three
games faster than he ditched his
date the previous night.

The "Great Zengerle's"

As March Madness Dawns, No. 1 Indiana 'Not' Team to Beat
by

JASON ZENGERLE

Wellkids, it's almost here. You
can practically taste it. If you were
watching the games on CBS this
weekend, you undoubtedly saw
some of the little promotional clips
they were running. Yes, that's right
sportsfans, March Madnessisalmost
upon us.
However, before we all are
consumed by the Madness, I think
we should take a step back and look
at what's happened in the past three
weeks. We've seen Duke struggle
with defeats at the hands of Wake
Forest and Virginia and a narrow
victory over a sorryN.C. State team,
we've seen Arizona emerge as the
best team in the west (but more on
how insignificant that is later),we've
seen Kansas slip a lot with losses to
Long Beach State, Oklahoma, and
lowa State, and we've seen Indiana
sit atop the national polls, taking on
all comers until this past Tuesday
when they fell to Ohio State
•How 'Bout Them Hoosiers: I
know that Indiana most likely won't
retain their number one ranking next
weekafter theirloss to the Buckeyes,
so this whole argument I'm about to
make may not be necessary, but
while they still sit on top of the
college basketball world I'd like to
say that theHoosiers aren't the best
team out there.
There are a lot of people who
consider Bobby Knight's club the
tournament favorite, based on the
team's dominationof the Big Ten.
However, I'd be surprised if the
Hoosiers make it to the Final Four
and I'd be shocked if they came
away with the title.
The problem with Indiana is a
very simple one they don't have
enough players. This is a squad that
only carriers nine kids. Last week,
it appeared that number would
dwindle to eight, when 6'9"
sophomore forward AlanHenderson
sprained his knee, but Pat Graham,
a 6'4" senior guard whohad suffered
-

a broken foot earlier in the season
and who planned to sit theremainder
of the season out in the hope of
gaining a medical hardship year,
was pressed into service.
I realize that the Hoosiers have
the services of Calbert Cheaney,
who incidentally would be my
choice for player of the year. The
6'6" senior forward is a remarkable
player and he may go down as the
greatest player ever to don the red
and white Hoosier silks, but the
same cannot be said of his
teammates.

In Matt Nover, the Hoosiers
have a sturdy and reliable center
and in Alan Henderson they have a
blossoming star, but after those two
players and Cheaney, I don't see
much.
Damon Bailey, the 6'3" junior
guard, has been a monumental
disappointment to some, but I feel
that the expectations placed on this
player have always been too high.
In high school, Bailey played much
of the game with his back to the
basket, using an array of inside
moves to get his points. However,
once in college, the under-sized
wonder was forced to move his game
outside, where he has never been
able to dominate. At his best, Bailey
is a role player.
Joining Bailey in the Indiana
back-court are Greg Graham, Brian
Evans, and Chris Reynolds.
Graham, a 6*4" senior, is probably
thebest ofthese three, but even heis
a marginal player. He possesses
some offensive skills but he never
has blossomed into the prolific
scorer Knight thought he was getting
when he recruited him out of
Indianapolis. Reynolds is a
defensive wonder who is a nonentity on offense: thekid just can't
shoot. The defense he gives you is
great, but you pay a price for when
you're forced to go four-on-five on
the offensiveend. And then there's

Promising Future Awaits as Women's Hoops
Ends Season With Victory Over Haverford
by MATT PECK
The Women of Swarthmore
Basketball concluded their arduous
season with a commanding 48-32
home victory over the Red Wave of
Haverford on Saturday night. The
victory avenged a 38-35 loss suffered to Haverford (2-21) on January 23, and brought the Garnet's
final season record to (4-17).
The Garnet led for all but 22
seconds in a rout motivated by
Swarthmore's balancedscoring and
intense defensive pressure. In her
last game, senior co-captain Liz
Dempsey scored 15points and capturedat least four second-halfsteals
to lead the Garnet to victory. Emily
Walker '96, the team's leading
scorer, had nine points; Heather
Maloney '95 contributed eight
points from the bench; and co-captain Jennifer Tucker '93 finished
her three-year career contributing
eight points to the Garnet cause.
According to my stats, Nancy
Rosenbaum '96 helped the team with
ten rebounds, four steals and two
blocks, although her tenacious play
suggests that these figures could be
too low.

Wrestlers Prepare To Grapple With
Conference Rivals In MAC Championships
byBENSEIGEL
This weekend the men's wrestling season will come to a close as
they compete in the MiddleAtlantic
Conference Championships at
Elizabethtown College. Senior captainsChris Carr andWes Rochette,
along with sophomore Eric Williams, are expected to lead theSwat
wrestlers at the tournament.
Plagued with injuries all season long, the team managed to improve as theyprogressed, according
to thewrestlers. Carr, who hadbeen
restrained from action early in the
season, due to a shoulder malady,
returned to the starting lineup to
finish with a 12-0undefeatedrecord
in his fmal year of wrestling for
Swarthmore. This weekend is expected to be a big one for Carr, as he
searches to win his weight class of

142 pounds in the MAC.

Rochette, who wrestled at
weights in the 150-160 range, got
into form as theregular season progressed to end with an over .500
record. He will be wrestling at 150
this weekend. Williams, who will
be wrestling at 167, also had a good
individualseason and is expected to
lead the team next year. Other
wrestler's who will be representing
Swat at this weekend's tournament
are Mike Madden '95, in the 177
pound class, and Joe Lange, who
will dobattle at 158.
Going into theMAC's, the team
has already been faced with a great
handicap: the combinedloss of 190
pounder Phil Sherman '94 and
heavyweight Joe Moritz '93, due to
physical injuries. As a result of the
injuries, the team is forced to forfeit
these two weight cl asses at thecham-

pionships.
In dual meet competition, Swat
enjoyed its season highlight against
rival Haverford. With the help of a
couple forfeits, Swarthmore was
able to win every individual meet
against the Red Wave.
With nine freshmen on this
year's team, the futureof Swat wrestling is hopeful. The premier freshman were Chaz Teplin and Bobby
Anderson. Teplin, who wrestled in
the 134 weight class and finished
the season with an 8-9 record, is at
the MAC's this weekend. Anderson, who finished third in the state
oflowa last year, is the only other
frosh to join Teplin at the MAC's.
Matt Miller, who wrestled at 177,
also had a good year. Mike
Bernstein, TomHooper, JasonPark,
Hahn Park, and Caleb Olinrounded
out this year's freshmen wrestlers.

Coach Williams. By the way Chris,
departure time is, in fact, 5:30
A.M.; so get some sleep.
But now it is time to focus on the track, where the
runners also tried to keep up
with the blistering pace set by
Coach Martin's Field team.
The coaching expertise here
turns to Coach Williams and
the new man Coach Ted
Dixon. The studs of the team
have to have been Team Captain Delvin Dinkins '93 (Remember the name sportsfans,
that is Dinkins), Michael
Turner '96, and Mark Tolley
'93.
Coach Williams'
overachieving lineup began
with the 4xl lap relay. This
bumper-car-like race found
Dinkins, Turner, Paschel, and
Swat's resident Englishman (to
know him is to love him) Chris
Hourigan '96 running to a respectable third place finish at 1:48.
Next on the Track were the
1500 runners, and yes, Virginia,
MarkTolley will be going toMACs.
Not only did Tolley break his PR by
eight seconds, by running a 4:15.3,
he finished second in the conference. His gutsy race was truly inspiring to the rest of his cheering
teammates. John Freeman '96
should also not be forgotten as his
respectable 4:20 will set him up to
be a sleeper when he hits the
Dickinson fieldhouse Track this
Saturday in a ball offire.
The 55m hurdles were next and
did you know who showcased his
skills? You didn't? Well, Nate
Barbour '96 (the silent Stud ofSwat
track) ran a great hurdles race and
his dedication this season to the
lonely hurdles will only serve him
well in the outdoor season. The
400 m followed Nate and here it was
all Dinkins. In his second of four
races of the day, Delvin ran a respectables2.B tocome into4thplace.
Mike Turner also ran an admirable

looked back (foreshadowing his

Sunday) enroute to a 2:05, with
Ralph close behind with a workmanlike 2:12. Heat two left WilliamRoth '93 alone against thepack.
Well, trying a new race strategy
(i.e., trying anything to win), Roth
was able to push himself to a 2:02.3
and a second place overall in the
Conference. Although Roth's race
placed him 2nd overall, heat one's
race brought infinitely more excitement, as Captain Duane theD-Train
Malone '93, brought new meaning
to the words, "Showtime, Baby."
His thirdplace finish in his heat and
fourth place overall was a work of
pure beauty and heart.
The 5000 m was next on the
track, and Guian McKee'92/3 successfully defended his Centennial
Crown by winning the race going
away. The return ofLorinObler '93
brought the track to a fever pitch as
he ran to a second place finish. John
Arent '93 also obtained his highest
finish at Swat with a crucial fourth
place.
The 4x400m and the 4xBoom
relays were once again exciting finishes to a great day of Track and
