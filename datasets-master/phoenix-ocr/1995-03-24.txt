Opposing Values Discussed
at Hate-Speech Collection
By Elizabeth Weber
Students, faculty, and administraaired opposing views on speech
codes at the first campus collection
last Friday. At the collection, members of the Task Force on Speech
stressed that the mission of the task
force is broader than the consideration of whether Swarthmore should
adopt some sort of hate-speech code
and what form such a code should
take. Nonetheless, the question of
whether Swarthmore should adopt
hate-speech code was thecollection's
primary theme.
In an interview Thursday, president Al Bloom expressed that the
issueis a difficult onebecause, "when
you have two very deep ethical principles it is unlikely that you'll come
to a solution that defends one at the
expense of the other." He also said
that both principles are at the core of
the community.
After introductory remarks by
Bloom and Oberdiek, Assistant Dean
Tedd Goundiepresented the college's
current policies. A hate-speech code
was specifically excluded from the
just-finished 3 year revision of the
college judiciary system and student
code of conduct, he said, although
the Harassment section of the code of
conduct does include the prohibition
of demeaning behavior directed to-

included die chalking of Magill Walk
with racial epithets last year, this
fall' s defacementof theLBG A board
in P.-urish, offensive anonymous email messages and allegations that a
certain male student was a rapist
which were posted in women's bathrooms, among others. Hate speech at
Swarthmore has usually been anony-

wards a particular person and behav-

may also push hate speech under-

ior which creates a hostile environ-

ground instead of stopping it, she
said, and thus it is better stopped
through education, both in and out of
the classroom.

How Other Schools
Deal With Hate Speech
•University ofPennsylvania—Had
a speech code until last year, when it
was thrown out after a highly publicized incident in which a student was
punished for v iolating the hate-speech
code because he called a group of
students "water buffaloes."
•SUNY Stonybrook—Does not
have a speech code, because of the
many codes which have been ruled
unconstitutional. According to the
Dean of Undergraduate Students,
"Constitutionalityis a particular concern for public universities."
•Yale University—Has a "free
speech policy" incorporated into undergraduate regulations. Statement
encourages "free expression, peaceful dissent, and consideration" when
using free expression. Formal sanctions against hate speech are included.

On Duty

•Harvard University—According
John Fox of the Secreatary of the
Faculty's office, "we believe that it's
not possible to legislate propriety."
Nonetheless, a source in the Dean's
office said Harvard adopted "speech
guidelines" in 1990, which "just say
it positively instead of negatively."
•CarletonCollege—While the college does not have a speech Code, a
"Statement on Discrimination and
Academic Freedom" attempts to differentiatebetweenacademic dialogue
and discrimination. The policy aims
to "eliminate certain behavior and
actions on the campus" while acknowledging that "the environment
will not always be comfortableforall
members of the community."

Dean of the CollegeNginaLy thcott
then cited examples of hate speech

mous, she noted.

Members of the task force then
presented arguments for and against
the implementation of hate-speech
codes, emphasizing that these were
not

necessarily the beliefs of their

presenters.

Professor Westphal notedthemany
negative effects of hate speech, and
presented the arguments for the
implementation of hate-speech codes.
Racism is something that is learned,
he said, and can therefore be unlearned.
He also said that hate speech is
particularly hurtful in an academic
setting. Furthermore, he said, the re-

sponses to hate speech can lend it
legitimacy as a means of embarking
on discourse.
Professor Wagner-Pacifici then
presented the arguments against the
implementation of hate-speech codes.
Hate-speech codes may infringe on
freedom of expression. Such codes

The taskforce is preparing to make
recomendations to the college administration, which may include nonadjudicative ways of discussing demeaning speech, speaker series,
workshop for faculty and staff members, the creation of sounding boards,
or new regulations, including some
form of a speech code.
"We're taking a broad based survey of ways of dealing with speech,
and exploring what's out there already," saidSethHarvey '97,amemberofthe task force. "We're looking
at what other colleges have
done... we've had a large reading list.
We're trying to answer two questions: 'What would work at Swarthmore?' and 'What would be best for
Swarthmore?'"
Part of the mandate of the task
force is to determine what sort of
speech would be classified as hate
speech under any policy it recommends. "It's difficult to discourage
more insidious but more subtlekinds
of racism, sexism, homophobia, and
so forth," Oberdiek said. However,
the task force does not want to discourage speech which grows from
genuine and rationally thought out
religious and moral convictions. "A

Roman Catholic student arguing
against abortion may upset some students, especially any student who has

had an abortion, but I don't want to
discourage such discussions." In
Bloom's opinion, part of the problem
is that "it is easier to define hate
speech then to decidewhether a given
instance falls under that definition."

Safewalkers Are Walking Alone
By Jon Francis

However, many students remain
uneasy about disturbing Safewalkers

Safe walk and Garnet Patrol are
worthwhile security programs even
though few students take advantage
of them, organizers of the two programs said.
Eric Ellingson '96, Safewalk coordinator, said eight to ten walks are
given on an average night, but six to
eight of them are normally given by
the newly-formed Garnet Patrol, so
Safewalk is averaging only two walks
per night.
Safewalker John Christodouleas
'9B suggested the rate may be even
lower, saying he gives a walk only
once every three or four weeks.
"[Safewalk] is basically not used,"
Christodouleas said. 'That's the fault
of the community."
Campus incidents have at times
caused dramatic rises in Safewalk
use. Horton said that he gave six to
seven Safewalks each night around
the time of the muggings on campus
last fall. Christodouleas said, "Any
time something suspicious occurs, I
start to get business. I think that's a
good role we play."
Maggie Gold '95 pointed to problems of Safewalker absenteeism and
approachability whenshe created the
Garnet Patrol, a new program that
pays students to walk specific routes
on campus, give Safewalks if asked,
and report suspicious persons to the
department of public safety. "It's a
definite deterrent to crime on campus," Safewalker Charles Horton '96
said.
But most Safewalkers have been
conscientious about their jobs this
semester, according to Horton, who
works weekly at the Parrish desk to
which all Safewalkers must report
during their shifts. "People seem to
report to post," Horton said.

who are studying or engaged in a
conversation."There have been times
when I wanted to ask for a Safewalk
but I felt uncomfortable doing so,"
Gold said.
Christodouleas said people find it
"somehow embarrassing to ask [for
a S afewalk]. It's too bad more people
don'tfeel comfortable asking for a
Safewalk."
Some students, though, find
Safewalkers a valuable resource.
NaomiMichlin '9B said, "I'vefound
Safewalkers very available. They've
been very helpful in walking me
where I needed to go. I think it's a
valuable service and a necessary
one."
Michlin also said she was surprised to hear that so few Safewalks
are given since Safewalkers are, in
her opinion, readily available.
Horton and Christodouleas both
think Safewalk is worthwhile despite its infrequent use. 'Though it's
not used so much, it's still worth the
trouble," said Horton.
"It's sadly underused," Christodouleas said, "but that's not a good
reason to discontinue the program.
There are some people who say it
looks like a really easy job. Those
people are wrong. It's really easy.
But itprovides something to the campus, if only making people feel secure. It shows that the school cares
and has concern."
Christodouleas suggested that the
program could be more successful if
it were advertised more during orientation and if a way could befound
to make it more accepted to request
Safewalks.
According to Ellingson, the
Safewalk program is basically the
same this year as in the past. How-

ever, all Safewalkers now have radios, which Ellingson feels is a good
safety measure. A Safewalk location

was also added at Beardsley this semester. The Beardsley Safewalker
has been used some, thought not as
much as was expected, said Ellingson.

February Fire in Parrish
Remains a Mystery

By Matt Hellman

Wondering whether or not the early-morning fire in Parrish last month was theresult of
arson? So are investigators from the Pennsylvania State Police, to whom the Swarthmore
Borough Fire Chief has turned over the investigation.
According to Owen Redgrave, Director of
Public Safety, officials are still classifying the
fire as "suspicious." Redgrave said Swarthmore
Public Safety officers have "acted as a liaison
to the State Police" to help determine the cause
of the fire.

Keck Grant Nets College
$500,000 For Kohlberg
Hall Construction

The W.M. Keck Foundationof Los Angeles
gave the College a $500,000 grant to pay for
part of Kohlberg Hall, said Ellen Wylie, Director of Foundation and Corporate Relations.
The grant, one of 31 awarded by the foundation this winter, will help fund construction of
the new building's third floor, which will be
occupied by the department of modern languages and literatures.
"This is a really large grant for them, and one
that we feel honored to receive," Wylie said.
"What they've told us is that it reflects their
board's very strong faith in us and in what we
do." The foundation primarily supports scientificresearch, and rarely gives grants for liberal
arts projects, Wylie added.
According to Wylie, the Keck grant is the
second-largest that the College has received
this year. The College also received a grant of
more than $1 million from the Joyce Mertz
Gilmore Foundation. But the College did not
have to apply for that grant, unlike the Keck
one, because the Gilmore grant is given to
Swarthmore almostevery year in memory ofits
namesake, who graduated from Swarthmore in
1951 and who created the foundation.

SAO Turns Inward For
Awareness Month

In addition to helping the entire campus
understand Asian-Americans' contributions to
society, Asian-American awareness events this
month are building group unity and political
awareness within the Swarthmore Asian Organization, SAO leaders said.
Most of the month's activities, which include movies, lectures, and a panel discussion,
are open to the public, but two workshops—on
Asian-American political identity and on
homophobia andbiracial relationships—are for
Asian-American students only. "We want to
focus in andbuild community within SAO first
before we can go out and participate in any sort
of political issues," explained Debbie Lee '95,
SAO's Intercultural Center intern.
Tarn Doan '9B, Community Outreach and
Service Coordinator for SAO, said the closed
workshops help SAO members who come from
divergent backgrounds to discuss complex political issues. "Within the group it may be easier
to talk about things we've thought about and
haven't actually voiced," Doan said.

Sub-Free Rooms Part of
Regular Lottery This Year
Students who wantto live on substance free
halls next year will have to deal with the stress
of choosing rooms with the masses: sub-free
rooms will be allocated with regular lottery
numbers this year.
Students choosing substance-free housing

will be required to sign a contract which states
the restrictions on the hall lists the penalties
incurred if the contract is violated. A copy of
this contract will be made available as soon as
it is finalized, probably next week.
Dana Lower Level, Mertz Third North and
Mertz Third South will all be sub-free next
year, due to the high demand expressed at a
meeting Wednesday night. According to the
Housing Committee, these halls include a total
of 55 spaces.
No first-year students will be placed on subfree halls next year.
For more information on substance-freehousing, contact James Solodar '97 at x 1569 or
Cristy De La Cruz '96 at x 1270.

Willets Will Get Major
Facelift This Summer
By Sam Schulhofer -Wohl
Almost every room in Willets Dormitory
will get new furniture, new carpeting, and a
fresh coat of paint during construction scheduled for this summer, said Alice Balbierer,
Assistant Director—Special Projects in the
Department of Facilities Management.
Otherconstruction work on campus this summer will include installation of new hallway
lighting in Mertz Hall in response to complaints that the building is too dark, Balbierer
said.
Outside contractors will do most of the work,
which is part of a long-term plan to repair and
renovate all dorms at Swarthmore. Balbierer
estimated the total cost of the renovations in
Willets and Mertz will be about $400,000.
The Willets project is the first major renovationof that dorm since it was built in 1959, said
Balbierer. "That's the original furniture," she
said.
All furniture except beds will be replaced
this summer. The College wanted to purchase
wooden beds that are heavier thanthe old metal
ones, but many students move their beds out of

Security Briefs

The following incidents were reported to
the Department of Public Safety during the

a bicycle from the basement of Wharton.

reported a missing small tree. Also reported
were broken plant slakes.

their rooms and students wouldnot have been
able to move the new beds easily, Balbierer
explained.
Work crews will also install ceiling lights in
every room, modify closet doors so they will be
easier to open, and put in new lighting and
countertops in the bathrooms. No work will be
done on rooms on the lower level of Willets,
because those rooms were built just two years
ago and are still in good shape.
The renovations should substantially improve
the quality of many Willets rooms. While some

their rooms were

in
ceptable condition, others described bookshelves that fall apart when books are placed on
them, chests that are missing drawers, and
carpets coated in bubble gum.
"I don't think the furniture is in terrible
condition," said Lauren Basta '9B, a Willets
second floor resident. "It's just not as good as
ac-

other dorms."
Students who are considering rooming in
Willets next year and would like to see carpet
swatches or photographs of the new furniture
can contact Balbierer in the physical plant

building.

Kevin Clements, president of the International Peace Research Association, called for a
more rational, moral approach toresolving the
problems the world is facing in a lecture
Wednesday night.
In the opinion of the speaker, in a world that
is simultaneously and paradoxically moving
towards globalism and nationalism, the conflicts of the upcoming century will not be between nations, butrather within them.
Clements argued that the world wars of this
century will be replaced, and indeed have already begun to be replaced, by civil wars and
domestic strife.
Clements described the warning signs of
impending strife in a country to be a "fragile
economy, ethnic rivalry, and a totalitarian
leader." By recognizing these warning signs as
early as possible, he believes, we will be more
able to defuse these conflicts before they flare
up destructively.
Arguing that a more optimistic view can be
taken in conflict resolution, he posited that if
"philosophy were to be applied to politics, and
if truth were applied to power," it would improve the peaceprocess.
To this end, Clements called for arevitalization of the United Nations so that it could
function more effectively in a neutral role.
Noting that the city government of Philadelphia has more staff members than the entire
United Nations, he said it was no mystery that
the multinational organization is severely overworked.
Clements promoted many general approaches
to resolving domestic conflicts, including making sure all parties to the conflict are also
involved innegotiations, focusing on the education of the peoples involved, and attempting
to equitably redistribute power among the given
groups.

When asked by an audience member how he
would convince a party in power to share its
authority, Clements responded that to make

such a deal palatable, it would have to be
phrased in such a way that the powerful party
would be convinced that it would "gain by
giving" during the negotiations.

Audience reaction to Clements' speech was
quite positive. Libby Tyndale, a sophomore,
remarked that she agreed with his focus on
education, butalso was intrigued withClements'
more short term solutions.
"I used to think we should start with the kids

and wait 40 years, but now I wonder
start sooner," she said.

College Resources for

Survivors Signs Stir
Questions, Anger
By Sam Schulhofer-Wohl

Students reacted with surprise,
tears, jokes and nervous laughter to
the numerous signs postedby Friends
ofSurvivors thisweek to drive home
the point that sexual assault and harassment affect people in all segments of the community.
The signs, most of which started
out with the words "I'm a survivor
and...," were among Survivors'
Week activities and events that also
included a movie showing, lunchtime discussions on sexual misconduct, and a lecture. Many students
wore yellow ribbons to show support
for survivors.
Colleen Bartley '96, a leader of
Friends of Survivors, said that while
reactions to the week were mixed,
the week still succeeded in bringing
out issues of sexual misconduct.
"I've heard conversations where
people have both liked the signs and
not liked the sings and liked the ribbons and not liked the ribbons, but
the fact thatpeople are talking about
them and not ripping them down is a
good thing," she said. "One person, a
survivor, was talking to me about it,
and they were saying that it's good to
know that there's a community of
survivors here.Because [sexual misconduct] is not spoken about, it's
very easy for that person to feel alone
or isolated."
The signs were intended "to voice
these seldom-heard sentiments and
to increase awareness of how personal and how close to home these
issues are for theentire community,"
saidDana Lee Yamate '96, a Friends
of Survivors leader.
Joy Oliver '97 said the overall effect of the signs was overwhelming.
"Halfway down Parrish, I almost
started crying," she said.
"One [sign] that really hit me was
one that said, 'l'm a survivor and it
happened in Dana,'" said Mara
Landers '97. "It scared the living
daylights out ofme. I sometimes think
of Swarthmore as a very safe place,
and seeing [a sign] like that makes
me think that I'm naive because no
place is completely safe" from issues
of sexual misconduct.
At least some members of the community decided that the best way to
respond to the signs was to deface
them. One irate person scrawled "f—-you" on sign that read, "I'm a survivor and I'm in a good relationship,"
and another added the words "and a
bad speller too" to a sign with a
misspelled word on it, members of
Friends of Survivors said.
The people who wrote on the signs
did so anonymously, which Bartley
said adds to "the problem of silencing, because by avoiding a problem
we're not going to deal with it."
First-year studentSeth Murray said
that while the signs had definitely
raised awareness about sexual misconduct, he wished they had made it
even clearer that real people are victims of harassment and assault. "I
think they 're good because theybring
problems to people's attention by
making them more visible. [But] I
don't think they go far enough in
personalizing the victims," he said.
Yamate said every signrepresented
the actual experience of the person
who made it or of a person who the
sign-maker knows. "All of the signs
are madeby survivors and friends of
survivors as an expression of their
feelings and experiences," she said.
Some students wondered whether
the signs would have been more effective ifthey had shownstatistics on
sexual misconduct, but others said
the personal nature of the signs which
were posted sent a stronger message.
"Statistics might be powerful in a
way, but just one person is powerful
enough for me," Oliver said.
Gender Education Advisor Karen
Henry said she knew of only two or
three incidents of sexual misconduct

I

this year, compared six or seven
last year. She emphasized, though,
that many incidents go unreported
because survivors don't want to discuss what happened to them or because they don't know where to turn
for support and assistance.
"I thinkthat it's clearly outlined in
the Handbook, but people don'tread
the Handbook," Henry said. "I don't
think that people are very clear on
their options."
To help students understand their
options better, Henry is planning educational meetings for next semester
on the various resources available to
support survivors here.
She is also organizing a "resource
team" that will work with students
involved in incidents of sexual misconduct.
The team, composed of eight faculty and staff members in addition to
Henry, has already participated in
training sessions on counseling assault and harassment survivors and
on support resources for survivors at
Swarthmore. It will start work later
this semester or next fall depending
on how much time team members
have to work out final details.

Storytelling Still a
Valued Art in Peru
By Brenda Arellano

foT some Swarthmare students an
ideal job would be one m which they
would get paid just to talk, tell stories, or share their opinions. Well,
such a "job", or rather, an oral tradition exists in Peruvian culture. A
lecture on Tuesday, March 21st, entitled "Written Official Culture and
Oral Marginal Culture: The Case of
Story Tellers in the Streets of Lima,
Peru" was given by professors Juan
Biondi and Eduardo Zapata of the
University of Lima's Literature and
Linguistics department
The lecture focused on the importanceofthe oral storytelling tradition
in Peru, where men (women are not
included in this tradition) stand on
the streets of downtown Lima and
talk for several hours a day.
There are about three or four of
these venders per street. However,
these men aren't selling typical commodities. Rather, they areselling their
words, and people from every sector
of society come andpay to hear them
talk and tell folk stories, comment on
politics, reinterpret literature, or draw
comical insights into life. For example, the professors spoke of one
storyteller who tells a story ofhis ail-

knowing son* who can do everything from explain how to say things
in English to analyze Peruvian politico.

This oral marginal culture has
great significance lor die people of
Peru, who see written culture as
belonging to the European world,
which emerged after theSparash conquest of the Americas. The indigenous view towards the
that the arm of the conquest was the
book" said professor Biondi. They
believe oral tradition provides more
room for symbolism and m-deprh
iUumination than written culture.
ProfessorBiondi provided the ex-

ample that while in written culture
the word "hut'* might be interpreted
as a dwelling, fortress, or house, in
oral culture "hut" could be reinterpreted to symbolize poverty or oppression,
Gilbert Mireles *96, was pleased
by the lecture. "I was familiar with
these ideas about unofficial Peruvian society and marginalized
people. But I enjoyed the opportunity of not just reading about this
stuff m a book, but actually hearing
and engaging in dialogue with the
professors on how people in Peru
really carry out these traditions."

Victims of rape have the option to
file a criminal complaint with the

charges, and the option to sue for
damages in civil court. Knowledge
of these options takes some of the
fear out of reporting rape, and exercising these options and asserting my
legal rights within the system has
been an important step in bringing
some sense of closure to my rape.

Letters to the Editor
Do Liberals Really
Show Tolerance?
To the Editor:

I find it ironic that Swarthmore's
"liberals" pride themselves on being
tolerant. They usually brand the religiousright, and correctly so, for being intolerant By advocating prayer
in public school, the members of the
Right seek to impose their beliefs
upon others. But the liberals are just

as intolerant as the conservatives.
The socialists are a secularizedreligious right.
Both liberals and conservatives
advocate that the government support causes they deem worthy. Advocating government involvement in
economics is the advocacy of imposing one's beliefs upon an other. A
conservative thinks large oil companies are good, so he wants to subsidize the industry. A liberal thinks the
poor need help, so he wants to subsidize charities.

When a bill for a government subsidy is passed, itforces me to support
it with my tax money. If I refuse to
pay my taxes, the government will
initiateforce on me. Hence, taxes are
a form ofcrime. But neither the Left
nor the Right find their support of
organized crime disturbing.

Just what do I support with my tax
money? I am supporting what others
deem as good. These people are imposing their notion of good upon me.
My body, mind included, produced
my money. What ever happened to
the Pro-Choice "keep your laws off

liberals.
But I hold that my life belongs to
me, and that no one has a right to one
minute of my life. I shall deal with
others on mutual and consenting
terms. I think that humans need the
freedom from force imposed by others in order to live as rational beings.
But anyone who advocates nonvoluntary government funding is not
very tolerant to my views. Taxation
is the imposition of one's values upon
another. It is intolerant.
Who is tolerant? The radicals for
pure laissez-faire capitalism and voluntary government funding. They are
the Libertarians, and the truly tolerant folk of Swarthmore should vote
for them.

A Sharpies Update
from Marianne
Hello to all my friends,
Is it me, or does it seem as though
we've justreturned from winter break
and here we are at the end of the
school year?
Many students have inquired about
the newest addition to our dining

services. She is Janet Kassab, who
previously managed the snack bar.
We are truly delighted to have her as
part of the Sharpies management staff.
I'm sure you will find Janet very
accommodating and open to your
suggestions, needs, or comments.
As you are aware, we are constantly trying to make dining at

Sharpies a pleasant experience. One
of the changes we've made is that the
grill now caters to your individual
needs when perhaps nothing else
seems appealing.
Lovingly,
Marianne Luviner

Look for more from Marianne next

Americans Need to Start Taking Responsibility
A look at problems in America, ranging from mandatory prayer in school to the censorship of the mass media
By Krister Olsson

Only once every so often does
a "revolutionary" mind actually appear and act out of something other
than self-interest.

more than ever, America is becomcrats.

How can someone be taught to think

has deemed to be irrefutably correct is

depressing; that would be too cliche
a topic for a Phoenix opinion piece.
Crime seems to be the result of something far more sinister whichis clouding the mindsof theAmerican people.
The problem doesn't really seem
to be a partisan issue, because, as
everyone knows, once theupper echelons of government are reached,
there is a near symmetry between the
actions of Republicans and Demo-

ing a nationwhich tries to cure its ills
by covering up its problems or by
applying quick fixes, rather than by
dealing with issues of responsibility.
Currently, the country is talking
about the "ContractWith America."
Finally, we'll have a return to oldfashioned family values and everyone will be rich and happy and good
and clean and wonderful. Let's look
at one of the ideas being bandied

about: mandatory prayer in schools.
This is a brilliant idea which seeks
to teach the youth of America—the
real troublemakers—how to be morally upright like their parents. (Translation: it seeks to teach the youth of
America to put plans for criminal
activities on hold until they are older,
more intelligent, and can engage in
much more profitable white-collar
crime.) This is a perfect example of
howAmerica is becoming interested
only in quick fixes.
Schools are supposed to be institutions designed to promote free
thought and intellectual development.
Adding a mandatory prayer session to the beginning of the school
day works completely against those
ideals. How can someone be taught
to think freely when a dogma that a
higher power has deemed to be irrefutably correct is forced down his or
her throat? Unfortunately, thethought
that today's youth will suddenly become clean, upright, and God-fearing thanks to school prayer is enough

Americans' palates.
Perhaps thisis an extreme example.
Making prayer in schools mandatory
is an incredibly radical change by
any stretch of the imagination. Howto whet many

ever the idea that thereal solutions to
this nation's problems can be found
by simply forcing those who differ
from the norm to conform has been
creeping into the arts and entertainment industries for many years now.

Hate Speech Revisited: Damaged Roots
By Keelyn Bradley
Recently, while sitting at dinner
with a friend in Tarble, I was violated
and exploited. In the middle of going
over one of the day's more leisurely
moments, my friend and I were interrupted by a greeting from a white
woman who was a mutual acquaintance. I felt herhand patting my head,
her fingers violently searching at the
roots of my hair.
For that one brief moment I could
not speak or move, my body had been

itselfmust be interrogated for simple
notions of "pluralism." It is troubling
to hear this argument framed as one
in which the liberty of free speech is
being violated. In this regard free
speech absolves this institution of
any responsibility for the role it has
had in helping to sustain the positions of oppressive force.
The purpose of the First Amendment is to foster the greatest amount
ofspeech and discourse that will serve

imposition of having been used as an
object to test and explore my difference. I was immediately reminded of
so many of the stories I had heard
from other black students who had
experienced similar situations. Political and socioeconomic privilege
allowed to function in this liberal
institution make it possible for white
students to consider their physical
contact with Blacks as part of a necessary process in conceiving and affirming theirrealities.

intellectual production, this inevitably leads to a privileging of formal
discourse and thought that serves to
permanently marginalize certain

seventy-two black students and nonblack supporters still sitting in front

of the Admissions Office waiting to

action. While it was directly related
to the defamatory statement found on
Magill Walk thatread "F—Niggers,"
the demonstration was a statement
thatrecognized institutionalproblems
thatled to therepeated occurrence of
similar happenings directed at
women, queers, and other peoples of
color. One of the demands that came
out of that demonstration was the
ideaof a hate speech policy. This has
sparked a number of discussions
around concepts of free speech.
Some people feel thatsuch a policy
would limit the freedom to articulate
one's political positions and beliefs
on campus. This argument echoes
the sanctity of an institutionof higher
learning in which knowledge and
truth might be pursued with impunity, no matter how racist, sexist, or
heterosexist the pursuit of thatknowledge may be. Anyone questioning
the intentions and sincerity of such

groups on this campus. Federal and
state courts have held that speech
cannot be regulated in public forums

where the listener can avoid speech
regarded as offensive by changing
course

or direction, but unregulated

speech in institutions of higher learning is not supported. The annual
spring bash of Blacks, Latino/as,
Asians, women, and queers—on sidewalks, bulletin boards, desks, doors,

and every other imaginable or unimaginable smooth or unsmooth surface on this campus—is an inhumane
ritual that we have allowed to thrive
due to institutional validation.
The "Words That Wound" collectionshowed how differences that re-

ceive focus lead to changes in events
and issues on this campus. The collection was a creative retelling of an
important historical situation. The
cute fliers used to advertise the collection did not call attention to the
terror felt by many blacks and other
groups who have become targets of
perpetual violence on this campus.
Its light pastel colors and catchy title
did not recall the sit-in and the march

physical and intellectual attacks that
have been waged in campus life and
in the classroom. Rather, it served as
a form of nostalgia to be consumed
by hopeful black alumni as they celebrated the 25th Anniversary of the
Black Cultural Center during this
year's Black Alumni Weekend.

Most discussions of the hate
speech/ free speech debate have not
included incidence of institutional
terror and destructiveprojections of
hate. Parrish's walls have recently
been used by the Christian Fundamentalist Right and those opposed to
the movement against Proposition
187 to post pictures of Blacks and
Latinos/Latinas that advertise an open
invitation for critical discussion.

Many of these pictures are not accompanied by blank sheets of paper,
so they become message boards—to
be drawn on and written over. Certain freedoms have been given privilege at Swarthmore.

stead, the flier reads like a symposium or faculty lecture.

Trying to serve thedualpurpose of
remembrance and promise, the collection advertisement did not make
account of the failure of this "corn-

sive"media.The end result ofall that
hard work by Tipper Gore and her
partners was a little warning sticker
on records, CDs, and cassettes published by major music labels stating
thatthe work in question wasn't necessarily good for kids. That sticker
evolved into a permanent blemish on
the cover art of all such albums.
So where are we now? It is hardly

worried about organizations like the
PMRC. If this were to become law,
chances are that many malls would
stop stocking stickered albums altogether. Right now there is no such
law, so there is no real fear of an irate
parent suing the record store—they
have already submitted to the
PMRC's stickering agenda. Were it
to become law, however, mall stores

would probably not want to take any
chances—some of their largest clientele being those banned frompurchasing the albums.
The most irritating partof this trend

books, like Catcher in the Rye. The
subject matter is no worse than the
lyrics in your average stickered album.
Next on the agenda may be a return to the days of yesteryear when

the friendly Bible-thumping Christian fundamentalists living next door
could regulate what you listen to,
watch, and read. What thisboils down
to is that a large number of parents in
this country are simply ineffective.
Rather than look after their children,
they propose that the government
and businesses do it for them.
With prayer in schools, Americans are foisting theresponsibility of
creating model citizens on the government. These measures accomplish
nothing except to generally tick
people off and restrict the freedoms
of all Americans.
Unlike the conservatives who
stood proudly in front of the American flag in Common Sense a few
issues ago telling people to love or
leave the United States of America,
I'd rather tell people to start taking

more responsibility for themselves
so that America doesn't become a
hateable, homogenized wasteland.

How to get Money from the Social Affairs Committee
The Social Affairs Committee is, in effect, the way that
Szvarthmore has fun. It is the branch of Student Council
that develops and implements all campus social activities. It grants party permits, allocates space, and cosponsors all-college events, including the Formals.
By Andrew Elmore
The way for students to obtain SAC funding
and party permits starts
weekly

meeting, held Wednesday evening at 6:15 in
Sharpies ("Right by the toasters," says Social
Coordinator Chris Ciunci, *95). At this time,
students who wish to host events during the
following weekend should come with a written proposal explaining their plan for the event
and the amount of funding they are requesting

for it. SAC considers the proposal and makes
their decision by 7:15 that evening. If permission is granted, the student(s) may apply for a
party permit on the spot. This is returned to
SAC, which turns it over for approval to
Assistant Dean Fernando Chang-Muy, who
sends it back to the student through campus
mail. The students must display this permit on

their wall during the party. In the event that the
student(s) misses the Wednesday night meeting, he or she may apply for an impromptu
permit later, for a fee of $lO, from The

Department of Public Safety.
During the Wednesday night meetings,
SAC also decides the amount of money to
allot for the event. This may or may not be the
amount requested by the student, according to
what SAC determines. Following the meeting,
hosts-to-be go with the SAC treasurer to the
office of Student Council Budget Committee
to get a check for the amount. The student then
spends the money to buy supplies and hold the
event, then, within two weeks, brings receipts
for the full amount back to SAC, to prove that
it was all used as proposed.
SAC's over $35,000 budget is funded by
two sources. Most of its budget comes from

If you are interested in receiving funding, please complete the questions below and
forward them to Assistant Dean Fernando Chang-Muy. He, together with a
committee of students, will review the applications for funding. The rest of the

Cohen and Mike Pan), the Student Council Budget Committee Chair (Tanisha
Little), the Social Affairs Committee Chairs (Chris Ciunci and Alice Stillman), and the
Chair of Forum For Free Speech (Ellen Holloman).

the Student Activity Fee that is included in
every student's annual tuition, and is appropriated by
the Budget Committee.
Approximately $25 of the $193 charged of
each student this year went to SAC. Other
funds come from the Deans' and other discretionary funds.
Due to recent changes, the twelve-member
SAC functions in a more broad role than last
year. Committee members are now responsible for proposing and organizing at least one
event per month, in addition to the weekly
responsibilities distributing funds for parties.
According to Chang-Muy, "Now they are not
just giving out money, they have an overview
on how to fill out the time."
According to Social Coordinator Alice
Stillman '96, who runs SAC with partner
Ciunci, "We decide about what we want to do
and make suggestions, but we bring all the
proposals to SAC. We never make decisions
on our own... Everyone reaches a consensus
on everything. We organize things and delegate responsibilities."

The Social Affairs Committee resembles
in distributing funds to
soliciting groups. However, there are three
major distinctions between the two groups.
First, the Budget Committee is a more stable organization, and works under the auspices of the Student Council. BC consists of
10 members appointed by Student Council, in
addition to a salaried Treasurer and two assistant Treasurers hired by BC. The 10 BC members vote on budgets for chartered organizations. In comparison, SAC members are
selected by SC and the Deans.
Second, BC has much more flexibility with
its funds than the Social Affairs Committee.
BC works with a fixed pool of funds set by
the Student Activity fee. This pool is approximately $250,000 for the 1994-95 year. Funds
left over at the end of the year, which may
amount to between five and ten percent of
BC's budget, are rolled over into their general reserve account for the next year. So, any
funds that the Budget Committee saves can be
distributed at the end of the year to chartered
organizations, or saved for the next year.
In contrast, because SAC is a chartered
organization, it must spend all its funds. It any
is left over at ihe end of the year, SAC loses
the Budget Committee

events," and thought that she and Ciunci, who
had previously been active in programs to this
effect, would be able to further that goal.
New events, such as a concert by the Dave
Matthew's Band, scheduled for next semester,
are intended to enhance SAC's role and nonalcohol based entertainment on campus. Further,
if the Deans implement their planned program of
Party Associates (salaried workers to administer
parties), events which serve alcohol will be more
responsibly addressed. Giovanna Giuliani '97,
who will act as next year's Social Co-coordinator with Matthew Minero '96, says that the nonalcohol mission of SAC "might have a bigger
impact next year if the Party Associates are
implemented and used."
Most importantly, in order to fully capitalize
on the new role of the Social Affairs
Committee, as Ciunci emphasizes that "publicity is the most important thing." He notes the
new Student Activities Board in Parrish and
the Student Council's new weekly e-mailing as
signs of the Student Council's efforts to make
the Student Body more aware. Minero plans to
undertake a campaign next year to increase
awareness of SAC's role on campus.
According to all the Social Coordinators,
SAC's role must become an acknowledged
part of life at Swartmore in order to fully serve
the social needs of the College community.

that money and risks a lower apportionment of
funds for the next year. Thus, SAC sets priority on using its funds in order to maintain its
role in the community.
Third, BC has a much more constant pool of
potential solicitors. BC annually distributes its
funds to around 100 budgeted groups which
are chartered through the Student Council. BC
Treasurer Tanisha Little '97 says that there are
standard procedures for funding. For example,
standard allocation for publicity and administration for any group is $lO, while refreshments after a lecture usually receives $2O.
SAC, on the other hand, funds groups based on
the feasibility of their proposal. While this
lack of structure provides for a more flexible
format, it renders SAC subject to the changes
in funding patterns as Committee membership
and priorities change every year.
Ironically, one of the Social Coordinators'
main problems is finding things to do with all
their money. Ciunci laments, "We will invest
as much of the $7OO per week as we can. The
problem is where to give it." To meet this
demand, SAC now seeks out and funds outside
entertainment. This year, such outside entertainment has included a Virtual Reality party
(with machines that make you feel like you're
a living video game) and an A Cappella
singing group which performed in Sharpies
Dining Hall. Ciunci also emphasizes SAC's
desire to find ways to "get students outside
campus." In this vein, last semester SAC funded Student Advantage Cards, which give students discounts on entertainment and services
in Philadelphia and beyond.
In the reformation of SAC, it was decided
that there would be increased attention paid to
non-alcoholic entertainment. According to
Stillman, "the College was revising their

Here's What The Suits Really Wanted To Say To You
Having received enough mail to judge the
"form letter writing Olympics" (there are that
many entries) we. With Bared Teeth, along with
countless other Seniors, have devised apian—our
own Utopia, where these form letters are no
longer cushioned inpolite gobbledygook but actually say what they mean. (And we mean mean!)
Imagine, if you will, a world of truth.
Everyone is straight with their emotions, feelings, or whether or not they want to discuss your
qualifications further in a second interview. It
does take a lot of imagination, but put your creative thinking caps on—we know you can do it
Imagine that your professor can actually tell you
that he never read your paper, (since he was
busy having an anxiety attack over his upcoming tenure review,) but only threw them down a
flight of stairs and gave the top step "A's." He
then explains that he gave you a "B+" final
grade not because you didn't earn an "A," but
because he had already fulfilled his "A" quota
and was afraid the department would think he
was a wuss if he gave you one, too.
Well, we're seniors, and we know that this
honesty simply will not happen at Swat. At least
not in the next six weeks. After that, who cares?
Our gripe is with all this other dishonest #%*s
that we get in our mailboxes. It comes in by the
truckload. We're convinced that if grad
schools/employers actually were honest with
you, your rejection letters) would look more

couldn't we have graduated in the hey-day of

Svelte Redhead Falls For a Latin Libido

Call it a cross between Boyz N the Hood and
Sleepless in Seattle. Call it a tale of doomed
love and inner-city violence. Call it whatever

see Jason's Lyric.
In the interviews included with the videotape, the director and producer inform us that
Jason'sLyric is supposed to be a look at the life
of an African-American "working stiff—somewhere in between The Cosby Show and
Juice.But if the filmmakers ever ha<
any instincts toward realism,
they've been swamped by tendencies for lurid violence and thoroughly dopey romanticism. Jason (Allen
Payne) may start out as an average
guy, but as soon as Lyric (Jada
Pinkett) shows up, things quickly
start getting pretentious. She invites
him to meet her "when the sun next
leaves footprints across the sky."
She quotes John Donne at the
drop of a hat, and (at least in
the "special sexy unrated" version, which I was lucky
enough to rent) makes love to
him in a field of flowers.
As nauseating as this sounds
(and trust me, it's worse), it's
not nearly as repugnant as the subplot involving
Jason's brother Josh (Bokeem Woodbine). A
prototypical Bad Seed, Josh has been in and out
of jail since he was old enough to hold a gun.
But with a dead father and a seemingly ineffectual mother, it's Jason's job to keep him out of
trouble. Unsurprisingly, he fails. Josh gets
involved in a bank robbery, which he bungles
by showing up late. This provides the excuse
for the guy who planned the robbery to take a
circular saw to Josh's chest, in what I would
call one of the most ridiculous scenes in the
film.
The climax comes late in the film, as Jasonis
forced to choose between Lyric and Josh—but
really, there's no need for you to stick around
that long. Incredibly amateurish acting, atrocious dialogue, pedestrian direction, and the
lack of anything remotely resembling a sense of
humor make Jason's Lyric a must-miss.

Divorce Movie Misses
By David Rich

What's

Bye Bye Love is a new film about what it means to be a divorced man seeing your kids every
film stars Matthew Modine, Randy Quaid, and Paul Reiser as the three
fathers who are the focus of the movie. Read this review understanding that I might just have
missed the whole point just because I'm not a divorced man with kids....
Vic (Quaid), Donny (Reiser), and David (Modine) are best friends who also happen to be
divorced fathers who meet at McDonald's every Friday to pick up their kids from their ex-wives.
The film follows their adventures with their kids and their lives over a typical weekend. And that
is the first three-quarters of the movie, folks. There's nothing more to this film until the Night
from Hell occurs. This is the night where everybody's life goes down the drain all at once:
Donny's, David's, Vic's, and some of the kids'. Look for a terrific scene with Quaid and the wonderful Janeane Garafalo on the disaster/blind-date of a lifetime. (This date is so bad it makes
Highlander 111 look like Casablanca.)
If we wanted to take a real highbrow Swattie look at the film, we could see the three men as
different aspects of a typical divorced man; but, it's better if we just consider them as three different reactions to divorce. David is the one who reacts by trying to sleep with every woman he
meets (including the divorced moms on his kid's soccer team) while being in a relationship with
another woman; he is terrified of commitment, which is the same thing that ruined his marriage.
Vic is angry. No, I'm serious. Vic is really angry. He hates his ex, he hates her boyfriend and her
parents, and he hates the doctor (hilariously portrayed by Rob Reiner) on theradio who preaches about divorce. He goes so far as to demolish the porch he built solely because his ex's
boyfriend was sitting on it
Donny is the one in denial; he hasn't given up hope that he and his ex will get back together—even though she's remarried. The film is trying to show us that there are all kinds of reactions to
divorce by serious men of the nineties... or at least three.
The film is not a complete disaster; there are some good performances and some very funny
parts (the blind date slayed me). Reiser demonstrates thathe really is a good actor, even in a lousy
film. Quaid is outrageous, and Modine does what he's good at., standing around, looking good.
Garafalo, though, does what she did for Reality Bites —that is, she shines in an otherwise forgettable film.
The movie takes too long showing us what divorce is like. There is a real feeling that nothing
will be resolved in the film; these characters will go on existing as they always have in their various states of divorce. Then, the Night From Hell occurs and provides for potential disasters and
lots of conflict. The movie goes on to a real "StarTrek" ending.In the 'Trek" TV shows, the first
55 minutes are spent creating an incredibly stressful situation for the crew, then the last five are
for the quick wrap-up to everything. This movie takes the first three-quarters to get to the stress
and then solves it all in the last twenty-five minutes.
The movie is just... okay. There are some very funny things, but it is otherwise forgettable,
although it does remind us that, "Yes, everyone has a right to water." It should be rented and
watched on the small screen. If Luke were here, he'd say, "I've got a bad feeling about this..." (2).

Business as Usual
By lan Bricke

of

I'm not a strong swimmer, the full-length debut of Philadelphia area trio Day Reckoning,
serves up a well-crafted helping of catchy straight-ahead punk pop. The only problem here is that
it's been done before—many times before. Swimmer's best tracks, "Feel the Space,"
"Firecracker," and "Down to Earth," stay close to the band's influences, blending Replacementsstyle punk and the usual grunge guitar heroics. When the band tries to shift gears, theresults are
less successful. "Stay Loose" is a distinctly unfunky attempt at hard-rock boogie (complete with
cheesy Hammond organ and a really stupid
chorus). "Run" is a rather nondescript i
acoustic ballad. Singer, songwriter, and J
guitarist Michael DeCastro has a service- I
able voice, and he switches with ease m
between crunchy power chords and more m
complex melodic lines. His lyrics manage fl
to be both quirky and anthem-like, fl

fl

"Revelation" and "Clockwork") slip fl
fl
into generic alternative-rock angst.
This album makes a pretty convinc- fl
ing case for Day of Reckoning's repu- fl
tation as a first-rate live act—the band fl
obviously has the chops and the ener- fl
gy needed to put on a great show, fl
With the addition of a little creativi- fl
ty, they could become more than fl
another standard issue rock act. I'm fl
not a strong swimmer isn't bad, it's fl
just very familiar.
Of course, if you liked this the
first few hundred times you heard it,
you'll probably like it again.

The men's lacrosse team triumphed
over CabriniCollege 12-3 last Satur-

day in a game marred by poor sportsmanship by Cabrini. A fourth quarter that included many cheap late
hits, unnecessary penalties, and even
racial remarks took attention away
from the Garnet's biggest margin of
victory in two years. The muchneeded win was the first of the year,
bringing therecord to date to 1-3.
The Garnet dominated almost all
aspects of the game throughout the
contest, highlighted by the team's
ability to control the ball. The offense was able to score whilerunning
many different offenses. Ben Seigel
'96 said, "The team played with a
high level of confidence. We were
able to settle down on offense and
take control of the game. Also, the
defense cleared very well, creating

Indeed, for the first time this year,
Swarthmore'soffense took the game.
Leading the onslaught was midfielder
Dave Martinez '96, who poured in

three big goals. Cary Schaub '95,
Kevin Aldrick '95, Brian Dougherty
'95, Andy Place '96,Eric Griffin'96,
and Dave Sturtevant '96 all also had
a hand in the scoring. While the score
could have been much higher with
improved shooting, thefact thatmany
scoring opportunities arose indicates
the growth of the offense during the
past year. The offense should be
complete by the time the tougher
conference foes come around.
The defense also played a strong
game, almost completely shutting
down any offense Cabrini brought
with them. The three goals allowed
were ten below the previous average
this year. Yet statistics don't tell the
whole story from the defensive standpoint. The Garnetconstantlystripped
the best Cabrini attackmen. Goalie
Ben Henwood '97 was able to stop
Whatever shots the Cavaliers were
able to get off, Henwood finished
with 13 saves, including two pointblank shots early in the first quarter.
One negative result occurred when
starting defenseman and co-captain
Shannon Brown '95 was lost to a
season-ending injury as a result of a
cheap late hi t by aCabriniattackman.
The Garnet looks to build on this
victory in their game against Tufts

should be a excellent, hard-hitting

Baseball

Despite taking a reduced squad to
the Washington and Lee Invitational
this past weekend, Swat track and
field still turned in more than respectable performances. Because of
thefive-hour driving timerequired to
get to W&L, head track coach Ted
Dixon decided to only take one van
load of athletes to Lexington, Virginia.
Especially noteworthy were the
performances of the only two women
on the trip. Kate Dempsey '95 and
Jill Wildonger '97 combined for 20
points in a very competitive field of
11 teams. Dempsey won the open
800 handily, kicking down the
stretch to beatAll-American Yvonne
Barnes of Williams College.
Wildonger ran a 1:02.49 in the open
400. to take third place, and took two
seconds offher personal best for the
open 200 to take fourth place overall in a time of 27.64 sec.
The lone two points for the men
came from a somewhat surprising
fifth-place finish in the 1500 by
Kerry Boeye '97, with a time of
4:14.61.
Though they didn't score, the men
also recorded some performances of
note: Eric Walton '97 putted his best
mark in the outdoor shot ever with a
distance of 39'6". Frank Amar '96
and Walid Gellad '97 took two and
one seconds off their 400 splits
respectively in the 4x400m relay,
while Sam Paschel '96 ran his best

Women's
Lacrosse
After a long preseason, the aggressive Swarthmore women's lacrosse
team showed that they were ready to
play in their first game on Tuesday,
defeating the College ofNotre Dame
of Maryland by a score of 21-7.
The Garnet started out the game
slowly, letting up two goals in the
opening minutes of play. This was
the wake-up call thatthe team needed,
however, and by halftime. Swat had

secured a 14-5 lead. In this superb
demonstration of offensive power,
the team was led by the outstanding
play of several of it's talented scorers. Co-captain Julie Noyes '95
scored eight goals and two assists
and Lia Ernst '97 scored four goals
and one assist. Lara Ewens '96 and
Laura Starita'96 both recorded three
goals and one assist and Kristen
Osborne'97 and co-captain Headier
Maloney '95 each scored one goal
and one assist. In addition, Ch'uya
Hornberger '97 scored one goal, and
Bess O'Neil '95 contributed an assist. Jill Maybee '96 performed well
in goal, recording a grand total of 13
saves on the day.
With a perfect record of 1-0 on the
season, the women's lacrosse team
has high hopes for the rest of the
spring season. They are continuing
with a crowded schedule this weekend. They will play two homegames,
facing Washington College on Saturday and Lynchburg College on Sunday.

Men's
Tennis
Two months ago the men's tennis
marked a garnet circle around
this weekend on their schedules.
Many players muttered hurriedly
under their breaths, "The Atlanta
trip," rabidly anticipating the three
day southern excursion. Now, five
matches into the season, the
tennismen face their most gruelling
weekend in recent memory. Three
days, three matches, three nationally
ranked opponents. Today, the Garnet men face host school Emory.
Tomorrow they take on '92 and '93
Division 111 national champions
Kalamazoo, and on Sunday they finish against perennial powerhouse
Trinity of Texas. All three matches
will be held at Emory University in
Atlanta.
Going into theweekend showdown
the Garnet have posted a respectable
3-2 record while playing only Division I and II opponents. Last Saturday the team fell to Georgetown 5-2.
The tennis men came out flat, losing
the preliminary doubles matches
without much vigor. The singles
matches were fiercely contested
though, as each team tried to adjust to
their first outdoor match of the season. The Garnet, who boast an uncharacteristically experienced squad,
proved their depthby winning at number four and number six singles. Chris
Ciunci '95, gutted out a thrilling two
set match 7-6, 7-5, and the indomitable Roger Werner '9B, won a three
set battle for a win in his first start for
the Garnet.
The matches in Atlanta this weekend are particularly important because they mark the beginning of the
Garnet'sDivision!!! schedule, which
includes Williams and Amherst at
home next weekend. "We'd like to
go down and get a couple wins in
Atlanta," explained John Derdarian
'97. "It's going to be tough playing
three matches in a row, but that's
why you run the hard windsprints in
January and go to bed early on the
weekends."

Zengerle on the Thrills and Chills of March Madness
By Jason Zengerle

The East: Going into the Tournament, no team was playing better

Who cares that Michael Jordan's
back? Sure, it's a nice story, and it's
good to see the greatest player ever
back out on the court, but now that
it's March, there are other pressing
matters. Those matters, of course,
are the NCAA Men's Basketball
Tournament
Has there ever been a more exciting first and secondround than this
year's? I'm sure that's said every
year, but that's only because each

Has there ever been
a more exciting first
and second round?

year seems to surpass the previous.
Six overtime games.Four incredible
upsets. Three last-second, game-winning shots. It was an incredible four
days. Now it's time for four more
days of non-stop action, and then it's
on to Seattle. Who's going to make it
to the Final Four? Let's look at it
region by region.

than Wake Forest. Randolph
Childress, their senior point guard,
hadone of themost phenomenal ACC
Tournaments ever, and their 6'11"
sophomore center Tim Duncan was a
force to be reckoned with. Well, the
Deacons looked a bit ragged in their
first two games of the regionals, and
I think that they'll have a difficult
time making it out of the Meadowlands to Seattle. In the regional semifinal Wake should handle a good
Oklahoma State team, with Duncan
neutralizing the 7'o" monstrosity
Bryant "Big Country" Reeves. They
will likely then get to play a streaking
UMass squad, who should have little
problem with an over achieving Tulsa
in the other semifinal.
The Minutemen, with their extremely talented front-line, will give
theDeacons problems. WhileDuncan
is an excellent player, he's going to
havehis handsfull with 6*11" sophomore Marcus Camby, and Lou Roe,
the Minutemen's All-American senior power forward, will also behard
to stop. If the UMass guards can
make a minimal contributionand keep
Childress just somewhat in check,
look for Jon Calipari's club to be in
Seattle.
The West: UCLA's miraculous
last-second victory over Missouri
might have been justwhat theBruins
needed. Every team needs a good
scare on the way to the title, and this
might have just been theirs. Their
third-round opponent Mississippi

State is an unheraldedbut strong club,
but UCLA will likely prove too tough.
The other third round game, Connecticut vs. Maryland, has all the
makings of a great one. Connecticut
has looked to be among thebest teams
in the field in their first two games,
but throughout the season they dem-

onstrated an inability to play good
interior defense. Look for thatproblem to hauntthem againstMaryland.
The Terps have just enough talent in
the back-court, with Johnny Rhodes
and Duane Simpkins, to neutralize
the Huskies' Kevin Ollie and Doron
Scheffer, and Exree Hipp will keep
Huskie sophomore sensation Ray
Allen in check at the small forward
spot. It's at center that Maryland will
dominate, with 6'10" All-America
Joe Smith eating up the much-butnot-that-improved Travis Knight.
The regional final game between
UCLA and the Terps should be a
good one, but Maryland is a little too
thin and down the stretch theBruins
will likely pull away. The Bruins
match-up well againstMaryland, and
any damage Joe Smith might cause
will surely be undone by the havoc
Ed O'Bannonwreaks on Maryland.
The Midwest: This is the weakest
of the regions and probably the least
enjoyable to watch. I mean, who
wants to watch Kansas? That said,
Kansas should dispatch Virginia in
their meeting. The interesting story
in this region is the defending nationalchampion Arkansas, who have
been in a deep slumber all season. A
one-point first round victory over

Texas Southern and a gift victory
over Syracuse in the second round
were not pretty, but the Razor backs
might just be too talented to blow
this. Memphis will give them a good
run in theirregional semifinalmatch,
but Arkansas should outlast them.
The Razorbacks then will face a
challenge: playing Kansas on the
Jayhawks' quasi-home court at
Kemper Arena. Maybe this sort of
obstacle will be enough to shake Arkansas from their lethargy. Maybe
facing the likes of Jacques Vaughn
and Greg Oostertag will inspire
Corliss Williamson and Scotty
Thurman to play at the level they
played at in last year's tournament. I
think it will and that's why I expect
we'll be seeing Arkansas in Seattle.
Southeast: Rivalling the West Region for most talentis the Southeast.
Picking a clear-cut favorite out of
this bunch is not an easy task. Kentucky has been on a tear for the past
two weeks and there is little chance
that Arizona State is going to derail
them. Kentucky simply has too much
fire-power. The intriguing game of
the thirdround is the classic North
Carolina vs. Georgetown match-up.
Carolina, who after a shoddy first
round performance and a shaky firsthalf against lowa State in the second
round, rounded into form and showed
why they can be considered one of
the top teams in the country. When
Jerry Stackhouse and Rasheed
Wallace are clicking, there are few
teams that can
stop them.
Georgetown, on the other hand,

played two horrible games against
weaker opponents, but advanced to
the Sweet Sixteen on a Don Reid
(who could not catch, much less tip
with accuracy when he came to
Georgetown three years ago) putback at the buzzer against might
Weber State. Can Georgetownbeat
Carolina? Probably not, but the Hoy as
are a young team who often play to
the level of their opponents, and I
think they'll give theTarheels a good
run. They match up well against Dean
Smith's club and if Allen Iverson
shakes some of his tournament jitters
and plays withinhimself, Georgetown
has a shot.
That said, look for Carolina to advance and play Kentucky. In a thriller
of a game Rasheed Wallace will prove
too much for the front-line of Kentucky and theTarheels will be Seattle
bound.
Final Thought: Now that I've laid
out my Final Four, I thought I'd make
talk about the most interesting game
of the first two rounds: Syracuse vs.
Arkansas. Syracuse's Lawrence
Moten, perhaps one of the smartest
players incollege basketball, fellprey
to reflexes in signalling for a timeout when his team didn't have one.
The problem is, the official never
shouldhave issued the time-out. The
Syracuse player on the floor with the
ball, Lucious Jackson, did not have
possession of the ball. An Arkansas
player was grabbing for the ball and
theplay was up in the air. A time-out
can only be taken if a team has
possession... and Syracuse did not.

Buzzards Begin
Spring Season with
Shutout over York
By Jen Philpott
Did you

ever stop and

wonder

why so many Swatties play rugby

why they love it so much? Why
is it that the men's team prides themselves on being known as the Evil
Buzzards? What keeps bringing
these men back to the sport despite
injury after injury? Perhaps we can
gain a bit of insight from a key
upperclassman rugby player, Justin
McLean '95 on why he loves rugby:
"I love the hitting both tackling
others and getting tackled. There's
something exhilarating about
smacking into someone full speed
without any pads between you!"
Aside from the hitting and sweat
(and beer), there is a great deal of
strategy, training, competition, and
struggle involved in rugby. Every
season, the captains are responsible
for training a group ofSwatties with
varying schedules and levels ofability into a rugby team that can be
competitive. Swarthmore's men's
rugby team is not coached by anyone other than its captains, Mike
Madden '95 and Darin Friess '95
who coach the forwards and the
backs, respectively. These two extremely dedicated men have apparently been managing well so far this
season they picked up their first
win against York CollegelastSaturday.
The final score in thegamewas 70, but Swarthmore dominated the
field throughout the 80 minutes of
play. Adam "Zulu Warrior" B lescia
'97 scored his first A side try and
Chaz Teplin '96 made the conversion to bring the score up to 7. The
try was scored after a few kicks, and
there was key support from Justin
McLean '95 and MarkPletcher '96.
The back line played together for

full back, Chris Marin '96 at wing
and, in his A side debut, Dan Barrick

are looking forward to the rest of the
season with high hopes. The back
line is being led by experienced fly
halfs Friess and Teplin who are excited about the addition ofSchwan at
inside center because he is an excellent tackier and provides a link to the
forwards (he was previously a
flanker). Despite losing some very
valuableplayers to study abroad, the
restof the backline is looking strong.
The experience of Sturm, Pletcher,
and Marin, combined with the speed
and dedication of Blescia and Barrick,
have the promise of making a lot of
good plays this season. In support,
several excellent rookies are showing plenty of potential. It seems as
though the wrestlers on the team have
recruited from close to home Curtis
Trimble '96 (wrestler) already
knocked a York player unconscious
and is looking strong, and Alec
"Chemocut" Stall '9B (wrestler) is
demonstrating speed to match some
of the fastest players on the team.

Dave McCulley '96, and Sean
Mcßride '96 are also working hard
and showing great potential. Matt
Jacobson '97 has been leading the B
side and is invaluable to the team
On the forward side of things,
Madden runs the show. In fact, according to Teplin, "He is our main
coach and our leader on and off the
field. At eight man he seems to win
the rucks in most situations and is
getting the team to be more coordinated offensively using both thebacks
and the forwards together in the attack." Dougal and Ellingsonprovide
a great deal of experience, depth, and
leadership to the forward pack. A
recent addition to Swat and to the
'Zards is Walker, a transfer student,
who is an experienced player and has
been a blessing for the team, despite
an injury early in the season. The
tight five has been given strength and
size due to the abilities of Dave
Plastino, James Tracy, and Mike
Topodas '95. Chris Jahnke '97 has
been shuffled around the pack a few

times, always playing hard; this time
he is learning to play hooker and
doing a fine job. John Fiorello '9B,
another wrestling conquest, was persuaded to play rugby and is looking
very strong as are Joe Khan '97, Scott
Friesen '97, and Bryan Berg '97.
NOTE- If you find yourself mystified by the rugby lingo, then you
obviously have not been to enough
games and you should come and
broaden your vocabulary on Saturday at Dupont Field at 1:30.

Women's Tennis Starts Season
Strong in Quest for Nationals

Rani Shankar '9B gets ready to serve at practice this week. Rani won her singles
match In Vie women tennis team's recent victory over Averett In Hilton Head, SC.
Swat also beat Mary Washington, Catholic University and Washington University.

Spring is in the air and the tennis
balls are flying. The Swarthmore
women's tennis team has been practicing hard inside the fieldhouse since
they returned from winterbreak. The
team had their first chance to move
outdoors into the fresh air over spring
break when they traveled to Hilton
Head, SC. With four successful
matchesunder theirbelts, the women
are ready and excited for their spring
line-up of tough matches.
The team was blessed with beautiful weather on Monday when they
faced Guilford, their first team of the
week. For the first match of the
spring season, the team competed
very well against the skilled Guilford
team. Becca Kolasky '96andAyonda
Nteta '95 played three grueling sets
each, turning in great performances
at #1 and #2 singles respectively.
Unfortunately, Swat was unable to
prevail, succumbing to an overall
score of 2-7. MichelleMartinez '97,
with solid and consistent play at #4
singles, produced the only singles
win of the match. The outstanding
doubles team of Kolasky and Nteta
produced an impressive win that
marked the beginning of an undefeated week for them.
After the Guilford match, the Garnet travelled to meet Averett Coach
Dan Sears was able to give the underclassmen the benefit of his experi-

The team finished theweek against
Washington University and lifted
their overall spring break record to 41. Crusey again played an excellent
match at #1 singles, winning the first
set 7-6 and sealing the match in the
second, 6-3. Kolasky and Nteta both
won their singles matches and then

CharityMiller '9B, and Kori Bell '9B
completed the singles line-up with
solid victories. Shankar turned in an
excellent performance at #2 singles
and Rosenbaum fought hard to prevail in three sets.
The team faced Catholic University on Tuesday, sweeping the match
9-0. Singles players Crusey, Kolasky,
Nteta, Becky Katz '95, Martinez '97,
and Hilary Gehlbach '96 all played
solidly with Gehlbach winning in
three sets. The doubles teams of
Crusey and Katz, Kolasky and Nteta,
as well as Martinez and Gehlbach
were all successful. The impressive
play of Kolasky and Nteta continued
what would be an undefeated week.
The following day Swat faced
MaryWashington, whichis its toughest competitor and the 13thranked
team in Division HI team. Winning
at singles were Kolasky, Nteta, and
Katz. Swat entered doubles competition tied at 3-3. Kolasky and Nteta

Coach Sears commented, 'The
week was a very successful one for
the whole team. We played well and
can hopefully use that as we head into
the regular season." The women
opened the season against Franklin

the memory of a great spring break
and the week and a half of outdoor
the women look towards the season

Hood Trophy:History, Honor, Humiliating Haverford
By David Lischer

I've heard enough talk about
Haverford andSwarthmore being two
of the top liberal arts colleges in the
nation. We all work hard and experience great stress, but we're adult
enough not to argue over which college is the better academic institution. Besides it's really not cool to
argue over whose school is harder or
who has the greater work load.
It's logical, then, that we find a
more mature outlet for our youthful,
competitive spirit. The obvious
choice is athletics. The rules of the
Haverford-Swarthmorerivalry are the
same as those between any two
archrivals. Defeating Haverford can
turn a bleak, winless season into a

Defeating Haverford
can turn a bleak,
winless season into a
success while a loss
to Haverford can mar
an otherwise outstanding season.
What is the Hood Trophy? A ran-

dom poll of studentswould show that
about a quarter know what the Hood

Trophy is.This is far too few for such
an important symbol of the athletic
rivalry between Haverford andSwarthmore Colleges. The college with
the most athletic victories over the
other each year wins the large silver
Reverebowl known as the HoodTrophy.

What shouldthe Hood Trophy be?
Ideally, it should be a comfort and
rallying point to overworked student-

athletes and theirfriends. If you're in
a bad mood, it can serve as a basis for
derogatory remarks toward our lovable neighbors.
What the Hood Trophy isn't It's
not awarded to the best body during
the Parrish dash-for-cash. It's also
not a comfort and rallying point to

student-athletes and their friends.
Considering its rich history, however, it should be.
The contest was first held in 1941
42 in honor of AlbertL. Hood, Jr., a
Swarthmore graduate, and his efforts
to "improve the spirit ofathletic competition between the two colleges."
Much of Hood's family, including
his older sister, attendedSwarthmore
over the years. After his sister married a Haverford football captain,
Hood was introduced to many friends
in the Haverford community. In 1926,
while Hood was still an undergraduate at Swarthmore, the athletic rivalry between Swat and Haverford
was discontinued.. Through his writing for The Phoenix, Hood initiated
steps to rekindle the rivalry.
Haverford and Swarthmore no
longer compete against one another
in football. In fact, Haverford no
longer has a football team, nor do
they have acounterpart to theGamet's

After the fall and winter seasons
this year, the Swarthmore Garnet
holds a commanding 6-3 lead over
Haverford. One point is awarded for
each victory; however, if two games
are played in a sport, a half-point is
awarded for each.
In the fall, the women's teams in
field hockey, soccer, and volleyball
earned points for the Garnet; while
Haverford was victorious in men's
soccer, and both men's and women's
cross-country. It was a winter wonderlandfor the Garnet as they swept
wrestling and
all varsity sports
men's and women's basketball (two
games each) in the winter season.
Haverford has held that wonderful
large silver Revere bowlfor two years.
The Garnet's campaign to win back
the trophy lies depends on the spring
teams who must hold the lead. The
Garnet will clinch the trophy if they
earn only two points this spring.
There are six remaining points up
for grab: baseball, men's and
women's lacrosse, women's tennis
and men's and women's track. The
Garnet can claim no sure points in
any of these sports.
Women's lacrosse and women's
tennis look to have the best shots at

sion on the field competing for possession of the large, silver Revere
bowl. Just remember, we all know
the only reason Haverford can compete is that they have more free time.

Whenyou think of men's rugby on
this campus, several names may pop
to mind, and Justin (Nugget, as the
team refers to him) is surely one of
them. Justin has played rugby for
four years here and has six complete
seasons of experience. He says,
"I played lacrosse for two years here
as well. I loved it but nothing can
compare to rugby running for 80
minutes without any timeouts, no
pads, just the 15 ofyou against them,
hurting like crazy but not giving in
'cause you don't want to let your
teammates down. Nothing comes
close!"

It is unusual for The Phoenix to
choose co-athletes of the week but
these two women tennis players deserve it. Becca and Ayonda formed
the #1 doubles team that was the
driving force behind the team while
competing in Hilton Head, SC over
spring break. Together they were
undefeated winning all four of their
matches against stiff competition.
Individually, their outstanding performances seemed to mirror each

truly essential element of our team
who can provide on-the-field inspiration with his excellent individual
play." Justin was named MVP in the

the week, both went on to win the rest
of their singles matches, compiling
records of 3-1 each. Becca and
Ayonda hope to help lead the team in
a winning season and an eventual trip
to Nationals. "Ayonda and Becca
work so well together as a team; they
combine power and finesse, complementing each other's games. I love
to watch them play." said teammate
Charity Miller '9B.
