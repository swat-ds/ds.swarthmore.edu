Former senator

BY JON EHRENFELD
Former Democratic senator Robert Kerrey gave a

was retirementand health security, the former senator
from Nebraska addressed a wide number of topics and
shaped his speech to fit the audience.

Acceptance rate rises for 2005
BY GABRIEL HETLAND
Nearly 900 high school seniors
from around the country and the
world are opening their mail this
week to find "the fat one"
an acceptance letter
from Swarthmore.
Out of a total applicant pool of more
than 3,500 people, 889 were admitted
to the college, an acceptance rate of
about 25 percent.
One hundred forty-nine students
were accepted as early decision candidates, up significantly from past
years. Acting Dean of Admissions
Jim Bock said that this was due to
more early decision applications,
about 300 of them. As in past years,
the acceptance rate of early-decision
candidates stands at 50 percent.
Overall, this year's applicant pool
is down in numbers from last year's
number of more than 4,000. Admissions office personnel expected that
the number would be down somewhat, partly due to the press received
following the decision to cut football
last December.
But Bock said that most of the decline in applications is not due to re-

dents, it seems to have had little deterrence affect in the past. The big difference this year, said Bock, is that the
lower acceptance rate among international students was posted on the
Internet in the "Frequently Asked Questions" part of Swarthmore's admissions
Web page. Bock believes that more students applying from abroad saw this and
chose not to apply this year.
Bock said thefootball decision did not
have as bit of an impact on applicants
as it could have because ofthe decision's
timing. The board of managers made
their decision in December and "by that
time most people had already sent in
their applications," Bock said
About a dozen applicants asked to be
removed after hearing about the decision, Bock said, adding that the football
decision seemed to have the most affect

on local and regional applications,

where

publicity was greatest. In general, however, the application rate seemed to have
been affected very little, said Bock.
It is possible that the yield of students
could change based on the press from the
football decision, Bock conceded. Some

sponse to the football decision but to
a lower rate of application among in-

Despite the lower application rate
and questions about football, Bock said
he was "delighted" by this year's admitted class. "The quality of students we've
admitted is just as good as it's always
been," said Bock.
According to the Admitted Class of
2005 Report, 38 percent of the admitted
class are valedictorians or salutatorians.
Fifty-six percent are in the top two percent, and 91 percent in the top decile of
their graduating class. Bock said that
these numbers may have changed a percentage point or two, but are approximately the same as last year.
Fifty-seven percent of the admitted
class attended public high schools, 31
percent private; four percent were from
parochial schools and eight percent from
schools overseas. Bock believed these
patterns were similar to past years.
The percentage of admitted students
of color remained strong at 43 percent,
though falling slightly from last year's
figure of 45 percent. Asian Americans
continued to make up the largest percentage at 19 percent, with African
Americans 10 percent, Latino/a students
13 percent and one percent listed as "Native American/Hawaiian/Other."
Bock said that the yield of students
of color will probably bring the percentage of students of color who actually attend to about 33 percent, similar to the
class of 2004.

Though much of Kerrey's talk did revolve around
politics, he focused not on specific issues but on the
ethos behind political life. To illustrate this, he spoke
about the man who had asked him to speak at
Swarthmore: Eugene Lang '3B. Lang, he said, was a
waiter in the 1930s about to attend a local college when
a stranger provided for him to come to Swarthmore.
Kerrey viewed this type of ethic, in which people strive
to make a local impact, as his vision of the ideal state of
politics.
Kerrey did not often discuss the details of the
present political situation, but he did indicate in an
interview that although he is not entirely satisfied
with President Bush's performance, "he is my president as well." He feels that Bush has not been "the
unifier he promised to be" in his campaign. Kerrey
also opposes Bush's appointment of conservative Missourian John Ashcroft as Attorney General, as well
as Bush's tax cut, which Kerrey does not believe will
revitalize the economy.
Kerrey personally defined politics as simple human

interaction. As such, he said, "politics are everywhere
you go," offering an image of politics that contrasts the
negative connotations it usually carries.
One of the key ideas Kerrey brought up was the institution of a nationwide safety net. Social security, re-

tirement money and Medicare, he said, should be available to every American, legal or non-legal, and Americans should not be subject to the current maze of eligibility and restrictions. Kerrey claims this safety net will

eliminate problems such as the uninsuredpaying more
for prescription drugs.
At times, Kerrey stepped back even from the idea
of politics to dicuss democracy in general. A key elements of democracy that is often missed, he said, is
the need for people and nations to change habits. He
cited the current debate over global warming as an
example of a situation in which America must change
its ways in order to accommodate the reality of a situation.
"Don't expect democracy to be easy," he said.
Kerrey used the image of the men who died at the D-

invasion of Normandy as the ultimate example of
willingness to endure adverse situations in the name
of global change.
Kerrey indicated in his talk that much of his informality and choice of topics stem from the fact that he is

Panel to debate
state of war in
Sierra Leone
BY HOFAN CHAU
When Harriette Williams 'O3 arrived in the United
Statesfrom Sierra Leone, she was amazed to find that
few people knew about the rebel war that had been
tearing through the country for over a decade.
"Coming over here, it was a shock to realize that
people were so unaware of what was going on, so
unaware of Sierra Leone, a situation I consider one

Questions, accusations made during
Family Weekend parents' meeting
BY NICOLE BRUNDA
The President's Forum for Parents
became charged at two points on Saturday as parent and alumni members of
Mind the Light publicly criticized administrative decision-making processes
and accused officials of harboring and

carrying out secret agendas.
The forum was being conducted by

President Al Bloom, Provost Jennie
Keith and Dean of the College Bob Gross
as part of Family Weekend. Mind the
Light is an organization of various members of the Swarthmore community who
have drawn attention, by emphasizing
the decision-making process, to the
administration's decision in early December to cut footballand wrestling and

demote badminton.
A majority of the meeting flowed
smoothly, with questions ranging from
temporary faculty and the foreign study
program to the credit/no-credit policy
and faculty evaluation, said those in attendance. Approximately two-thirds of
the way through the meeting, several
concerned parents also sought further
information about the December decision to cut football.
In an interview Tuesday, Bloom said
that, with the exception of one interruption during the session and one incident
after, the dialogue was positive and productive. He felt those parents who asked
about the decision wanted to better understand it and to help their children get
over their disappointment.
The confrontational part ofthe meeting consisted of two emotional outbursts, one by a Swarthmore parent,
who confronted Bloom and subsequently left the auditorium, and the

4

other by an attending alumnus who, after the session had ended, became very
emotionaland confrontedBloom.
Both speakers accused Bloom ofmaking the decision to cut football long before the Athletic Review Committeewas
conceived of in 1999. Bloom said these
accusations were not true.
In a subsequent interview, Dave
Rowley '65, a member ofMind the Light
who attended Saturday's panel but was
not involved in the confrontation, said
members ofhis group "believe and have
documentation that we feel proves the
decision to cut football was made long
before the ARC process began. The Athletic Review Committee was a thinly
veiled way of legitimizing the decision
by President Bloom to cut football."
Rowley said that many parent and
alumni members are more concerned with
the larger issues of governance of the college and the lack of consensus and open
discussion in the decision-making process.
"The college is not about the president and certain key donors who have
an image of what the college should be
like," he explained. "It is aboutall groups
and members of the community, and decisions should be made accordingly."
None of the panelists' opening remarks contained significant mention of
the athletic cuts, though Bloom did make
reference to the "decision to consolidate
the sports program."
Bloom expressed disappointment in
the confrontations, especially the second,
which came not from a parent, for whom
the session was intended, but rather
from an attending alumnus after the session had been closed to questions.
"I am disappointed that an alum
would take advantage of a parents' event

THE PHOENIX

to forward his agenda, and I hope very
much that we can move beyond the ten-

sions he and other alums feel," he said.
But Rowley, along with fellow Mind
the Light member Bill Robinson '6O and
Robert Melick 'O3, vice chair of the Student Mindthe Light Group, stressed that
their organization would not be dying
down any time soon.
"Mind the Light is getting to be a
stronger organization every day,"
Rowley said, "and we will continue to
make ourselves known at graduation,
alumni day and other college meetings
until we get the college administration
to face up to the fact that theirdecisionmaking process is flawed."
Many parents were upset with the
way certain Mind the Light members
had altered the flow of the meeting and
prevented them from asking questions
on other topics.

"Football parents were very disrespectful, and that was very uncomfortable for me," said Cynthia Byers, whose
daughter is in the class of 2004. "While
they may have had a point to make, they
made it in an inappropriate way.
"To shout and call names and accuse
President Bloom of being a liar was completely unacceptable of parents," she continued, adding, "It was a very, very unfortunate ending to a meeting that
should have been informative."
"Healing is not an easy process, and I
view it as a very passive and ineffective
one," saidMelick. He saidMindthe Light
plans to "continue to actively fight to
make the college admit accountability."
The ramifications of the December decision "will last forever," saidMelick. "The
students' healing process, in my opinion,
will never be completely realized."

emy."
Among the speakers will be ambassador John
Leigh, Sierra Leone's liaison to the United States. He
will discuss the role of the Sierra Leonean government and the international community. Leigh will
be joined by Isha Dyfan, a political activist in asy-

lum, who will talk about the role of women in the
war. Professor William Reno, from Northwestern
University, will speak on "warlord politics" and the
political economy. Together with Jimmy Kendeh, a
political science professor from the University of
Richmond, he will lend a more academic analysis to
the situation.
Williams will talk about her experiences in Sierra
Leone, including her escape from Freetown withher
family when rebels entered the city. Gilpin-Jackson's
concerns are directed on how help could be given
directly to those affected. "The girls who have been
systematically raped and haveAIDS... how could we
provide psychological counseling and help?" she
asked. "For mothers and children who have their
limbs mutilated, what is theirfuture and how do we
create their future for them?"
Both Williams and Gilpin-Jackson hope to raise
awareness about the situation. "I feel that this is
something that needs to be known," Williams said.
Some day, students "might be in positions to make
decisions," she said.
Though Williams feels depressed that she is not
able to portray her country in the best light, at the
same time she emphasises the resilience of her
people. "It's been over ten years and they still have
hope. Sierra Leoneans have always had the ability
they've been able to go through
to bounce back
this and survive in some kind of way," she said. Williams hopes thather presentation and discussion will
look toward the future.
For those who consider the plight of a West African nation remote, Williams points out numerous ways in which the Western world has exacerbated the situation. Diamonds, smuggled and sold
in the West, fund the rebels' trafficking of arms.
Under a current law, the last port of departure,
instead of the location of the mining, is declared
as the origin of the diamonds. Buyers, if they care
at all, are thus deceived as to the impact their purchases may have.
Williams is also upset about "countries that push
for laws and have no clue on what's going on, espe-

At Monday night's Student Council meeting, members
decided to endorse a proposal which would hire at least one
professional shuttle driver during the night next year. Colin
Moore 'O2, council co-chair, reported that the College Budget Committee had included money for professional shuttle
drivers in its budget for next year.
"Larry Schall is willing to pay for it," he said, referring
to the college's vice president of facilities and services.
Moore said, however, that after talking to several nighttimestudent drivers, "pretty much the universal opinion was
that they want to keep their jobs." Moore cited the high pay
scale and desirable hours that attract students to the job.
The council discussed several ways in whichprofessional
drivers could be hired without students losing their jobs. The
first proposal was for drivers to begin at midnight and drive
until 3 a.m., then be on call until 7 a.m. The employees would
then drive the morning shuttle until 9 or 10 a.m. The proposal, however, was not immediately accepted.
Moore said morning shuttle service will not be given
extra funding because it is "only a convenience, and not
about safety."
Marvin Barron 'O2, student groups advisor, then proposed
increasing student wages throughout the college in order to
institute higher pay scales in other jobs.
Liane Rice 'O3, appointments chair, disagreed. "I don't think
we should be waiting around for a subcommittee to increase
wages... and then see if [the shuttle drivers] stick around," she
said. "I think it's unfortunate for those people, but they can
find other jobs they enjoy. This is a safety issue."
Jordan Brackett 'Ol then proposed that the college hire
only one professional driver and have a second shuttle operated by students until 2 a.m. Peter Holm 'Ol suggested using the money that would have gone to pay for the first
shuttle and employing more students for the Marple and
Genuardi's shuttles. Most members, however, didn't seem
very interested in the idea.
"While I feel sympathetic," co-president Anna Woodiwiss
'O2 said, "we don't have an obligation to find them another
shuttle job."
Woodiwiss emphasized, however, that the proposal may
be only temporary. "This is not saying there will never be
any more shuttle-driving jobs," she said. "Next year will be
a trial run."
Woodiwiss proposed hiring two drivers who would both
drive until 3:00 a.m. After that, one would be on foot patrol,
and the other would be on call. While Public Safety is currently on call for students who need transportation, the council members agreed that the service was little used, mostly
because students don't want to burden the safety officers.

Barron then brought up again the idea ofhaving professionals drive from 2 a.m. to 10 a.m., with the Student Budget Committee covering the cost ofthe salary during the morning shuttle
hours. Then, as an afterthought, he said, "Why don't we just
stick someone in a Diahatsu with a cell phone?"
Many of the council members agreed with the idea, and
Moore said he would present it to Schall when he meets with
him later this week. Moore said that he would also propose
that the professionals drive from 2 a.m. to 10 a.m., but that
the council would accept the original 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. as a
second choice.

SBC budget announced
During the Student Budget Committee report, Barron announced that SBC had received requests of $401,000 for student groups funding next year and had allocated $350,000 to
the groups as a whole. The final report, including the specific amounts for each student group, will be announced at
next week's student council meeting.
Barron raised a constitutional question about whether
Student Councilhad final say over whether a group gets funding. If a group is denied their requested funding, they can
appeal specifically to the Student Budget Committee. If they
are denied again, they can appeal directly to the council under the new constitution. But since the final budget will have
already been approved by SBC, the council would effectively
be directing SBC to fund a group without telling it where to
get the money.
After discussion over how to handle such an appeal—which
has never occurred Peter Holm 'Ol read the pertinent sectionsfrom the constitution. The council decided it had powers
only of recommendation, and thus a funding appeal from a group
could only be recommended to SBC by the council.

Brainstorming
Sonal Bhatia 'O2, campus relations representative, proposed that the college attempt to negotiate car rentals for
students, since most rental businesses would only rent to
students over 25 years of age.
Several council members pointed out that the rentals
would stillbe restricted to students over 21 years old. Lauren
Tobias 'O2, the council's campus life representative, suggested
that the college purchase its own vehicles and then rent them
out to students.
Barron was hesitant about the idea. "This is huge," he
said. Such an arrangement would necessitate the hiring of
more maintenance personnel, since he said they were "at
capacity" in dealing withthe existing college-owned vehicles.
Rice suggested that the college offer driving courses. She
proposed organizing it through the college itself or through
"whatever private company the high school uses."

ACADEMICS
Students find PDCs
futile, distribution
requirements fair
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
Most Swarthmore students do not find primary distribution
courses effective, according to three focus-group discussions and
a survey conducted by the college's Council on Educational Policy
(CEP). They do, however, generally find the three-course requirement for each academic division acceptable.
This semester, CEP, which is headed by Provost Jennie Keith
and includes six faculty members, three students and the president, has expanded its investigation on the current state of distribution requirements at the college and is deliberating possible
methods of improvement.
From the ideas of 35 students, communicated through the focus
groups and a campus-wide survey that CEP asked Student Council to create, "three broad conclusions came forth loud and clear,"
said Peter Holm 'Ol, Student Council's representative on CEP.
Most students do not think the primary distribution courses
(PDCs) are fulfilling their goal, which is to instruct students in
effective writing appropriate to the various disciplines, while covering topical material. The PDC program began in 1986, Holm said.
"Many people can't tell the difference between PDCs and nonPDCs," Holm said. For courses that are designed to teach writing,
this speaks to the ineffectiveness of the system in improving students' writing skills. Most PDCs make use of the Writing Associates program, in which trained sophomores, juniors and seniors
assist students in improving their writing.
Students do generally find the number of courses required of
them in each division acceptable.
Under the current system, each student must take three courses
from each of the three academic divisions: humanities, social sciences, and naturalsciences. Of the three courses in each division,
two must be PDCs from two different departments within the division. Some departments award credit for a certain score on Advanced Placement exams, counting them as the third course in the
three-course requirement.
It is a primary goal of many colleges and universities to teach
theirstudents to write well. Some, such as Amherst and the University of Pennsylvania, require freshmen to choose from a spectrum
of composition classes that focus on writing about specific topics or
for certain disciplines. Others, like Rice and some colleges within
Boston University, simply require entering students to take a composition exam; those who fail must take a writing course.
Although some students voiced a preference for no distribution
requirements at all, Holm said the general sentiment was aimed at
"strik[ing] a balancebetween schools like Brown and Amherst, which
have no distribution requirements, and schools like Columbia and
Chicago, which require an extensive core curriculum."
Many of the responses raised concerns about the PDC structure being "unduly restrictive," Holm said. Sometimes, students
wanted to take courses in a certain area within a division to fill a
requirement, but could not since there are no PDCs offered in that
area. Other students complained of being unable to fill PDC requirements even in their preferred divisions of study, sometimes
because of being overqualified for certain PDCs.
Although CEP has not made any decisions on definite or even
probable changes to the current distribution and PDC requirement
structure, several suggestions from the focus groups and written
responses are under consideration.
One modification in the area ofnatural sciences and engineering
may require the enrollmentofeach student in at least one lab science
course as a component of the three science courses already expected.
There is also the possibility of creating what Holm referred to
as "sophomore capstones," designed for students who must fill requirements in a division that they otherwise would not choose to
study in depth. Holm described a triplet of classes in which the
first two would fulfill the prerequisites for the last, which would
probably be an interdisciplinary science course of real interest to
the student. For example, a student might take Biology 1 as well as
Chemistry 10 and culminate in an interdisciplinary capstone on
AIDS, fulfilling the distribution requirement for the sciences.
Because the students who responded to Student Council's survey asserted that PDCs were not living up to their goal to improve
writing skills, there is the chance that the committee will propose
the elimination of PDCs or a modification of their objectives.
"There was a suggestion to have some sort of required course
just on writing," Holm said, "but there was strong student opposition to that, and I think it has been taken off the table."
CEP will likely make what Holm described as "some sort of nonbinding recommendation" to the faculty by the end of the year.

Giant ants were taped onto the sides of the "Abracadabra" sculpture outside Trotter as an April Fools' Day
prank. A "For Sale" sign was placed by the sculpture instructing interested buyers to contact the queen ant.

Other April Fools' Day pranks included a different bell order and a fake Public Safety notice
BY GERRIT HALL
Sunday, students showcased their ingenuity with
April Fools' day pranks, altering the bell tower chimes
and nesting giant ants on the Trotter sculpture.
Some of the pranks were the result of years of preparation. April Fools' Day stunts used to be bigger deal on
campus, said GabeRosenkoetter 'O2, one of the perpetrators of Sunday's mischief. Three years ago, his friends
had considered changing the tones of the bells, but opted
for other pranks instead. This year, he and a group of

friends decided to return to their old plan.
They found the location ofthe bell tower control room
and were able to break in by taking the hinges off the
door. They surveyed the room, and found a manual explaining the engineering behind the bell tower. They
studied the blueprints over the weekend, and figured
out what they could do to it.
"I wish that the bells could've been made to play
Jingle Bells, but it wasn'treally possible to do thatwithout breaking things," said Rosenkoetter. The group
changed the wiring positions, altering the bells' order.
The ants climbing the Trotter statues also took preparation. Nathaniel Fairfield 'Ol, who also put the plastic
wrap over the mailboxes and contributed to the bell
tower prank, helped create the ants. The ants' bodies
were made ofballoons.
After spending an evening blowing the balloons
up, Fairfield estimates that three-quarters of them

were popped trying to paint them, and even more
popped when placed on the statue.
One of the more popular pranks seemed to be an email that appeared to be from Associate Dean Tedd
Goundie. The e-mailreminded students of the daylight
savings time switch that day, but told students to set

their clocks back instead of forward. Goundie said he
received several polite responses from students.
"I thought it was an elegantly understated prank,"
said Goundie. "I still don't know what time it is."
Goundie said the identity of the pranksters is still
an enigma. Until Goundie knows whom to blame, he
has his own plan. "I figure I'll randomly pick on students until I hit the right one," he said.
The e-mail was not the only April Fools' Day prank
designed to confuse people with misinformation. Afake
public safety bulletin was also taped up to building
doors. Other pranks included a Wawa Yurt" designed
out of crates on Parrish beach, and an elaborate yarn
weave helixing the stairs in Parrish by SWIL members.
Public Safety officers were patrolling the campus
in the evening, but Rosenkoetter said they seemed
"appreciative and not too upset."
Many of the perpetrators hoped their efforts would
inspire a stronger tradition ofelaborateApril Fools' jokes.
"This year wasn't particularly fantastic," said
Fairfield. "We sort of wanted to bring back the idea of
April Fools' jokes, and make sure people realized we
were up to stuff."

College, Mind the
Light must meet for
civil dialogue
If your parents made it to Family Weekend, they
likely tasted a little slice of Swarthmore: Sharpies
food (although much improved), the campus in spring
and, yes, even the continuing athletic cuts controversy.
As reported in this week's news section, parent
and alumni members of Mind the Light, an independent organization dedicated to pressuring the college
to re-examine its decision to cut the athletics program, disruptively confronted President Al Bloom

and Provost Jennie Keith during a question-andanswer session held for parents.
For many, the emotional outbursts were a haunting specter of the ugly confrontation in the fieldhouse
immediately after the cuts were announced. For
some, the incident was another battle in a still raging
war. Regardless of perspective, the scene was a
painful reminder of the ugly scar on the college's
forehead, the progenitor of a burning, Harry Potteresque sensation.
The pain isn't going away anytime soon, but
neither Mind the Light nor the college administration
have been doing much to advance the healing process
about which both groups seem so concerned. The
Family Weekend incident was a perfect example of
how these two antagonistic groups both manage to
pour salt into everyone's wounds while simultaneously declaring themselves in the right.
On the administrative side of the incident, the
college needs to realize that it is dealing with a
special constituency, one that will not be satisfied by

fireside chats and simple explanatory letters. Time
and attentiveness may heal some wounds; others will
likely never feel affection for Swarthmore again. Yet
the attentiveness that only the administration can
provide has been, for the most part, absent. While a
few meetings have been held to address concerns, the
efforts to this point by no means constitute a forthcoming and wholehearted response.
Mind the Light has been no better. Despite
heartfelt prose on the Mind the Light Web site touting
Quaker unity and "a broad set of interests," the
behavior of many members of the group has been
frighteningly divisive. By forcefully commandeering
what was at one point a quite civil meeting between
parents and administrators, members of Mind the
Light did nothing but hurt the group's image in the
eyes of those present and those who have since heard
about the incident.
Furthermore, many members of the group have
taken to flinging wild, paranoid accusations at those
even remotely connected to the administration. At
the meeting, a Mind the Light member claimed that
Bloom had brought cops to the meeting; in fact, the
two public safety officers present had been asked by
the Alumni Office to attend the meeting to address
parents' concerns about the recent wave of campus
crime. A Phoenix reporter's questions about the
group were answered, but only with a demeaning

insult.
We understand and even, in a way, applaud
the concerns of Mind the Light and its members. But
their tactics and carriage have damaged themselves
and their cause rather than advocated it.
If the college and Mind the Light genuinely hope to
make any significant progress in the healing process,
administrators must set aside more time to respond
to questions about the cuts, and Mind the Light must
abandon its confrontational tactics and sniping abuse
in favor of civil dialogue. Otherwise, the college may
remain at this impasse for far too long.

Column enlightening
Dear Editor:
Elizabeth Goldsmith's column "An Unruly Member" (March
29) was right on target, and very important. I havefelt the way
she described, feeling that "picking up the phone or mailing a
letter are too much to ask of yourself." Although I knew that I
suffer from depression, I always assumed that these moments
were due to the Swat workload and the fact thatI'm usually too
tired to move anyway. Those types of symptoms are not often
discussed by doctors never in the nine years since I've been
diagnosed had anyone mentioned them to me in this context—but they are the most common forms my depression takes.

CORRECTIONS
In last week's issue, it was reported in "Human rights
workers call for end to Plan Columbia" that several
priests were assassinated by guerilla forces. They were
in fact asassinated by right-wing paramilitary forces.
In the March 22 article "Expanding the team: SMART to
increase student membership," the quote "[the survivor
support group has been] very active until the last two
years" should have been attributed to Karen Henry.

Athletics facilities
improvements begin
Dear Editor:
Last week's editorial about athletics at Swarthmore suggested that "the administration" had not done much of anything to improve the athletic experience of students here, focusing at least in part on the lack of attention to facilities
issues. I do want to point out just a few things that have happened in the past few years on the facilities front, things accomplished by "the administration," many at the direct request of students: a new women's softball field, a new wood
floor in Tarble Pavilion, the Mullan Tennis Center, the resurfacing ofall our outdoor tennis courts, the renovation oflocker
rooms including those in Ware Pool, the complete renovation
of the mechanical systems in Ware, the maintenance of what
are probably the best outdoor fields in the conference or the
replacing of the outdoor track this coming summer.
Many, many millions of dollars have been spent just in
the last few years and countless hours of attention and work.
Is there more to do? Absolutely, and future plans are being

developed with coaches and student-athletes to address outstanding issues.

Family Weekend shouldn't be about deception
BY MORGHAN HOLT
Whether your parents joined the hoards that came to visit
their blossoming young Swatties or not, if you were on campus this weekend, you were witness to a pretty remarkable
phenomenon. That is, you probably noticed the alterations,
from uncharacteristic sobriety to improved dining hall cuisine, that were made over the course of the three days to
accommodate parents, their expectations and their tastes.
I understand the cause of these changes, of course. We
want to make good impressions on the people who are footing the (not-so-small) bill for our Swarthmore educations;
we want them to enjoy their time spent in our domain. Likewise, Swarthmore wants to impress the people who are putting up our tuitions, if only to ensure that the checks keep
coming in. So, naturally, we put our best foot forward, forgoing our usual weekend sleaziness, we act like the perfect
angels our parents want us to be; Sharpies radically improves
the grub that parents have spent the last four months listening to their children bitch about. This wouldn't bother me,
really, if it didn't seem so phony and counterproductive.
We want our parents to appreciate our blooming independence, yet as soon as they enter our space and have a
chance to understand and appreciate our academic experience, we go out of our way to gloss over our Swarthmore
existences. We greet people we ordinarily ignore, we feign
interest in the adult conversation at the dinner table and
refrain from catapulting spoonfuls of peas across the big
room at our friends and roommates, and we nod in ceaseless enthusiastic agreement with whatever our parents say.
We smile a lot more frequently and we generally act like
we're not miserable and stressed out the way we are when
they're not around. The only thing we don't have to pretend
is that we like the food. The Sharpies staff, recognizing our
plight, made that one easy for us.
The thing that killed me about watching Swatties interact
with and metamorphose for their parents duringFamily Weekend is that we, as a whole, spend so much time demanding

that we be respected for who we are. We develop unique personalities and representations ofourselves and the campus
grows accustomed to us in our raw, real form. Until, that is,
our parents show up. Suddenly, we ironand tuck in our shirts
and hide our supposed "true" selves, afraid of our parents'
reactions to our usual scrubbiness. Swat affords us liberties
that we weren't allowed at home. Therefore, when the worlds
collide, we're left in limbo, trying to decidebetween the "self'
our parents know, love and pay to educate and the we've
developed for our time at Swarthmore.

I anticipated tension between parents and their children
during the weekend visits, but the struggle I envisioned was
more along the lines of the parents coming to terms with
and accepting the personal growth that has transformed us
into the unique and colorfully creative people Swarthmore
has helped us become. I certainly

Watching my fellow students interact withtheir folks,
I was depressed by the way they changed their personalities; regardless of intent, they were selling themselves
and theirparents short. We owe it to ourselves to be true
to ourselves and embrace the personal developments that
have come of our time at Swat, but we owe it to our parents to provide themwith accurate representations of our
college lives, our "selves." Admittedly, we don't want to
let them down, but is it really worth it to feign eager excitement about all things Swarthmorefor an entire weekend only to have our parents leave with fragmented,
sugar-coated perceptions and no greater appreciation or
understanding of our college experiences while we slink
back into the basement of McCabe, confronted by the misery of our overwhelming workloads and drained by the
effort of maintaining our cheerful balancing acts?

didn't expect the former "selves,"
err... the phony, forced "selves" to
win out. But, sadly, they did. My
parents didn't come to Family
Weekend, but I found myself wishing at one point that they had, if
only because I wanted to prove to
myself that I would not change my
personality or habits to accommodate my parents, even in the name
of hospitality. When I talk to my
parents about Swat and my experience here, I want them to understand what things are like for me.
I want them to recognize my
struggles and stress as well as the
enjoyable moments I recount. I
don't want them to interpret
Swarthmore one-dimensionally,
and I'm afraid that that's exactly

what a lot ofSwat parents wound
updoing.

Some tips on how to avoid being shafted in the housing lottery
BY TED CHAN
Myrt, I'm a nice guy. I really am.
Poor Dean Westphal has borne the brunt of my housing
frustrations, getting sour e-mails and scathing editorials after I take the proverbial annual housing lotto shaft. But in
the wisdom of my latter years here at Swat, I've come to see
that it's not her fault or anyone else's, except maybe mine.
No, I haven't had the greatest success in my housing days,
but as a grizzled veteran, I'm happy to pass on some tips so
that you can avoid making the same mistakes I made.

1 Block
Blocking is the best way to get this all done with and be
sure that you'll be living in a place you like with some people
you can stand. Remember: blocking as a rising sophomore
uses up your top cohort. But maybe that's the time when
you most want to use up that high number.

2. Read the packet carefully
Okay, if you're blocking, make sure you know the rules. I'd

live with a bunch of people for sophomore year, but
hadn't read the rules at all. So we ended up putting down a
quad in Mertz as our first choice, and ugh, a block in Willets as
our third or fourth, thinking it was better than going into the
lotto and getting ML. So we used our top cohort pick to live on
Willets first south for a second straight year. And then I drew
799 out of 800 in my class for this year. It wouldn't have been so
bad if we'd had a nice double somewhere sophomore year, but
living in Willets for two years has made me a sour, sour man.

3. If you've got a problem, speak up
If you have a medicalproblem, get a doctor's note and tell
Myrt. You're not imposing on anyone. They try hard to make
your life easier, but they can't do it unless they know about it.

One room might look tiny on the floor plan, but it could
have high ceilings, a big window and a nice closet, while a
bigger-looking one might be cut off. This is especially true

ones on campus). Seek him or her out if you're a rising
sophomore and both you and your roommate draw really
bad numbers. A rising junior or senior cannot pick below
the first person picking in the class under them.

5. Scout
Don't just look at the little dorm plans. If you're blocking, get your group together and look at the rooms. If you're
in the lottery, ask some upperclassmen what your number
might buy you, and check out some of those rooms. One of
the things I really like about Swarthmore is that in a lot of

in Parrish.
Really, stairs aren't so bad. They're good for you and
you'll get used to them.Don't just cross a nice room off your
list because it's on the third or fourth floor of something.

The view is much better from the top floors, and the higher
up the room is, the quieter it tends to be.
7. Think not what a room can do for you, but what you can

do for a room

Ultimately, there are very few perfect rooms on this campus. Decide what your priorities are, base your choice on

those, and then work to remedy the room's other features.
For instance, location was the most important thing for me
last year. I ended up with a relatively smallroom floor spacewise, but a futon sofa and shelves have allowed me to make
the most of it. Think what a loft might do for a room with
little floor space but high ceilings, or a sarong for those terrible Mertz walls.

8. Live off campus
If you don'tmind walking, it's a good option. It can be slightly
cheaper, there are a variety of options, and you don't have to
be on the meal plan, which means you can cook for yourself or
eat at Cheng Hing. I would've done it, but I'm just too lazy.
9. Be prepared and flexible

WHAT KEEPS ONE UP AT NIGHT

First off, know what you want and go for it, but if you
don't get it, RAs will tell you about other appealing options
at the lottery. The more flexible you are, the better your
chances of finding something are. Some will be triples or

quads or quints. If you've talked about it with other pairs or
triplets of roommates, you'll be more ready to pounce on a
phat quad if your plans for that double in Mertz go awry.

10. Talk to your elders
We've weathered the storm and enduredall the hardships
of Swarthmore housing. Most of us are glad to pass on our
wisdom. Upperclassmen can tell you where the hidden gem

OUTSIDE
THE BOX
Athletics are not 'diversity'
Diversity week was a waste of paper. (An unnecessarily
provocative lead-in, but Lane has inspired me). This was cerI'm sure everyone dutifully
tainly true in a literal sense
used all five blank pages allotted to notes in the unsolicited
diversity packets. And while the wondrous breadth of our
student population is magnificent to behold, Outside the Box
believes that the language of diversity has been taken too far.
What has led this columnist to such an outrageous assertion? When BOM, Inc. decided to suddenly eliminate the
football team, dissidents of the decision made a number of
good arguments for why the team should not have been cut.
These included thelack of a Quaker consensus, the betrayal
of the promises made to football players and the fact that we
actually had a decent team. I burst out laughing, though,
when I saw an argument claiming that the team added diversity to the school, and presumably that the team and its
members should therefore be kept around because they will
continue to offer us diversity in the future. Thanks for the
diversity, guys, we appreciate it greatly.
The bizarre use of the word "diversity" in this context was
continued during Diversity Week. Last week, the deans held
a fireside chat to discuss "athletes as diversity." Evidently we
didn't admit Joe Lacrosse because he has stick skills
in
fact, those same skills somehow create a more diverse environment for all of us. As we've all been told over and over,
diversity is good, right? After all, don't we learn from interacting with those who have had different life experiences?
The first invalid assumption underlying this line ofthinking is that the more diversity we have, the better. On a personal level, I get absolutely no diversity-value-added out of
having Joe Lacrosse in my classes. Sure, I like thekids on the
lacrosse teams, but not because they play lacrosse. In fact,
they are the exact same people as you and me, only they run
around a field beating each other up every day. Can the rest
of us really learn different life experiences and cultural contexts from the lacrosse team, solely based on their identity as
lacrosse players? By the logic of"the more diversity the better," we should be admitting circus clowns over lacrosse players, because I'm damned well sure that any kid our age who'd
choose to be a clown would have a much more profound and
bizarre life story than one who became a lacrosse player.
Clearly if we accept surface diversity as a virtue, then we
must judge what diversity is beneficial and what isn't.
Certainly lacrosse players can add a diverse aspect to
campus, but this is determined on an individual level, and

by matters unrelated to their identity as lacrosse players.
Originally, affirmative action began as a program to rectify
America's horrendous crimes against blacks, and over time
it has been extended to other minority groups who were discriminated against in the past. As the March 23 issue of the
Economist argues, this reasoning then became a bit dicey
for a numberof reasons. What about a recent African immigrant whose ancestors never suffered slavery, or a poor
Appalachian white or Latina child who must compete with
the children of a black doctor? Because of these problems
and others, it seems that today the primary justificationfor
affirmative action on the campus level has morphed into
the desire to provide more diversity. In effect, the football
team took this rampaging ball and ran with it.
This brings me to the second invalid assumption underlying the diversity paradigm: that diversity can be measured
by group categorization. Certainly we should admit kids of
achievement coming out of disadvantaged neighborhoods,
because from a contextual standpoint their accomplishment
was far more impressive than whatever the class nerdfrom
Scarsdale, N.Y. did. But the way to go about admitting them
should be to look at eachindividual's character and life story,
as opposed to his or her color, creed or activities. If the admissions department does its job right and looks into achievers from all walks of life, Swarthmore will continue to move
away from our shamefully homogenous past. The justification for affirmative action should be contextual achievement,
and we should stop pretending that we can measure diversity through largely superficial characteristics.
The football team has effectively informed us that the
diversity regime has reached its absurd crescendo. The time
has come to shed this bizarre bout of curious diversity lin-

guistics and recognize that diversity should not be measured
by the color of our skin or the nature of our sport, but by the
content of our character. Or better yet, Outside the Box would
prefer we not try to measure this ridiculous concept at all.

McCain-Feingold bill not necessary
BY DAVID HAENDLER

According to reformers like John McCain, the way we
fund elections in the United States is in need of drastic
restructuring. They claim that interest groups routinely
buy offnational leaders with big cash donations, and that
the moneychangers must be driven from the Capitol steps
if our democracy is to endure. However, a cynical man
might wonder why, if campaign finance reform is such a
challenge to the powers that be, the government seems so
willing to pass it into law.
The McCain-Feingoldbill, which would drastically restructure the way elections are financed, was just passed in the
Senate by a comfortable 59-41 margin. If it gets through the
House, President George W. Bush, a man who cherishes corporate donations like a mother cherishes her children, is
widely expected to sign it. Either a sudden fit of goodwill and
civic-mindedness has overtaken Capitol Hill, or campaign finance reform isn't the panacea to corruption that it's touted
as. I tend to suspect the latter. I don't mean to imply that
John McCain and Russ Feingold are bad men. They're not.
As far as I can tell, both of them are decent, hard-working
legislators who genuinely want to improve the way that Washington works. But their crusade takes a nonexistent problem, magnifies it to unrealistic proportions and then remedies it in a way which only makes things worse.
Big money's influence on the political process is smaller
and less sinister than the hype might lead one to believe.
Studies have shown that on average, politicians maintain
pretty consistent ideological records throughout the years
regardless of the state of their finances. And retiring legislators, who don't need to worry about the next campaign
and are thus freed from the influence of fund-raising, vote
exactly the same way they have for the rest of their careers.
In general, campaign contributions aren't given out as quid
pro quo. They're given out to politicians who already support the causes being advocated. The NRA doesn'thand Jesse
Helms thousands of dollars because without that precious
bribe money he'd turn around and confiscate every gun in
the nation. They give him money because he believes the
same things they do and they want to keep him in office as
long as they can. This is not to say that donations have no
effect on the system. Politicians who are heavily bankrolled
by certain groups do tend to work harder in matters where
those groups are concerned. But people run for office because they have ideas and interests of their own, not be-

cause they want to spend the rest of their lives singlemindedly grubbing for donations and obeying CEOs.
And even if moneyed interests are capable of steering
the concerns of policymakers, who cares? What's so strange
and unwelcome about citizens of a democracy trying to influence theirpolitical leaders? In principle, donating money
to a politician's war chest is no different than running getout-the-vote drives or printing an editorial in favor of a particular candidate. In each case, an organization is spending
resources (be it cold hard cash, the time and energy of its
members, or column space) in an attempt to influence the
outcome of an election. Also in each case, you can put a
monetary value on the resources being utilized. Every glowing op-ed piece about a candidate that appears in The New
York Times represents advertising space which his campaign didn't have to shell out funds for. Every NAACP volunteer who goes out canvassing represents one more worker
who didn't need to be paid. In order to effectively combat
groups which seek to manipulate the electoral process, the
government would have to impose tight regulations on all
political speech and action, a goal which directly defies both
the letter and spirit of the First Amendment.
Finally, giving Congress power over campaign funding is
like putting high school seniors in charge of college admissions offices. In United States elections, incumbents already
start out with massive advantages over challengers. Incumbent politicians get free media exposure, name recognition
and the ability to bribe the electorate with pork-barrel projects.
They also tend to have more connections with lobbyists than
challengers, making it easier for sitting politicians to raise
direct campaign contributions. There are two ways for an
upstart candidate to overcome these fundraising hurdles. You
can either be independently wealthy and fund the campaign
out of your own pocket, or you can get help from your political party. McCain-Feingold would effectively shut down that
second avenue to electoral viability. Any Congressman with
a modicum of self-interest would be an idiot not to vote for
this! Not only do they look like good guys on the side of "reform," but they also get to insulate themselves from competition. There are loopholes that a skillful challenger could exploit (for instance, the bill's restrictions on issue advocacy
ads are unlikely to pass judicial review), but forcing them to
pore over law books when they could be out on the campaign
trail making theirideas heard is a disservice to democracy. It
may sound crass, but the free flow of money and the free flow
of ideas go hand in hand.

Free exchange of ideas necessary to liberal arts
BY SARAH CLARK
I come from another small liberal
arts college. Before experiencing how
amazing Swarthmore is, I knew it was
unique. I looked at statistics about
Swarthmore students. I talked to Swarthmore professors, looked at their syllabi and examined their texts. I felt like
I had a pretty good idea of what I could
expect, and I was right. Students were
as bright, intelligent and well-spoken
as I had imagined. The professors were
more demanding and stimulating than
I expected. There was only one thing
I didn't expect.
On "veg night" at Sharpies last
week, I saw a Swattie tear down a sign
put up by a member of the Animal
Rights Coalition. There are two things
that I find ironic about this. First, this
was during Diversity Week. Second, it
was a Swattie.
I thought Diversity Week was about
teaching all of us to respect and gain
understanding for other people's cultures and beliefs. Someone argued with
me, saying that the signs were a pro-

test against meat-eaters. Indeed they
were. However, the action can only be
categorized as a passive protest. There
was no violence in the signs posted in
Sharpies that night. They were an expression ofsomeone's beliefs. The violence was in people tearing down the
signs.

A person's beliefs should be respected
just as we respect their faith or culture.
There is no respect in tearing down a sign

because you don't agree with its message.
Being here is about questioning our beliefs, challenging each other and thinking,

not for being reactionary. I would expect
to find tolerance for these things in a community of Swarthmore students, espe-

cially during a timereserved to celebrate

and respect diversity.
How many of us chose this kind of
school over an Ivy League school? We
chose liberal arts because it offered something the other institutions lacked. We
wanted more than a textbook education,
right? So why dismiss each others' ideas?
We should be able to take advantage of the

different beliefs and cultures of our class-

mates in order to enrich our understanding of each other.
The other day a professor said that de-

bate is what a liberal arts education is
about. Rather than thoughtful debate,
I see students who either think so
highly of their own beliefs that they
choose not to tolerate any other beliefs
or are just too lazy to listen. My frustration comes from knowing how intelligent people are. They just choose
not to exploit the intelligence and ideas
of their peers. Read an article in the
Phoenix, read a student's paper or just
sit in on a class, and you can't argue
with the fact that you are surrounded
by extremely bright people. Why we are
so quick to place each other in boxes?
The guide to student life states that
Swat "is committed to maintaining itself as a place where students and student groups are exposed to and learn
from their contact with a wide diversity of ideas." We can't learn if we don't
listen to these ideas! Arguing your beliefs to someone is a challenge. There
is an even more amazing challenge in
listening to someone else's ideas and,
as a consequence, questioning your
own. There are many students who understand and take advantage ofthis unlimited resource they will have experienced a real liberal arts education.
As liberal arts students, this is what
we should strivefor. If you can't learn
from your peers, if you can't tolerate
ideas otherthan your own, ifyou would
rather not challenge yourself, maybe a
liberal arts education isn't for you.

OPINIONS
GABROIE;

The winter and the spring:
Gabriel offers reflections

FRESH OFF
THE BOAT
I could talk about the winter. Sure, it's pretty much over,
but it has left its scars. During the darkness of the winter I
saw how many of us have not even started to get over our
high-school models of living, complete with traumas and
insecurities. I saw how so many of us live a paranoid existence, completely over-indulged in worrying and feeling
anxious about that which is beyond our control. I felt the
weight of the two sand trucks I often haul with ropes tied
to my back when I have to turn things in or face growing
social and academic obligations.
During the cold, frigid months, I noticed how this campus is completely fragmented and essentially divided. There
are those that take interest in the instrumentality of education; others see education as an end in itself. It was too
bad that during those months I saw fewer and fewer people
who fall in the second category. The pamphlets claiming
that our students do things out of real passion and seek
out the truth in themselves are to a large extent a hoax.
February and March showed me how excessively it
rains here and how the weather is frequently bad both figuratively and literally. It conveyed a sad message, telling
me that we are a bunch of crazy fools taking our medications when and how we are told without questioning the
establishment or ourselves. We were, for the most part,
spoiled kids during these months, shelteredfrom the world
as we agonized about "work."
The winter months, though tough to handle, suggested
some ways to deal with the darkness and anxiety that are
often pervasive here. They showed me that my world can
have altogether different forms, hues, colors and intensities that represent the same things at different points in
time. The sun is on its way and it brings a new brush, pal-

ette and canvas.
The warm light shows how most of us are committed to a
high standard of moral conduct. It shows me how our lack of
sociability is often due to shyness. It shows me how our reclusive tendencies can be attributed to introspection.
The sun's rays may grab you; they may force you to take a
deep breathand reconsider your priorities. You may find that
what you have been committed to is not as real as it seemed to

THE EVER-COMPLICATED TERMS

EXPLANATIONS MAY NOT BE AS

be. You may see that it is ultimately not that important if you
stay in college or leave, if you write your paper or you don't.
You may find that what you thought made you so happy actually brought you down, that what you revered was punishing
you.
You may find yourself in the office of a professor you admire and have a conversation with him that goes a little beyond questions that relate purely to the text. You may realize
that beyond a student and a teacher both of you are people
who share a common space. You may find yourself being a
little bit more open, more willing to depart from previous pre-

cepts as you allow change to do its thing.
You may find yourself recognizing the ridiculous aspect
of extreme intellectualism. The ever-complicated terms
acting as systems of explanations may not be as helpful as
they seem when dealing with reality. In fact, they might
just be unnecessary, as they do not render a more accurate
or true version of existence. Just another paradigm, not
any truer than the way a Native American shaman may
see his world.
As we shake off the winter and embrace the spring, I
am reminded of a little analogy that may be good to keep
in mind. The best referees are not those who look exclusively or excessively for violations of the rules, but those
who ensure that the game is being played at its best. As a
critical person, do you find yourself blowing the whistle
excessively? Do you think about the nature of that which
you are supervening before you make your next call?
Think about how many of your calls you make out of
simple fear of failure or fear of not corresponding to expectations. Then think about the calls you would really
like to be making, if there are any.

He explains that the long-standing problem with the Clothier bell
tower has not been suicide attempts,
but rather the tons ofbird droppings
that tended to accumulate in the
tower. "The pigeons were bad, but then the starlings
came," he says. Feces used to lie four inches deep on the
staircase. To combat the problem, netting was recently

installed to keep out birds.
Inside the bell tower, all that can be seen by looking
up is stairs and more stairs. The first flight winds tightly
up a stone-walled shaft. The second flight is even narrower and provides an open view to the ground, though
a railing provides some reassurance. The climb seems
long, but the view, impressive even from the first land-

ing, is spectacular from the top.
Stu Hain, Director ofFacilities Management, says that
the tower is one ofhis favorite spots on campus. "If it's a
clear day, you can really see Philly," he says. Even on
this dark, overcast day, the Philadelphia skyline stands
out clearly to the east. Much of New Jersey is visible

Maintenance workers hate the occasional times they
have to climb the tower to repairs the bells, Tom says,
because they have to bring up everything they need for

the job at once or else make multiple trips .
Others have had more fun with the bell tower in the
past. Stu says that Larry Schall, vice president for facilities and development, rappelled off the top of the
tower with the climbing club about four years ago.
The belt tower will be opened to students on Friday, April
20. Groups of no more than 20 students will be taken up from
1 p.m. and 3 p.m\ Stu seems eager to let students climb up

burning the latter because of favorable prices.
"On a cold day, we could go through a tractor

A smaller room houses the electrical supply

padlocked door, and we climb 37 more
stairs that are covered with crumbling

call Parrish Fifth
a story above the
WSRN studio
and are greeted with
an open, spacious room whose floorhas
been mostly covered with the same
plaster. Glass lies scattered around the
center of the room from broken skylights under the widow's walk. Although commonly referred to as the

ballroom, this space was once home to
the former mathematics library.
"This place is a mess because over
the years, students have broken in
here," Stu says.
The old banister is broken and old
furniture arranged in such a way that
intruders could climb the stairs and
enter the room without being detected by the motion detector in the
corner. The motion detector is still
functioning and blinks its lights at us
as we move around the room. Stu tells
us that the detector is linked to the

Public Safety office in Ben West.
"We constantly have people try to do
all kinds of stuff," Stu says. "It's gotten
to the point of risking life and limb," he
adds, indicating the reason for the padlocked door and motion sensors.
Graffiticovers the walls of the room, and
several broken chairs sit in a corner. A
clothesline supports severalpairs ofunderwear. The "underwear line," Tom says,
"once went from here to Clothier tower."
The renovation of the room has been
discussed many times, Stu says, but concerns about fire safety always override
potential plans. In the three years following the completion of the new science
center in 2004, Parrish willbe renovated.
"Sadly," Stu says, "this will likely
become a machine room." The renovation will include about five elevators
whose shafts will terminate at thislevel.

Despite the slight give in the
wire, the grid is constructed
out of aircraft cable. The
cables, in fact, are more durable than the support
beams upon which they rest, and Stu wonders how
long it will be before they have to replace thebeams.
Jon Elmer 'O4, a technician for last weekend's
"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern" performance,
is setting up. Asked what he thinks of the grid,
he replies, "It's a whole lot easier than ladders."
Stu's original position at the college was
project manager for the construction ofLPAC in
1991, so he is particularly fond of the building.
"It's quite a piece of engineering," he says. After
the building was completed, Stu decided to remain at the college as the facilities manager, and
he's been here ever since.
At the rear of the theater is the wall that separates it from the cinema. The 300,000-lb. wall is
supported by two 250-lb. screws sitting on the
building's foundation. "It's the only wall like that
in the country," Stu says proudly.
When raised, the wall is designed to stop automatically six inches from the ceiling, Stu says, in
case someone "falls asleep on top ofthewall." Once,
a stack offour chairs was accidentally left sitting
on top of the wall whenit was raised. The wall did
indeed stop six inches from the ceiling, Stu says,
and thefour chairs were squeezed into that space.

as such until it was severely damaged in a fire on Sept. 16,1983.
The fire was likely caused by arson, by someone pouring flam

says. He debates with Stu over whether rumor held the perpetrato
to be a student or not. In any case, the state police never had enoug

chines were beyond a fire break, he says, firefighters who becam

Tim Buckley: An enchanting career, a brilliant anthology
lar in death than in life, Jeffreleased more posthumously

BY MATT RUBIN
My father introduced me to Tim Buckley. Many nights,
as I lay in bed falling asleep at night or waking up in the
morning, he would play Buckley's lovely lullaby "Sing A
Song For You" on a twelve-string dreadnought guitar, the
same instrument Buckley used to record the song originally.
My father, a bit shy, never thought I was actually awake and
listening, but I was, and my fascination with Tim Buckley's
gorgeous music had begun.
On March 20, Elektra released "Morning Glory: The Tim
Buckley Anthology," a beautifully packaged two-disc collection of Buckley's best work. The two CDs are a perfect
introduction for anyone who, like me, owns few or none of
Buckley's 10-disc catalogue. The set also includes 30 great
pages of liner notes, including accounts from top music ex-

ecutives, fellow musicians and
friends.
"Morning Glory" presents a
musician molding a beautiful,
impressively creative body of
work from an extremely varied
set of influences. Though
Buckley was a clear descendent
of mid-1960s experimental folk
artists like Fred Neil and Tom
Rush, he pushed the limits of
their style to an extent they had
never attempted. Though ostensibly a folk artist, Buckley's music borders on brooding, dark
rock, accentuated by his range-defying, angelic voice.

than during his lifetime.
"Morning Glory" was released in the wake of Jeff s ris

ing popularity. After Jeffs mother released his demos,
live album, and a video, virtually all Jeff Buckley mate
rial in the world had been exhausted. Ironically, only then
at a crest of Jeff Buckley popularity that could not possi
bly be sustained, was this much-needed Tim Buckley ret
rospective released.
Tim Buckley, despite the fact that his life was thre
years shorter, was clearly the more accomplished and pro
lific member of the family, and "Morning Glory" does
splendid job of picking the best and most appropriate ma
terial from his productive yet incredibly varied career
Buckley began his career as a more traditional, poppy folk
artist, releasing an eponymous debut LP to this effect in
1966. Its highlights include
"Wings" and "She Is," two beauti

BUCKLEY'S MUSIC IS BOTH
HAUNTED AND HAUNTING,
THE WORK OF A

PSYCHOLOGICALLY
TROUBLED AND MUSICALLY
GIFTED ARTIST.

Buckley's music is both haunted and haunting, the work
of a psychologically troubled and musically gifted artist
swept up by the wave of the sixties only to land in the violently confused decade to follow.Like fellow troubadour Phil
Ochs, Buckley saw his popularity dwindle at approximately
the same rate as 1960s idealism, and so one night, in what
was most likely suicide, he snorted a line of heroin and ended
his life at the age of 28.
It was Tim Buckley's death that helped deify his son, the
young Jeff Buckley, who also died at an early age and under
odd circumstances. Jeff, in the process of recording a follow-up to his critically acclaimed 1994 album "Grace," disappeared one night while swimming in the Mississippi River
with a friend. He was 30.
After his death, Jeffs fans, many of whom he inherited
from his father, formed a sort of cult around the young rock
star. Led by Jeffs mother (Tim's widow) fans held listening
parties

and

vigils for

the recently departed Jeff. More popu-

remarkable voice.
As the decade progressed
Buckley meshedthis style with hi
quickly developing emotiona
state, and to great effect. It wa
also during this time that Buckle

began to incorporate vibes int
virtually all of his songs. In 196
he released "Goodbye and Hello'
"Morning Glory" chooses th
darkest tunes from that album. Specifically, "Pleasan
Street" and "Hallucinations" are two moving ballads tha
showcase a rapidly evolving songwriter. Both songs mak
use of new techniques of production, and would most likely
still be hailed as impressively innovative if released to
day.
Seemingly charted for both popular and artistic sue
cess, Buckley released "Goodbye and Hello" in 1968 to criti
cal acclaim. It was Buckley's most popular effort, peakin
at No. 81 on the Billboard charts. The album, as well a
"Morning Glory," featured folksier songs, like "Once
Was," as well as more ambitious efforts, such as "Sing
Song for You." It was during this time that Buckley als
began to tentatively espouse a sort of revisionist rebe
liousness, gently mocking Vietnam War protestors wit
such songs as "No Man Can Find the War," in which hj

asks the protestors, "Is the war inside your mind?"
"Morning Glory" also contains some live material from
this time period, which was arguably the musical peak o
Buckley's short career. At the close of the first disc ar
three songs taken from "Dream Letter," a previously re
leased live album of Buckley's first onstage concert in
London, which took place at the end of 1968. "Phantasma
goria in Two," released on an earlier album, is found her
with a more brooding and complex arrangement. Mean
while, on "Troubadour" and "I've Been Out Walking,
Buckley explores both the high and low limits of his gen
der-defiant voice, engaging in his first example of ex
tended, and incredible, vocal improvisation.
Perhaps the greatest achievement of "Morning Glory,
however, is its ability to create a pleasant second disc tha
chronicles the later, more eclectic portion of Buckley's ca
reer while still maintaining a sense of continuity. Afte
"Goodbye and Hello," Buckley turned to a an even darker
more experimental stage ofhis career. On "Blue Afternoon
(Jan. 1970), "Lorca" (June 1970) and "Starsailor" (Nov. 1970)
Buckley stripped down his arrangements, decreasing production and often dropping fuller orchestrations and vibe
in favor of more natural percussion and a more dominan
acoustic bass. "Chasing the Blues Away," with its shaky ye
tranquil melodies hanging precariously over a dissonan
acoustic bass, both highlights and exemplifies this period.
Disappointed with the lack of success of his more pro
lific and ambitious efforts, Buckley entered the final stag
of his career. In it, he strove unsuccessfully for popula
success, turning to sexier R&B/rock. Buckley focused on
this stage of his career from 1972 until his death, all th
while becoming more dissatisfied with the music indus
try whose spoils eluded him. "Morning Glory," however
deals tactfully with this disappointing era, mainly by in
eluding only five songs total from Buckley's final thre
albums. Of these, the highlight is "Song to The Siren,

which actually makes good use of Buckley's newfound electric tendencies. Indeed, "Song to the Siren" started a mild
Tim Buckley rediscovery in the early 1980s when it was covered by the art-rock band This Mortal Coil, leading to a new
pressing of Buckley's CD catalogue.
"Morning Glory" is a nearly perfect compilation. The editorial decisions made in regard to song choice were stellar
and judicious. In particular, the decision to include live
material was particularly instructive to those who, like
myself, are looking for the musical peaks of Tim Buckley's
sadly shortened career. "Morning Glory," with its 23 songs
and over 150 minutes of music, should be the first stop in
any prospective Tim Buckley fan's journey.
Buckley's legacy is sweeping. In addition to This Mortal
Coil, Buckley has influenced a generation of emotional
singer-songwriters, the most visible being his son Jeff. Jeff,
like his father, pushed the limits of the vocal instrument.
Indeed, "Morning Glory" is essential for anyone trying to
understandthe younger Buckley's music. And Jeffisn't alone
in rehashing his old man's songs: contemporary bands have
also covered Buckley's music. Among these bands is
Radiohead, a band that I, in a role reversal, introduced to
my father. The song they chose: "Sing a Song for You."

Soyinka's 'Jero Plays' add
drama to African Week

ARTS

McCabe ready to bust
BY KATEY O'DONNELL

BY DANIEL MARRIN

"Since I came to Swarthmore, I have not seen one African play. There
is not nearly enough African theatre at Swarthmore," said Tsiri
Agbenyega 'O3, director of this Saturday's performance ofWole Soyinka's

"The Jero Plays."
Agbenyega, a Ghanaian student, mentioned this sentiment to African
groups and acquaintances on campus to no avail, so he took it upon himself to direct a play for Africa Week. Agbenyega is co-directing with Emily
Tancredi-Brice 'O4, who helped him collect a mixed crew and cast ofboth
native Africans and African-Americans.
Wole Soyinka is a Nigerian satirist and the only African writer to ever
win the Nobel Prize for Literature. Many African writers have refused to
write in English, which is considered the tongue of the colonizer, but
Soyinka saw it as a means to touch an international audience with his
work. I remember seeing Soyinka on "Nightline" as an often-featured
speaker on African issues. I knew that Soyinka was a writer in exile. Still,
I never understood how his writing created such hostility in his country.
The reason is prominent and clear-cut in Agbenyega and TancrediBrice's production. "The Jero Plays" are probably one of Soyinka's tamer
pieces, yet their implications are no less poignant. At the root ofit all is
a false African prophet, a con man named Jeroboam (Jumatatu Poe 'O3)
who slowly builds a base of power in a beachside community, where the

local Africans are seen as riffraff and the white Salvation Army as their
designated reformers, led by Major Silva (Gerrit Hall 'O4). Jero steps in to

So I walked into Mc Cabe this morning at the ungodly
hour of 8:30 and there was the face ofliana Luft 'O3 staring right at me.
Except thatit wasn't actually herface. It was her bust.
Not that kind of bust, perv. It was a clay portrait bust. I
gotta say, that early in the morning, I was a little weirded
out. But that's more a reflection of mypre-noon non-functionalism than it is of the work itself. In fact, the sculpture, like the other anatomical representations that were
clustered in the lobby, was remarkably naturalistic. I am
always amazed by the talent of my fellow students. It totally awes me that I am part of such a talented community and that all these people are only about 20.
Which is why I am also looking forward to the rest of
theList Gallery shows this semester. With only six weeks
left (shock horror... panic!) the display will be changing every week or so. From April 13 through June 1, the
List Gallery will present a series of exhibitions by
Swarthmore College senior art majors. The featured
artists start off with Ryan Neiheiser's mixed media
works and continue with Tracy Powell, Eben Myers,
Molly Kalkstein, Eric Leive, Lynne DeSilva-Johnson,
Jane Ng, and Rose Fox.
Stay tuned for reviews of the senior shows. In the
meantime, you have to be exceptionally self-absorbed
or one of those Cornell types to miss the masterful
McCabe display. So check it out. And don't just pass
through and take it all for granted— ZooA; at the stuff.

lead a local congregation, create a confederation of church groups from
around the area and then become the leader of them all. We never really
get an idea of what Jero is after, aside from power over as many believers
as possible. While clearly leading his faithful down the wrong path, Jero
is suave, understanding and very persuasive.
The first one-act play, "The Trials of Brother Jero," deals with Jero's
rise to the leadership of a local congregation, specifically by eliminating
the one threat to his good name, a local woman named Amope (Njideka
Akunyili 'O4) from whom he borrowed money to build his mini-empire
and now refuses to pay back. Amope's husband, Chume (Agbenyega),
has a chronic urge to beat his wife, for which Jero condemns him, demanding that he treat his wife decently. As Amope becomes more willing
to challenge Jero's rise, Jero begins to become more flexible.
In the second play, "Jero's Metamorphosis," Brother Jero begins to
challenge the local Salvation Army, with the help ofhis attractive young
secretary, Sister Rebecca (Nicola Woodroffe 'O3), to whom he dictates his
spiritual memos for other local priests. Brother Jero coerces the priests
into forming a union to challenge the Salvation Army and the corrupt
local Tourist Board in their domination of the beachside. At the end of
the play, it seems clear that he has persuaded them to fight alongside him
but for what final cause?
Both plays are stinging attacks on the detriments of organized religion and Christianity as a business. Jero blatantly states that the goal of
the church union is to "establish a spiritual monopoly" on the beachside.
The first play also shows Jero's corrupt rise to church leadership with
the support of a brainwashed Parliament member (Kwabena Adu '01),
who bends the rules for Jero and further augments his power.
Tancredi-Brice says the plays' religious issues brought her back to
her own experiences in Africa. "In Cameroon, where I was, the ideas of
prophets, magic and the open discussion of religion are very encouraged,"
...

she said. For Agbenyega, the play resonates with his personal experience of

African corruption. "The religious problem in Soyinka's play can be extrapolated from the current political problem, the corruption in Nigeria," he said.
"The Jero Plays" are intense and compelling, tackling, among others,
issues of power and religious corruption. But the bravest thing about the
production is the very fact that a woman from New York and a man from
Ghana have taken the political work ofa Nigerian exile into their own hands,
in an attempt to emphasize the international nature of the arts on campus.

'Memento': in
search of lost time

One drop of lavender ink
Eileen Myles writes with her undivided body and mind; she
writes as a lesbian but not exclusively for lesbians
BY MARY CAMPBELL

BY ESTER BLOOM
Time heals everything. Anyone who's been hurt knows that. But
what if time didn't pass, or, more specifically, what if you didn't feel
its movement? To what extent would you go to make yourself heal?
This is the central question in "Memento," an intelligent thriller
written and directed by Christopher Nolan. Leonard Selby (Guy
Pearce, looking just as lovely as he did blood-splattered in "L.A. Con-

fidential" and in drag in "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the
Desert") has lost all sense of the present. He is left with only a memory
of pain that does not diminish with time.
Every morning, Leonard wakes in a sparse hotel room, unaware
of what happened the previous day. He greets people whom he has
already met, in some cases numerous times. With a seemingly endless supply of patience and Buddha-like calm, he fills them in on the
details of his condition. A tragedy cost him his wife as well as his
short-term memory. Although he has no sense of how long ago she
was raped and killed, the crime remains the last thing he recalls.
People are amazed by his capacity to forget. Some abuse him; others perform tests. Unfazed, he sticks to his story. He remembers who
he used to be (an investigator for an insurance company in San Francisco) as well as everything that happened in his life previous to his
wife's death. He remembers his wife. He stillloves his wife. Now he
lives entirely for revenge.
To organize himself, he keeps Polaroids of each relevant person

WITH CLIFF'S NOTES ON EACH
INDIVIDUAL

As a part of Diversity Week, poet and writer Eileen
Myles spoke last Wednesday, reading from her latest
attempt at prose, her first novel "Cool For You." Before
delving into her prose, Myles introduced her new work
by reading a short selection of poems, one of which is
entitled "Porn Poems."
"This poem, I heard, made Adrienne Rich laugh."
Myles said in a faintly Boston accent, smiling as she
pushed her long brown, slightly-greyed hair out ofher
face and thumbed to the right page. "I have a friend who
knows Adrienne Rich's girlfriend. And Adrienne Rich's
girlfriend told my friend who told me that she heard
this laughing in the other room, and it was Adrienne
Rich reading this poem. Great, eh? My poem made
Adrienne Rich laugh!"
"Her tongue & her
Heart were

Throbbing
In the holster
Of her pussy."

Her work is daring. It is evocative.

Born in Cambridge, Mass, in 1949, Myles was educated in Catholic schools and eventually graduated from
the University of Massachusetts at Boston in 197 L She
moved to New York in 1974 to pursue a career in writing—to become a poet. And it was then that she began
to speak through her work. Loudly. In 1992, Myles even
announced her candidacy for the United States presi-

dency—a poet president. Engaging people in dialogue
has, for Myles, expanded beyond literature.
Before her reading, Joanne Gaskell, Ixel Cervera and
I had the opportunity to sit down and talk with Myles
about her work and the experience of writing:
So this is your first attempt at a novel? How did

this book come about?
"After I published "Chelsea Girls" [Myles' first book
of short stories] that summer [1994], well there are these
things you go through when you are a writer, and I
thought, "That's it. I am never going to write again.

That's it."

own" Cygnet), along with Cliffs notes on each individual. What one
character dubs "creepy tattoos" crisscross his chest— and arms,
thighs, and stomach in different font styles and sizes— marking the
progress of his quest. Some are inscribed backwards so he can read
themwhile standing before a mirror. He is searching, as his left bicep
reports, for either a John or James G. When new evidence surfaces,
he adds it wherever there is room.
The first frame showsLeonard shaking a picture he has just taken
of a man lying dead on the ground, his blood spreading on the concrete around his head like a second, more substantial shadow. Then
the film rewinds. We see the man fall; then Leonard firing the shot;
and finally the confrontation that led to the murder. The marked
man is Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), a short, unlikable man who insists
that he is both a cop and a friend. But the the orginal Polaroid that
Leonard has ofhim bears a contradictory message on the back: "Don't
believe his lies. He is the one. Kill him." As Leonard's handwriting is
all that is familiar to him anymore, it has the final say on this matter.
The film continues to unwind, repeating small segments for clarity's
sake, and it gives theviewer more clues, slowly revealin how Leonard
came to this conclusion. The key is Natalie (the versatile Carrie AnneMoss, totally unrecognizable from her recent role in "Chocolat") a tough
cocktail waitress who seems intrigued by Leonard. Her photograph
an artistic, melancholy shot ofher by a window—claims that "She has
lost someone too. She will help out of pity."
The more we learn, the more complicated the story becomes. Halfburnt Polaroids must be accounted for; mysterious contradictions
present themselves; and, along with Leonard, the audiencer is forced
to reevaluateeven the facts he willingly took for granted. Eventually
he must confront the most difficult question ofhis life: whetherthere
is any objective truth at all.
Although sometimes Leonard's internal monologues come off
as heavy-handed—and the film as a whole is about 10 minutes too
long— "Memento" is generally well paced, well acted, and exciting.
Like "The Sixth Sense" and "Fight Club," it begs to be watched at
least twice, for the intricacies of the plot as well as the quality of
the performances. Leonard, after all, will forget everything that transpired; it is left to the departing audience to question themselves
about whom and what we choose to trust, and why.

THE PHOENIX

So what did you do?
Well, I wrote a list of stories I would write if I could
write, and I picked one story off of that list, and I wrote
a novel.
"Cool for You" is just a series of short stories,
then?
Well, kind of, but I had a grand scheme when writing "Cool for You." Well, a couple ofthem. One of which
was institutions. I had that male outsider thing going
on. Every avant-garde malewriter is an outsider. And I
thought, well, I am not an outsider: I am a complete insider. Women are always contained by camp, schools
and relationships, jobs. Then I thought: a female outsider novel should be raving from the inside because
there were these cups, these institutions. They kind of
held you in as a girl... even gender itself held you in.
It ["Cool for You"] was an inventory of those places.
I was very miserable when I was writing the novel. And
I went back to this one place, and I felt kind of stuck. I
was kind of miserable when writing the novel. And I
thought, well, I got out of this once, I can get out if it
again. So, when the first draft was finished, it was really miserable."
Do you mean you or the book?
The book. It was just so depressing. And then I
thought "Okay, it wasn't all bad." So then I went back
and went to places that didn't have to do with survival,
but things that were glowing. I went to other kinds of
places. I was thinking black and white in a way. I
thought, "I had some bright, luminous spaces, too."
What do you mean by luminous places?
Like for instance, when I was a kid, I wanted to be an
astronaut; so there's a chapter in the book about the
solar system.
You said you went to camp? Is that in the book, as
well? Can you talk about camp a little bit?
Well, you know, that was the first time I knew I
had never had an all-girl education. It was this horrible
revelation, but it wasn't horrible. I was the youngest
...

counselor with the oldest cabin. So I was like 18 and
they were 14 year olds. Then I fell for a girl, and thenI
thought: Oh God, I am a lesbian. It wasn't like I never
had a clue, but I tried really hard not to.
Do you address issues of lesbianism in the book,
then?
It is not a lesbian book, per se, but you know how it
is. One little drop oflavender ink in the fish tank makes
the whole tank lesbian. It is sort of like when I was a
kid and we had this house in Boston. And we would
always rent to these young couples who would have
babies. So my mom wanted to sort of stop that cycle; so
we rented to these two older women. And they turned
out to be these two brawling dykes. Eventually, we
evicted them. That was the first time I was really exposed to lesbianism.
How do you feel about being identified as a
lesbian writer?
Well, I came out one or two years after I started writing poetry; so I think the two things are very linked.
You write with your whole undivided body and mind,
right? And so, how could my writing not be lesbian ifI
am a dyke? But I don't write exclusively for lesbians. It
is funny, like there is this chapter in my book: ifI write
about two lesbians walking through a field oftrees, does
that make my book a lesbian novel? You know, if we
were all lesbians, then maybe it would be lesbian.
The first time I ever went online, I went to an online
chat room for writers. I listened in for awhile, and then
I asked "Any dykes here?" And they were all like "wrong
room," and I thought "Do I have to go to my own room?"
It is not so much that lesbians are separatists, as that
people are always quick to tell you to go to your own
room or put her book in the lesbiansection. And it sort
of suggests that is not for everybody. I write about class.
I write about being female. About Massachusetts. And
a lot of my readers are boys and straight women. But
we all have to be filed away. I think the closet exists
more of a filing system now, but that, in and of itself, is
completely depressing.

As the culture gets bigger and bigger, we get further separated and segregated. And we get further divided along all lines. So the only guy who gets to feel
like he is a part ofit all is some big, white, rich guy.
When did you decide that you wanted to write a
novel?
When I was in college, I took writing classes, and I
was always interested in prose. I wanted to write novels. I think I wanted to write novels more than I wanted
to write poems.

So why did you end up writing poetry?
I guess
in my poems I am trying to be here. It is
sort oflike in a way, poetry is a way of being embodied.
I always intended to write novels. But didn't for a
variety of reasons. One was youth and metabolism, attention span. It was sort of like I really very deliberately went to New York. By thetime I went to New York,
I was a 24-year old poet. Then there were waitressing
jobs and poems and subway rides. And then it was just
a matter oftime. You could sit on the subway and write
a poem.
I would always say I was going to write a novel. I
was going to leave New Yorkand go to Seattleand write
a novel. But it was never like I was going to write it in
New York. It was always somewhere else.
So when did you decide you wanted to be a
writer?
I had just gotten out of college. I think I started I
think it was when I had this job at the publishing company, Little Brown in Boston, and I was one of those
throngs of English majors not sure of what to do, so
they take a job in publishing. But I had this typewriter
in front ofme all day, and I always wrote poems at work.
And they were awful. But one day I wrote this poem
that was good. And I thought, this poem is my job and
this job is nothing.
What happened to that poem? Did you publish it?
I still have it but never published it. It was called
...

...

"Swan Song."

What was it about?
About what it is about to be young and trying to
decide what to do with your life. Writing the poem and
deciding to be a poet were, for me, the same thing.

PLAYER OF THE WEEK
Pete Schilla 'Ol
Sport: Men's Tennis
Position: No. 1 singles, No. 1 doubles with John Thomas 'O2
Hometown/H.S.: Sacramento, CA/Jesuit
Major: Honors political science with a history minor.
When the Swarthmore men's tennis team clashed with Emory at
Washington & Lee this past weekend, few in the know expected
the Garnet to emerge with a win. And it didn't.
But No. 1 singles player Pete Schilla 'Ol pulled off one of the
biggest upsets of the past decade for Swarthmore, knocking off
Emory's Brett Kaplan, the second-ranked player in the nation.
But that wasn't all. With partner John Thomas 'O2, Schilla took
down Emory's No. 1 doubles team of Kaplan and Mike Miller
the top team in the South region and No. 5 in the nation.
With the singles win, Schilla all but sewed up a berth in the ITA
Tennis individual national tournament in May.

Track and field steps it up at
home and away at Haverford
BY MARK JANOFF
The Swarthmore track and field team competed locally
the past two weekends, hosting the Swarthmore Invitationaland attending the Quadrangular Meet at Haverford.
At the Swarthmore Invitational, the men and the women
notched team scores of 105 and 102, respectively at the. Because ofa recent spate of injuries, however, the teams fared
less favorably overall at the Haverford meet. "Some of our
runners did not run last weekend [at Haverford] due to
injury or fatigue," Sarah Jay 'Ol noted, "but we are hoping
to get back in fighting shape soon."
At the Swarthmore Invitational, Marc Jeuland 'Ol
placed first in the men's 800-meter with a time of 2:00.40.
In his usual form, Kwaku Ntoso 'O3 placed first in both
men's hurdle events, finishing the 110-meter in 1610 seconds and completing the 400-meter in 1:0L10. In the men's
discus throw, Mat Rapoza 'O3 placed first with a 110'04.00"

mark.

The women were certainly at their best at the
Swarthmore Invitational. In the women's 800-meter, Claire
Hoverman 'O3 and Jay finished first and second respectively. Joko Agunloye 'Ol placed first in the women's 1500meter with a time of 5:05.20. Most impressive was Imo
Akpan 'O2, who placed first in both the women's 100-meter
and 200-meter with respective times of 12.60 and 25.80.
Amazingly, Akpan repeated her dominantachievement the

following weekend at Haverford. At that tournament, times
of 12.57 and 25.67 carried her to first-place performances
in the women's sprinting events.
In the men's 1500-meter at Haverford, Jeuland placed
third in a competitive race, finishing in just under four
minutes. Ambrose Dieringer 'Ol notched a personal best
in the men's 800-meter with a time of 2:04.35. Dieringer
cited his parents as his sources of inspiration. "My parents were going to attend the meet last Saturday, but at

the last moment my mom was unable to come
because of illness. Knowing that my dad had
driven hours to see his kid run, while his wife
was sick at home, I knew I had to put on a good
show," Dieringer said. "I decidedthat a little over
two minutes of fleeting pain was a miniscule
price to pay for glory
glory that will dwell in
my heart long after my legs cease to crave the
exhilaration of competition."
The women's team also performed well, despite the recent injury epidemic. In the women's
5000-meter, Swarthmore finished first, second,
and third. Njideka Akunyili 'O4 placed first in
the women's 400-meter, edging the competition
with a time of 1:0139. In the field events, Clara
Fuchsman 'Ol posted a personal best 35' 7" in the
women's shot put. "Throwing 35 feet has been
my goal for the past two years," Fuchsman said.
"I threw well because for once I was not thinking about it. I did not even realize I had thrown
that far until the official read the distance." Adding some kind words about her teammates,
Fuchsman added, "All the throwers consistently
throw well. We support each other." With that
throw, Fuchsman placed first in the shot put. She
also finished sixth in the women's discus at the

meet.
Although the outdoor track season has only
recently begun, Jay is proud of her teammates.
"I'm really inspired by the work ethic of my
by
teammates
and
am
amazed
the successes many of them have already had
this early in the season," Jay noted.

and provided the margin of victory for the Buz-

Last Saturday March 3L the Swarthmore women's tennis team
handily defeated the Franklin and Marshall Diplomats 7-2, ending
F&M's 44 Centennial Conference match winning streak. Driven inside the Mullan Center by inclement weather, the Garnet swept the
doubles matches and pummelled the Dips at first, second, third and
sixth singles. F&M has won the conference championship for the last
four years and hadn't been defeated in a conference match since April
16, 1996, when they lost to Gettysburg College in the conference finals. According to head coach Dan Sears, Saturday's match was "the
most important match for Swarthmore in 5 years." Powered by the
undefeated doubles teams of Jen Pao 'Ol/Laura Swerdlow 'O2, Anjani
Reddy 'O4/ Caroline Celano 'O4, and Kristina Pao 'O4/Katherine Voll
'O3, the Garnet came away victorious by the healthy margin of 7-2.
In first doubles, Swerdlow and Jen Pao pulled out a huge 8-6 victory
in one of their closest and most nerve-wracking matches of the season.
Other stellar performances included Reddy's 6-0, 6-2 defeat of the Dips'
Jenny Smith at first singles. Celano dominated at second singles with a
6-4, 6-2 win. At sixth singles, Voll fought for a hard-earned victory in a
third set tiebreak, to win 7-5, 7-6 (2).
Yesterday the Garnet faced Gettysburg College, the only other undefeated team in the conference. Despite a lineup hit hard by class commitments, Swarthmore pulled out a 6-3 win. With her 6-0,6-0 win at first
singles, Reddy is now a perfect 10-0 on the season. Krista Hollis 'Ol made
a cameo appearence with Reddy at first doubles, winning 8-4.
Now 6-0 in the conference, the Garnet look ahead to a road trip to
Dickinson College on April 7. The Red Devils are currently 3-6 over all,
and 0-3 in the Centennial Conference.

The game was also dirty because Albright had
apparently never played rugby before, and came
out swinging. After asking that the halves be
shortened because of their poor level of conditioning, Albright showed that while they might
not be able to run far, they could throw some
decent punches, resulting in several minor inju-

ries and two near-fights. When Albright chose
to head home after the game rather than attend
".he social, there were no teary eyes on the
Swarthmore team.

On Saturday, the men's rugby team played in its dirtiest match yet this year, emerging with a strong victory
over Albright, 19-12.
The game was dirty both literally and figuratively. The
rain of the previous week had left the field completely saturated, and about a quarter of the field was actually under
water. After the two women's games, DuPont field was completely ripped up.
Nevertheless, the men played solid defense all around
and were able to limit Albright to two quick tries. The offense was less successful, scoring only one try off a quick
penalty play by captain Pablo Montagnes 'O2. Fortunately,
Swarthmore was able to rely on the accuracy of fullback
Diego Johnson 'O2, who was 4-4 when kicking for points

From MEN'S LAX, pg. 24
Garnetoffense could only muster one goal from Court in the fourth
quarter. Co-captain Blake Atkins 'O2 won 10 of 14 faceoffs to help
the offense gain valuable possessions during the game.
Yesterday's game against Ursinus provided an opportunity for
Swarthmore to settle down and put it all together. This is Ursinus'

first year competing at the varsity level, and the Garnet shut out
the Bears 17-0. Dingfield settled into a scoring groove, with five
goals and one assist. Court ran the settled attack with three goals
and five assists. DeSimone tallied three, while Atkins, John
Murphy 'O3, Smith, Chris Murphy 'O4, Eric Stephens 'O3 and Dan

Ingersoll 'O3 each scored once. Swarthmore had 42 shots to
Ursinus' four. In goal, Reily split time with Steve Isbister 'O4 to
record the shutout. Swarthmore is now 3-4 on the season.
Six games into the season, Dingfield (14 goals, 7 assists) sits at

Both Swarthmore women's rugby teams lost in disappointing
upsets to Temple University. The A-side fell 12-9, and B-side lost 12-5.
A-side played a hard-hitting game, moving the ball impossibly close
to the try line without scoring. After holding Temple in a deadlock
during the first 15 minutes ofthe game, Swarthmore was the first to
score with a penalty kick. Scrumhalf Nancy Craig 'Ol nailedthe kick
right through the uprights from the sidelines 40 meters back. Craig
made two more penalty kicks, scoring all nine points for A-side.
Swat played a tough game, and neither side dominated. The ball
moved back and forth across the field in both teams' possession.
Temple managed to push it into the try zone twice and converted
once for the win.
B-side also had a physical game against Temple. The Swarthmore
rookies rose to the challenge and were indistinguishable from the
veterans. Temple's speedy fullback scored the first try of the game.
Swat stepped up their defense and allowed Temple's best B-side athlete to score only once more. Temple converted the first try.
During the second half, Dani Holt-Lyman 'O3 moved the ball 10
meters away from the tryline in an impressive eight-man pickup.
Amanda Cravens 'O4 received the ball from the forwards and scored
her first try and Swarthmore's only try of the game.

12th-ranked Warmothers aim for nationals
BY ANNA MASILELA

The Warmothers, the women's ultimatefrisbee team, may
have spent spring break in Florida, but they're hoping to celebrate the end of school farther north, in Massachusetts. The
2001 Ultimate Players Association College Ultimate Championships-Women's Division will be held May 25-27 in Boston
this year. The Warmothers, currently ranked No. 12 in the
nation by the UPA, are expecting to make the cut for thethird
year in row.
The women's team was formed in 1994by Lena Loewenthal
'97 and Courtney Harter '97. There was already a men's ultimate frisbee team on campus that was becoming increasingly
coed. With women's frisbee gaining more participants nationwide, Loewenthal and Harter decided that Swarthmore
women needed a team oftheir own. Since the men were called
the Earthworms, an anagram for Swarthmore, the women
decided to continue the theme and called themselves the
Warmothers. When playing in coed tournaments, they go with
the more cheeky Smartwhores.
According to the UPA Rules of Ultimate (ninth edition),
ultimate is a non-contact sport played by two seven-player
teams. The disc may only be moved by passing as thethrower
is not allowed to take any steps. Any time a pass is incomplete, intercepted or knocked down, or if it contacts an out-ofbounds area, a turnover occurs, resulting in an immediate
change ofpossession of thedisc. A goal is scored when a player
successfully passes the disc to a teammate in the endzone that
team is attacking. Each halfis 24 minutes long, and a 10-minute
halftime occurs when 11 goals have been scored. The game
ends when one team has 21 goals with a margin of two goals
over the other team. Otherwise, the game goes into five-minute
overtime periods until one team has the winning edge. The
captains' clause allows the game to be played under any variation of the rules as agreed upon by the two team captains.
The Warmothers started the trek to Boston in the fall by
implementing a mandatory conditioning plan a frisbee-specific version of the women's lacrosse team's regimen. Now
they're out on Mertz field, practicing weekdays on what they
all agree is the worst field on campus. "The college has been
so supportive. Anything we've asked for has been given to
us," said co-captain Jenny Hoedeman 'Ol, "But we really need
a new field Mertz just gives us bad ankles and knees."
Anna Stratton 'O4, who started playing frisbee during fall
break, decided not to play lacrosse, a sport she played in high
school, in order to compete with the Warmothers this spring.
"Frisbee is awesome. It's a new kind of sport, a different kind
of sport," she said. "After games, we'll make up cheers for the
other team. We'll take a song, like [Britney Spears' "Baby One
More Time"] and change the words so that we can pick out
the good things the other team did in a game. The other teams
get all excited. It's fun and sportsmanlike
we're competitive, but then there's a relaxed side to things."
Some Warmothers are former varsity athletes who quit
their teams in order to play frisbee. Others play when their
sport is in the offseason. Still others had no experience in
organized sports before they joined. What attracts them all is
the frisbee philosophy, what they call "the spirit of the game."
Although die Warmothers are self-conscious about the mantra, they take the idea very seriously. According to Hoedeman,
it's about players who take responsibility for their own actions on the field. Frisbee is played without referees, so players have to call their own fouls. The Warmothers have no
coach, so players decide individually how much they can contribute to the team. "Frisbee is unique in that it allows us to
celebrate our own achievements while appreciating those
-

...

of others," said Hoedeman.
For Carolynn Laurenza 'O3, who quit soccer her freshman

Claire Weiss Phoenix Staff

~.

Anna Stratton 'O4 leaps above teammate Carolynn Laurenza
year to focus exclusively on frisbee, it was all about falling in
love with the mentality. "You push yourself as much as you can,
but it's all inside yourself— you're not under pressure to prove
anything to an authority figure," she said 'and that's pretty powerful." Playing for coaches who evaluated her performance and
decidedhow long she could play made her feel she was trying to
prove something to someone else. "In frisbee, it's more about
how well you know the game," she said. "Even someone who
isn't [very] athletic can kick a really fast person's ass by making
the right cut."
The Warmothers'level ofexpertise and experience increased
dramatically in 1996 when co-captains Lindsay Goldsmith 'Ol and
Julia Trippel 'Ol entered as freshmen. Goldsmith, who came from
the New York metropolitan area, and Trippel, who hadlived near
Boston, had both played extensively in high school. "That sort of
experience is hard to come by," said Hoedeman. "I learned everything I knew about frisbee from Lindsay, and so did the rest
of the team."
Goldsmithand Hoedeman became co-captains their sophomore year and began the sometimes difficult transition to making the Warmothers into a nationally recognized force.
"Frisbee used to be something that people did in their spare
time, just for fun, and they didn't see it as a real sport," said
Hoedeman. "Now, it's a real sport. Our players know that they
can no longer be a valuable part of the team if they aren't 100
percent committed."
The main season for the Warmothers is the spring, during
the college series. The tournaments are concentrated in March,

'O3 to snag a frisbee during a recent practice.
April and May, when the team plays six to eight two-hour
games every weekend at tournaments. In the fall, the team
has the option to compete in theclub series, created for players who have already graduated from college. "We can compete," said Hoedeman, "but we don't really have a chance."
The team plays in the Pennsylvania region and
progresses into the Metro-East region that includes
women's college teams along the East Coast from the New
York City area down to Washington, D.C. Bucknell College is a strong competitor in the region and qualified for
nationals last year, as did Swarthmore.
The UPA, in the college division, is broken up into eight
regions, and each region is further subdivided into sections.
Any college team, provided that all players meet the eligibilityrequirements, may compete in theirSectional tournament.
Depending on the number of teams competing, the top teams
at Sectionals qualify for their Regional championships. A
maximum of 16 teams in each division may play at the
Regionals. The top finisher(s) atRegionals, depending on wild
card allocation, qualify to compete in the UPA College Championships. According to Hoedeman, the top two teams from
each region there are eight regions move on to the cham-

The Warmothers will be challenging Bucknell and UNC

Men's tennis team secures national bid with win over W&L
BY FRANK VISCIANO
It was a big weekend for the Swarthmore men's tennis
team. In back-to-back matches against Emory and Washington & Lee, the Garnetfaced two perennial regional and national powerhouses in a must-win situation with a bid to the
NCAA Div. m National Tournament on the line. The top four
ranked teams in the region qualify for the regional bracket.
With Emory sitting at No. 1 and Washington & Lee at No. 3,
the Garnet needed a win to ensure a spot in the top four.
Needing to steal one win from two tough opponents, the
team knew the weekend would be a challenge. Hoping to get
a taste ofthe pressure they would face in the coming matches,
Swat piled in a van sardine-style and underwentthe six-hour

trip to Washington & Lee in Lexington, Va.
First up was Emory University, a team bragging No. 5 national ranking and led by two singles players ranked in the top

fifteen. Although Swarthmore fought hard, the team eventually
fell to a conference-leading Emory 6-1 The lone win of the day
came from captain Pete Schilla 'Ol at first singles. Schilla faced

Emory's Brett Kaplan, ranked seventh nationally coming into
the spring season. Despite being manhandled in the first set,
Schilla battled back, slowly gaining momentum, and rolled
through the next two sets to win 3-6,6-3,6-2.
Following one night's rest, Swat went to work against Washington & Lee. If the team wanted to clinch a nationals birth for
the spring season, a win was crucial. After dropping the doubles
point in spite of a win at second doubles by Scott Grant 'Ol and

Jayson Yost 'O3, Swarthmore needed four out of six singles
wins. Thanks to enormous efforts by Schilla, John Thomas
'O2 and Justin Singer 'O3, the Garnet pulled even at three points
apiece. The most exciting and important match of the weekend, and perhaps the season, fell on the shoulders of Scott
Grant 'Ol Shaking off a weak first set, Grant stepped up to
win the match by a score of 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, giving Swarthmore
the edge over Washington & Lee 4-3 and clinching a trip to
the regional bracket of the national tournament. The Garnet
is now ranked third in the southern region.
Boosted by the win, the team prepares for another busy
weekend against Trinity (Conn.) on Friday, April 6, and Rochester on Sunday, April 8. Matches begin at 3 p.m. and 11 a.m.,

respectively.

SUZANNE

SUZANNE VS.
THE WORLD
Suzanne Wilis a cocky, immature, chain-smoking, barely coherent bitch who doesn't think you can beat her at your own
game. Ifyou don't mind getting your ass beat down and then
living with the subsequent embarrassment, challenge her by
writing to phoenix@swarthmore.edu.

Hello. It is I, Michael Pasahow, Suzanne's loyal and subservient and red-headed photographer. This week I was
forced to tag along while Suzanne faced inevitable defeat
once again. My life is completely devoid of any meaning independent of following Suzanne around. Sigh.
Anyhoo, so Su, as I irritatingly refer to her despite the
fact that she pointedly refers to herself as Suzanne, got challenged to a best-of-five game of skee-ball and a round of puttputt golf by Greg Erskine, who is the hunkiest nerd ever.
Ever. You may think that fifth-grade birthday party games
do not a real challenge make, but let me tell you, Greg has
some wicked guns. Su was in for it. Here, I'll just standoff to
the side, fiddling with my flash, feigning interest until Su
can't take the humiliation anymore and concedes the game.

Part One: Shame
Everyone in the car is smoking cigarettes. It is so disgusting. They even stop to buy more cigarettes. Su thinks she is
being nice and she rolls down the window. This just makes
the ash fly around the car and onto my nice leather jacket.
Please god, just let me die. I just stare out the window and
listen to Greg tell a story about how healmost drowned in the
Crum. What a 'tard. Obviously, if you're swirling in rapids,
you should flatten yourself out so that your feet don't get
caught between some rocks, causing the current to push you
against the river bottom. I volunteer this bit of knowledge.
No one seems impressed. Su is laughing really hard at something Greg just said. Why does she not laugh hard at things I
say? I resume staring out the window.

Challenged Su grabs first win
In skee-ball, Su proves victorious. In putt-putt, it's another matter.
We arrive at the golf and games place on Baltimore Pike. I
hurry inside while Greg and Su stay outside and talk and try
desperately to get an archaic Flash lighter to work in the wind.
I see a Time Crisis II console. My heart skips a beat. I quickly
become engrossed in shooting at masked men who are trying
to thwart my mission. I do not notice Su and Greg come in. I do
not notice them feeding dollar bills into the change machine
right next to me, and I ignore the clank of the quarters and Su
saying, "Hey bitch. We're starting now." I focus only on the

terrorists.

Su starts to make funny grunting victory noises. I take my
eyes off the video game for a brief instant while I reload and
look over. Oh my god. She's winning. The score is 240 to 170.
Greg needs to make it in one ofthe corner holes worth 100points.

IT BEGINS AGAIN. THE
HUMILIATION. THE FUTILITY. SU'S
PLEADING FOR ME TO HELP HER
CHEAT.
He cups the ball like a fragile snow globe, caressing it, and releases it up the ramp at a diagonal. It bounces off the rim of the

100-point hole and lingers for a bit before rolling down for a

meager 10 points. Su obnoxiously gloats and does a little victory dance, but I immediately forgive her. It is a minor moment of triumph for her: fleeting and rare. This has been an
impossibly long reload. I go back to my game.
"Hey photo whore," Su says. "It's over. I won 5-2. Why didn't
you take any pictures?"
I snap myself out of my Time Crisis-induced stupor and feel
shame. I am a lousy photojournalist. I have failed to "capture
the moment." Su and Greg count up their tickets. They need

four more tickets to trade for a rubber ducky. They decide to
play one last game. I take many, many blurry photos. I blame
the lighting in the arcade.

Michael Pasahow Phoenix Staff

Suzanne "The Mangier" Wu flexes her neck and tries to
look tough after racking up her first win.

Part Two: Redemption
Su and Greg head
the golf course and pick putters
and colored golf balls. Su grabs the green ball. A wise choice.
She is off to a good start already. Greg is left to pout and settles
for the reject red ball. They head to the hardest course and Su
tees up on the little foam mat. This course doesn't look that
hard, and Su looks confident, fresh from her win in skee-ball.
She stands above the ball, legs shoulder length apart, and connects. For the first time in my period of servitude, I am proud
of the lazy bitch. The ball rolls right towards the hole, rolls
over it, bounces off the back bumper and rolls right back down
the green, stopping not two inchesfrom whereit started. Alack,
alas, 'twas not to pass.
It begins again. The humiliation. The futility. Su's pleading
for me to help her cheat.
Meanwhile, Greg's "putt-putt blood starts boiling" and he
begins sinking pars like I usually sink punchlines. Su almost

Suzanne and Greg square off at putt-putt golf.
makes a comeback on the 17thhole when Greg hits his little
red ball into the nasty barely-filled water trap twice. He opens
his mouth in iconographic surprise and groans dejectedly.
Something about Greg puts Su in a really good mood, and
she keeps twirling around and laughing so hard her eyes
squint. She doesn't even seem to mind when, on the 18th
hole, Greg lines up his shot perfectly and hits an uphill holein-one, beating her 55-60. Su looks at her watch. It is 7:05. "I
had class at 7:00," she says evenly before making a sudden
mad dash for her car.
"Su," I plead. "Drive safe." I don't think she hears me.
We all hop into the car and speed through the parking lot.
Part Three: Su's Coda
Look, I'm not expecting you to care, but I just want it to
be known that I am in love with Greg Erskine. That boy is a
klutzy, awkward, retro-coiffed screwball mess of one-liners,
unbelievable stories aboutnear-deathand comic book trivia,
which is to say that he is, quite simply, wonderful.
You may be right. So maybe skee-bsdl isn'tmuch of sport,
and putt-putt golf is really just plain lame. But I sort of just
wanted to con Greg into spending time with me. And not
just because I knew I might finally break my losing streak.

Sho'women sealed their current Conference ranking as one notchabove the Garnet.

Midfielder Jackie Khan eludes Ursinus and heads
toward the goal. Khan scored two goals during
Tuesday's 10-8 loss to Ursinus.

"It's unfortunate that the score didn't
reflect how really tight the game was. We
played a solid game," saidmidfielder Meg
Woodworth 'O3.
With Wednesday's loss behind them,
the Lady Laxers hit the road on Saturday, March 31 as they traveled to Carlisle,

Pa., homeof the DickinsonDevils. Backed
by a loyal yet vociferous contingent of
fans, including localand visiting parents,

Swarthmore

easily

defeated Dickinson

College, 16-11 Katie Tarr 'O2 played some
particularly fierce offense as she racked
up eight goals and one assist, and was
named the Centennial Conference
Women's Lacrosse Player ofthe Week for

her efforts. Attacker Erika Williams 'Ol
tickledthe twinefive times, a career high
for the starting second home.
The Garnet then prepared to face
Ursinus, currently ranked sixth in the
nation in Division 111, on Tuesday, April
3. With confidence and heart, not to mention speed and aim, Swarthmore's offense
dished out quite a beating to an unsuspecting Ursinus defense. The Garnet defense held down the fort as Swarthmore

and Ursinus traded goals throughout
the game. At the half, scoring remained even at 4-4.
Following some excellent shots by
Jackie Kahn 'O4, Mavis Biss 'O2 and
Williams, the Garnet gained a healthy
three-goal lead. Yet Ursinus dug deep
as they scored five unanswered goals
withlittle time left in the game to beat

the Garnet by a margin reminiscent
of the previous week's battle against
Washington College. Despite the final
score of 10-8, the Lady Laxers
outplayed the Bears for the majority
of the game. The team will only use
this loss to gain momentum as they
head into the heart of the season, including Saturday's home match-up
against nationally ranked Gettysburg
College. Game time is 1 p.m.

Men's lacrosse splits games against
Stevens Tech and Western Maryland

There is so much to discuss, sports fans, and oh so
little time. Or column space.
Like, for instance, how funny it would be to dress Presi-

dent Al Bloom up in big baggy yellow pants with rainbowcolored suspenders and make him do somersaults on
Parrish lawn during spec weekend as part of Swat's new
"wild and crazy fun everyday" publicity campaign.
Or how Kenny Clark, the leading rusher in the history of
Swarthmore College football, should take on Emily the Running Girl, in a contest ofboth speed and endurancerunning.
Or how there should be more midgets around here

and a lot fewer vegetarians.
Which leads me to something else I want to talk
about. The weather last weekend was awful. Which
means everybody stayed in their rooms all weekend.
Which I thought was especially timely, because so many
parents were around. Now they'll finally understand
what you mean when you describe the weekends around
here as "mind-numbingly boring." They used to ask you,
"So people must get off campus on the weekends or something?" Now they'll just say, "Yeah, sorry. College didn't
suck like that for me."
Parents are so understanding. I love parents. Especially moms.
I was watching the Maryland-Duke game last Saturday night before the DU party with big Mat Rapoza. And
for all of you who were watching, you'll remember the
collision between Chris Duhon of Duke and Steve
"Whitey" Blake of Maryland, which ended with Duhon
slamming his head violently on the hardwood court.
After he got up and staggered into the locker room, the
cameraman panned over into the crowd. There was
Duhon's mom making her way through the crowd to go
see her son, a pleasant-looking lady with as much Duke
paraphernalia on her plump 5'5" body as humanly possible. Mat turned to me and said, "Now that's a mom."

SOMETIMES IT'S A PROBLEM
HAVING A GOOD-LOOKING MOM,
EXCEPT WHEN YOU CONSIDER
GETTING GOOD GENES AND SO
FORTH.
And he was right. That was a mom. A great mom.
But there can also be a dark side to mothers coming
to your sporting events, as my buddy Michael DeFillipo
well knows. Unfortunately for Mike, his mom is highly
attractive for a mom (or so the rumor goes). Which is
something that gets mentioned on a regular basis and
is a source of "many a well-aimed piece of witticism."
I remember that Gerlitz thought my mom was an espe-

cially good-looking mom. He'd always ask, "Laney," (he
called me that) "is your mom coming to the game today?"
It's a troubling conflict of interest: you want your
mom to come to your games, but afterwards everyone
makes fun of you. Sometimes it's a problem having a
good-looking mom, except when you consider getting
good genes and so forth.
On that note, ladies and gentlemen, go play a sport for

your mom so she can come and watch. That's what moms
do best. Let your mom reach her full potential as a mom.
Even if she's a hottie, even ifthe sport you play is a strangely
feminine sport like lacrosse, get out there and let her cheer.
Finally, I've often thought that I wish Al Bloom had
been a mom. Obviously it's against the nature of motherhood to cut something like Swarthmorefootball. But then
I think about how ugly his kids wouldbe, and how blackened and cold their hearts would be, and I think, maybe
its better after all that football was cut, rather than to
have Al Bloom procreating and nurturing children.
Those are my thoughts. Go have another wild and
crazy fun weekend, sports fans.

Than Court drives past a Western Maryland defender in last Saturday's game. The Garnet was behind by just one goal
at halftime, but a disasterous defensive third quarter sealed the deal for the Terror. Swarthmore lost 15-6.

Going into yesterday's game against Ursinus, the Garnet was 2-4 on the season. Now,
leading scorer Mark Dingfield has been named to the Centennial Conference Honor Roll.
BY MIKE LLOYD

The Swarthmore men's lacrosse team split their two games last week to bring theirrecord to 2-4. On Wednesday, March
28, the men traveled to Hoboken, New Jersey and beat Stevens Tech 6-5. Then on Saturday, March 31, they dropped their
first conference game of the season to Western Maryland 15-6 on a sloppy Clothier Field.
Joe DeSimone 'O4 led the Garnet Tide with three goals to beat the Crusaders of Stevens Tech. Both teams' defenses
played well in a close battle. The game was locked in a 5-5 tie with three minutes remaining in the game when Than Court
'O3 caused a turnover during a riding situation. DeSimone picked up the ground ball and passed the ball to co-captain Mark
Dingfield 'OL Dingfield made a quick move to the goal and ended the nice play with the game winner. The Crusaders'
attempts to tie the game in the closing moments were hampered when they committed a holding penalty that gave the ball
to Swarthmore in the last minute of the game. Including his game-winner, Dingfield scored two goals against the Crusaders. John Cleaver 'O4 also scored for the Garnet Tide. Goalkeeper CJ Riley 'Ol anchored the defense and recorded 10 saves
between the pipes.
Coming off the win, the Garnet had high hopes in the Centennial Conference opener against powerhouse Western
Tom Brown, Joe Ellis
Maryland. The Terror sports a high-powered attack that returned all three oflast year's starters
and Brett Sweeney. Swarthmore was unable to best the Terror and lost 15-6, despite a well-played first half.
The first halfof the game may have been the best that the Garnet has played this season. For every goal that Western
Maryland scored, Swarthmore responded with a goal of their own. Dingfield had two goals in the first half, as well as goals
by Coby Smith 'O2, DeSimone and John Murphy 'O3. Even though the Terror took a 6-5 lead going into the end of the second
quarter, the Garnet players felt good about their chances in the second half. Unfortunately, the house of cards came tumbling down. Everything that seemed to go right in the first half went wrong in the second. Turnovers, penalties, and
confusion plagued the offense and the defense. Western Maryland's attack unit came out firing in the third quarter, outscoring
the Garnet 6-0. With a spectacular 16 saves, Riley kept the scoring run down by stopping several one-on-one situations. The
