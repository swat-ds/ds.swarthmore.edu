An Overview of Wisdom and the Healing Arts From the Provost's Perspective
By

Erik Huneke

An open meeting held by Provost
Jennie Keith and Joy Charlton, chair
ofthe sociology/anthropology department, on April 19 was the latest milestone in the deliberation over whether
or not to re-offer the Wisdom and the
Healing Arts course, also known as
Sociology/Anthropology 15, taught
by Dr. Howard Posner.
In an interview on April 23, Keith
said, "At this point, my decision is
that we are not going to re-offer [the
course]."
Keith notes that Wisdom and the
Healing Arts was at first conceived as
a temporary offering in the sociology/anthropology department.
Posner's offer to teach the course
coincided withthe department's need
for extra courses to account for a
faculty member on maternity leave
and another performing administrative work. The course was offered
four additional times.
This past fall, Dr. Posner, who has
two children currently attending
Swarthmore, inquired about the possibility of a permanent teaching posi-

tion.Posner said, "The experience of
teaching at Swarthmore was extremely fulfilling for me and the students. I felt somewhat tenuous being
renewed on an annual basis."
By this point, the department no
longer needed to fill any ofits teaching slots with temporary courses.
Keith noted further that "to create a
position is a very major process, involving the CEP, the faculty, and the
budget."
Posner stated that he "did not obviously in any way give an ultimatum
to them...l just assumed if they
couldn't find a permanent position,
the year-to-year renewal would continue."
Since there was no money left to
fund the course, President Al Bloom
offered to fund the course from his
discretionary fund until a longer-term
solutioncould be reached; Keith notes
that "he was very clear that the faculty had to think this was a responsible thing to do." These discretionary funds, however, were never in
fact used to fund the course.
A longer-term solution, according
to Keith, entailed finding a "home"

for the course within one of the
College's academic departments.
After weeks of discussion, the sociology/anthropology department, under which the course had been classified during its temporary status, decided not to offer the course again
because "it doesn't draw sufficiently
on the paradigms and materials of
sociology and anthropology," according to Keith. Keith also noted that Dr.
Posner was not a sociologist or anthropologist. Furthermore, most students taking the course were premed, not students from the department itself. When Keith approached
the biology and religion departments
about offering the course, they both
declined.
Posner saw the need for greater
flexibility, noting that his course
draws from "philosophy, religion,
biology, anthropology, [and]
linguistics. ..When you are being truly
multicultural and multidisciplinary,
it is impossible for you to be
cubbyholed into one discipline or
department."
Donna Jo Napoli, chair of the LinguisticsDepartment, offered to house

the course. Keith noted thatafter they
both agreed that the course did not
have an "authentic place" in the linguistics curriculum, they decided that
"the principle of giving [the course] a
home would not be enough of a rationale" for pursuing this option further.
Napoli agreed "that this is the reason
that Linguistics cannot house the
course. But...Linguistics has only one
tenure-track line, and we' ve had only
one tenure-track line for 22 years.
I've been asking for a second full
tenure-trackline for a long time.That
proposal is now up before the administration. In that proposal you can
find a clear outline of what courses
Linguistics needs to offerand why—and what kind of faculty could cover
those courses. Jennie and I agreed
that if I were to claim that Howard
Posner was offering something crucial to Linguistics, I would undermine my own proposal. I can't do
that. I have to protect the proposal. I
have to keep a perspective that will
allow Linguistics to thrive here."
Both Keith and Posner have received many letters from students
about the course. Many of the letters

Elections Bring New
Student Participation
Salerno

Whether or not you voted for Stu-

dent Council candidates this week,
you probably noticed the effort SC
was making to solicit your participation in Swarthmore's democraticprocess. A voting booth, in the form of
a laptop computer, was available for
voters upstairs in Sharpies for the
first time and students were personally and loudly asked to cast their
ballot. On Wednesday, in Sharpies
Room 4, a "Meet the Candidates"
question and answer session was facilitated by current members of SC.
Last week The Phoenix published a
supplement allowing the candidates
to present their platforms as responses
to questions posed by SC. The Phoenix also posed a question for all the
candidates to research and answer,
announced the question and answer
session, and gaveinstructions on how
to vote via Telnet.
The actions taken to build student
interest in Student Council elections,
according to Joseph Goodman '97 of
the SC, are "becoming progressively
louder" and mark the "first time SC
has taken an active role" in publicizing itself. Will Nessly '99, also a
current SC officer, acknowledged that
although Swarthmore students "feel
strongly about student issues [such
as] campus groups, chartering, budgets, and appointments" there is not
the understanding that "Student
Council has apart in all ofthat...[and]
Student Council controls a whole lot

of money."
However, some Swarthmore students avoided the voting booth, and
even eye contact with the SC members who were urging themto participate. A feeling ofalienation from the
enthusiasm of the SC was evident
among the student body. Many students gave the evening's Tori Amos
concert as an excuse to hurry quickly
by and not stop to vote. Others solicited assured the SC officers that they

had already voted.
Yet other students spent a good
deal of time choosing their candidates. Said Wonju Kim '9B, "This
[the election] is so much more public.
I might as well vote." A change has
occurred, bringing theSC a step closer
to the Swarthmore student community. Still, for some students, the role
and power ofSC is a hidden mystery.
Students have complained that the
complicated titles, such as "Student
Observer to the Board of Managers",
obscure rather than illuminate the
work that SC does. Mariah Peele '99
put off voting and articulated a common feeling saying she did not "feel
comfortable voting when I don'tknow
anything about [the candidates]."
At the Meet the Candidates Question and Answer Session, all the candidates but two sat in a very warm,
very empty room to answer questions
and discuss issues. At most, six nonSC members were present at any given
time and students who wandered in
tended to stay rather than create a
constantly new audience listening to
the candidates. Ironically enough,
outreach to campus groups and the
student body at large, was the issue
that dominated the discussion.
Kristen Jones '97, candidate for
the College Planning Committee, expressed concern that most of
Swarthmore students "haven't been
made to feel a part of this" and Frank
Yu '97, candidate for the Council on
Educational Policy, urged the SC to
"advertise what you have done [and]
make your accomplishment known."
Putting the "power ofthe SC to work
for groups who right now feel alienated from SC processes," was on
everyone's mind as they spoke to the
small groupof students, said Evelina

Shmukler '97, Outreach Chair Candidate.
The Phoenix figured prominently
in the discussion as the paper asked
the first question, concerning the effectiveness of the recent sit-in and

Campaigning in Sharpies
turned the discussion towards the
publicity and communication surrounding the sit- in. During the session, Yu, who was running for the
Council on Educational Policy, identified The Phoenix as essential to
"better communication" and when
asked about the campaign's strongest mediums and forums, cited The
Phoenix as did Vittorio Agnesi '97,
who ran for the College Planning
Committee and Neena Shenai '9B,
who ran for Curriculum Committee.
The latest improvements in communication with the students at election time received their own criticisms from within the SC. Agnesi

worries that the platforms could be
less than informative if the candidates choose to "exaggerate or distort
reality so as to elicit fear, shock, or
other effects." He continued saying,
"I do believe a large percentage of the
student body tends to not take the
campaigning promises very seriously,
mainly due to the unrealistic promises made by some candidatesand the
fact that much of the voting is done
on an 'I know that person' basis."
Candidates also worried that although SC is actively soliciting informed participation, much of the
voting still rests on name recognition.

in her department had provided part
of the rationale for her offer to house
the course.
Keith believes that since many faculty members did "[appreciate] the
value that the course had for many
students," it could be offered as a
non-credit course through the Deans'
Office. While he "did not hastily say
no" to this option, Posner decided
against it after consulting with colleagues. He felt that "it denigrates the

course for credit, especially considering its heavy workload.
Keith said that "there were
students...who were still looking for
a way to make this [course] happen"
again at the April 19 meeting, perhaps as an interdisciplinary or crosslisted offering or in revised form so
as to fit the parameters ofthe linguistics curriculum. Keith says that she
"wasn'tencouraging to [thestudents]
about these possibilities."
Len Cuello '96 feels that although
"the students (and Dr. Posner) made
a very gracious attempt to compromise, to amend the class and syllabus
in order to meet the needs of the
administration/faculty,...they still
didn't find the solution." Keith feels
that students' viewpoints have been
taken into account. She feels that
there is a "difference between hearing student views and [coming] up
with answers students want."
Posner expects to teach courses
analogous to Wisdom of the Healing
Arts at Bryn Mawr and the UPenn in
the near future.

Discuss Academic Future

SC and Candidates Attempt To Solicit Votes

addressed to the Provost, although
not all, were very positive, and 100
students wrote a petition which was
presented to the CEP. Colin Kong
'96 said that "without a doubt,
Posner's seminar is the best class that
I have taken here at Swarthmore"
because it "has taught me how to
apply academic learning to life scenarios." Kong finds it "interesting
that Swarthmore seems to reject this
paradigm of learning when its mission statement claims to embrace it."
Posner asked, "Why doesn't the
faculty seem to care that the students
are getting so much from this course?"

According to Director of Admissions Susan Untereker, 360 students
have sent in deposits to reserve a
place in the Class of 2000, as of
Thursday, May 2. As the Admissions
Office's goal was to admit a class of
365, Untereker says, "we will definitely exceed the target...we have
granted extensions to about 25-30
kids" who were unable to make the
May 1 deadline for accepting the offer of admission. Due to the large
positive response of admitted students, Untereker doubts that any students on the wait list will be offered
admission.
Untereker indicated thatthe incoming class will be more diverse than
the present freshman class. Her statistics indicate that the Class of 2000
includes twice as many AfricanAmericans, four times as many
Latino/Latina students, and slightly
more Asian-Americans than the class
of 1999. The same number of international students were admitted this

year as last year, the highest number
in Swarthmore's history. "I am particularly excited about the socio-economic and ethnic diversity" of the
class of2000, said Untereker. In terms
of gender balance, Untereker commented that "there are slightly more
women than men, but at this point
there is not a significant difference."
Unterekerbelieves that the unusually large matriculation rate was due
to increased exposure of the College
and the record number of students
who attended the accepted students
weekend. The Admissions Office
hopes to maintain the high level of
interest in Swarthmore by expanding
such activities. Swarthmore held its
first open house for high school juniors last Saturday. According to
Untereker, "just over 200 students
showed up." Including parents and
others who may have accompanied
the students, over 425 people attended
the day's events that includedstudent
and student/faculty discussion panels, workshops on application strategies, and a concert by the a capella
group Sixteen Feet.

The Council on Educational Policy
called upon members of the College
community to engage in discussion
about long-term plans for the academic program. The fruits of this
endeavor are a series of panels, two
of which took place this week.
"The points that come up...will be
used by CEP to inform their planning
agenda for next year and beyond,"
wrote Associate Provost Mark Jacobs
in an e-mail addressed to the entire
campus. "CEP need[s] to hear visions of what the College should be
in the next 10 years."
The first panel, convened Monday
afternoon by ProfessorDon Swearer
of the Religion Department, was entitled "The Future Role of Interdisciplinary Studies in the Curriculum"
and took place in Kirby Lecture Hall.
The panel featured five faculty members: Swearer; Carr Everbach, assistant professor of engineering; Tom
Stephenson, associate professor of
chemistry; Carol Nackenoff, associate professor of political science; and
Richard Schuldenfrei, professor of
philosophy.
Swearer introduced the criteria
needed to distinguish an interdisciplinary program, the impact of faculty leaves, and the amount of time
and energy the faculty could devote
to such a program: "We are concerned about the amount of time we
spend in committees and making reports [and]...our ability to keep all
these balls going at the same time."
Everbach, meanwhile, advocated interdisciplinary studies on the grounds
that "they help the College adapt to
change." He also advocated the use
of concentrations, calling the concentration an unofficial "interdisciplinary minor." Nackenoff spoke of
her experiences as a former chair of
the Women's Studies Program.
Schuldenfrei, who spoke last, warned
against the replacement of specialized knowledge in one particular field
by superficial knowledge in many
fields.
Some of the students who spoke
favored more interdisciplinary programs. Justin Hall '97 related how
he'd been almost unable to find a
professor willing to sponsorhis course
on World Wide Web ethics since it
couldn't be classified within a single
department: "There needs to be a
place withinSwarthmore for innova-

tive, abstract, free-floating courses to

wage their way." Thanh Hoang '97
made a passionate argument for the
creation of an Asian-American Studies program. Sean Barney '9B spoke
of the necessary separation of research and education and the interdisciplinary program as an outlet for
certain creative energies. Kate Atkins
'96 said she believed in conflicts between academic disciplines, but that
there should be "a reasonable way"
for students and faculty members to
deal with those conflicts.
"Departments and concentrations
...are not always necessarily competing," said Lisa Smulyan, associate
professor ofeducation, as the debate
continued. Stephenson seconded her
point to a degree: he told the group
neither to play up tensions between
departments andprograms nor to deny
completely their existence. When
Nackenoff brought up the idea of
joint appointments in both departments and programs, so the interdisciplinary programs could have more
autonomy in hiring and could better
cope with the problems of faculty
leave, Barry Schwartz, professor of
psychology, noted that joint appointments would diminish the flexibility
of concentrations, which he saw as
one of their primary virtues. Theparticipants ended the discussion without reaching a consensus; the panel
will meet again to make its recommendations to the CEP.
The second panel convened Tuesday afternoon in Parrish Parlors.
Seven students all gave introductory
talks on different aspects of the panel' s
title, "Student Visions For the Academic Program of the Future." The
students included SC members Jude
Uzonwanne '9B, Frank Yu '97, Omar
Mencin '96, Giridhar Srinivasan '9B,
Will Nessly '99, Nancy Benson-Nicol
'9B, Sean Barney '9B, and Edgar Lee
98 in addition to CEP memberFrank
Yu' 97. Explaining that several points
of the panel's discussion might overlap with the discussion of the day
before, Srinivasan said, "It proves
that the faculty, the administration,
and the CEP are discussing the same
issues as we are." Nessly, for example, brought up the loss of the
course "Wisdom and the Healing
Arts," calling it and classes like it an
"integral part of a well-roundededucation." Uzonwanne examined the
economic future of Swarthmore stu{Continued on page 2}

Students Make Amends for Tarble Theft
By

Jonathan Seitz

Earlier this semester, two students
were caught by Tarble staff while
attempting to steal food. The students, Alyssa Rayman-Read '99 and
Ahsiya Posner' 98 were given a choice
by Assistant Dean Tedd Goundie,
they would go on probation for the
semester or perform community service in the form of educating the
College community about thefts from
Tarble. Posner chose the community
service option while Rayman-Read
chose to go on probation.
"At the meeting [with Goundie] I
was really shocked that it was being
treated so seriously...lt seemed like
so many people were stealing from
Tarble," said Posner. However, after
considering the issue, she added, "I
realized I shouldn't need a warning....
[The thefts] were breaking the school
code."
In a statement released by the two
students, they detailed the effects of
widespread student food theft on the
College community. Popular food
items such as Ben and Jerry's ice
cream are no longer carried because
they were stolen too often; meal credit
is lower than it otherwise might be as
Tarble attempts to "break even" on
food sales—and losing money to

thievery does not help.
Goundie confirmed these facts,
saying that the Swarthmore dining
services are "at a point where they're
just breaking even." No more increases in meal credit at the Snack
Bar are likely in the near future because "they're stretching as far as
they can stretch," he says.
While Posner and Rayman-Read
both acknowledge that their actions
were wrong and deserving of punishment, they also feel that the administration has made an example of them,
and needs to show more uniformity
in dealing with student thefts. "Situations like this need to be dealt with
more consistently," said Posner.
While Rayman-Read hopes that the
administration is "moving on a path
to not being arbitrary," she feels that
their case was not dealt with entirely

fairly.
"Stealing is wrongand should have
a harsh punishment," she said, but
there was "no precedent, no warning
on the first offense."
Goundie insisted that all complaints
that are referred to the Dean's Office
will be treated consistently, but said
that it is up to the Tarble staff to file
complaints. He believes that the staff
is "going to treat [incidences of theft]
more uniformly in terms of sending

them on to the Dean's Office."
Students who are found guilty by
the Dean's Office will most likely be
put on probation, according to
Goundie. A student on probation is
subject to suspension if he or she
violates other College rules. Furthermore, being put on probation constitutes "achange in the student's status
at the College" said Goundie, which
means parents will be notified.
Rayman-Read and Posner said that
inconsistencies in the way thatTarble
staff handles infractions is a further
problem. Students know that certain
"more relaxed or friendly register
workers" allow them to take more
food than their credit allows, they
said.
Another problem they cited was
that a given checker "may allow their
'favorite' customers to take more
food." Rayman-Read and Posner hope
that these problems will be addressed
by the administration of Tarble.
Posner, Rayman-Read and
Goundie all said that they hope the
public attention given to this instance
of theft will discourage others from
committing the same crime. The student body needs to know that "just
taking something hereand there adds
up and affects the whole community," said Goundie.

College Dems and Conservatives Debate
The Nation's Public Schools in Trouble: Are Vouchers the Answer?
By

Fred Bush

College Democrats and

the

Swarthmore Conservative Union
(SCU) faced off in a debate yesterday
evening, focusing on the value of
monetary vouchers enabling students
to attend the public, private, or parochial school of their choice. The
voucher system, conceived by University of Chicago economist Milton
Friedman, is in place in Minnesota
and Milwaukee, and has been the
subject of much debate on the national level.
The debatefeatured three speakers
for both sides, each of whom spoke
for six minutes.Taking the affirmative position that the government
should sponsor school vouchers, SCU
began the debate with an assault upon
the current educational system.
Damon Taaffe '99 led off with a
thundering array of statistics that
showed a decline in student SAT
scores, and cited evidence that most
high-school students didn't know in
which decade the civil war tookplace.
He believed that, after the failure of
various attempts at school reform,
only a free market approach to education could improve schools.
The conservatives developed this
theme over the course of the debate.
Justin Herring '97 noted that while
schools have tried smaller classes
and "new-agey things like adding

more computers to the classroom,"
nothing has worked. "Operating
within the structure of the public
school system is impossible," Herring said, claiming that the teachers'
unions and other groups were
outspending the voucher advocates
in propaganda by a factor of 10-1.
The College Democrats claimed
that a voucher system woulddiscriminate against the poor. Ben Fritz '99
claimed that the school system was
not something that could be modeled
as a free market. He said that no
private school has ever succeeded in
turning a profit, a necessary characteristic in a free market, so therewould
be no incentive for such schools to
open.
In addition, he cited research that
showed that when given the choice,
some parents picked schools on the
basis of factors other than academic
quality. In particular, poor parents
chose schools on the basis of proximity to their house and to a day-care

facilities.
SCU derided this argument, which
they felt degraded the poor and implied that the poor were stupid. "We
hold that poor parents can make just
as good a choice as wealthy ones,"
said Mike Scott '97, in his closing
speech for the Conservative Union.
The College Democrats also attacked the vouchers proposal by
claiming that it wouldresult in more

segregation. Vouchers exacerbated
this "hierarchy" of schools, claimed
Phil Spector '97. Citingevidence from
Minnesota, he showed that AfricanAmericans went to schools that were
predominantly African-American,
whites wentto largely white schools,
and Latinos went to mostly Latino
schools.
In response, SCU's Mike Scott
claimed that the current system was
already segregated. Students who live
in ethnically-segregated areas of one
already go to segregated chools.

Vouchers, said Scott, would allow
students in such areas to attend more

diverse schools elsewhere.
Ending the debate, College Democrat Tara Zahra '9B pleaded that we
not "sacrifice schools to the free market." She argued that under the
voucher system, poorer parents would
make choices for schools based on
"short-term goals," not long-term
goals such as education. In addition,
self-segregation of students and
"white flight" would result in more
racially-homogeneous schools.
A short question-and-answer session followed the debate, and was
marked by lively discussion. No winner was declared in the debate, and
both sides displayed good sportsmanship throughout. Though the promised refreshments failed to materialize, spectators left the event pleased
and, perhaps, enlightened.

Student Representation to Increase
By

Erik Hunekk

Next year, students will be able to
participate in College decision-making processes to a much greater extent. Many College committees will
have a greater proportion of student
representatives than in the past.
Student Council proposed an increase to 25 percent student representation, but application of this ideal
has varied according to the size of the
committees and the balance of constituencies represented within them.
Four of the twenty members of the
College Budget Committee will be
students, as opposed to the current
two out ofeighteen. The CollegePlanning Committee will comprise
twenty-one members, four of whom
will be students. Originally, there
were supposed to be five studentCPC
members, but the Committee on Faculty Procedures did not want theCPC
to become "unnecessarily large," according to Nancy Benson-Nicol '9B,
SC co-coordinator. The Council on
Educational Policy will add one student representative, bringing its total
membership to eleven. The Curriculum Committee will have two stu-

dentrepresentatives out of eight total
members, and the Foreign Study
Committee, which used to have no
student members, will now have onequarter of its twelve positions filled

by students. The Admissions and
Scholarships Committee will grow
in size from twelve to fourteen members, as the total number of student
representatives increasesfrom two to

four.
This increase in student representation results from a meeting among
members of Student Council, President Al Bloom and Provost Jennie
Keith on April 1. They collaborated
in developing a proposal which
Bloom and Keith presented to the
CFP. Bloom described the proposal
as the result of "an effort to increase
student voices on committees and
enhance communication between
committees and the student body."
Benson-Nicol said, "The committees
StudentCouncil was most concerned
with were 'important' policy-making committees that suffered from
substantially limited student representation, such as the College Budget
Committee and College Planning
Committee, in which only two out of

members were students."

There will also be no studentrepresentatives on the Honorary Degree
Committee, since Srinivasan notes
that Bloom "thought it was a matter
of principle that the faculty felt that
they should be the only ones who
award degrees." Benson-Nicol also
remarked that "senior class officers
may now act as liaisons to the committee in order to make recommen-

dations."
Giridhar Srinivasan '9B, SC member and CPC representative, noted
that since the Committee on Academic Requirements (CAR) "looks a
lot at individual students' transcripts,
we agreed that it would not be fair to
have other students" serve as repre-

sentatives.
Benson-Nicol said, "StudentCouncil will act aggressively in the fall to
recruit students for these committees." She notes that a number of
students have already expressed interest in filling the newly-created positions. SC will, for the first time,
familiarize new students during Orientation with the purposes of student
government and opportunities to
serve on committees.

BC Approves Enhanced
Shuttle Funding
The College Budget Committee has
approved extra funding which would
allow the shuttle bus to run every 15
minutes instead ofevery 30 minutes,
according to Larry Schall, associate
vice president for facilities and services.
Schall notes that a second, smaller
van will be purchased to provide this
enhanced service. "The Garnet Patrol and Safewalk programs both continue but in a revised format," Schall
said.

Williams Talks on Affirmative Action
By

Aarti

Iyer

Michael Williams, a black conservative lawyer from Texas, spoke at
LP AC on Monday night at the invitation of the Swarthmore Conservative
Union. He spokeabout race and affirmative action, stating that it is a program that needs to be either eliminated or reformed. He believes that
preference should no longer be given
based on race and ethnicity.
Williams served in the Bush administration as the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department ofEducation. In December
1990, he was responsible for the decision which stipulated that federally
funded colleges could not legally set
aside scholarships on the basis of
race.
Williamssaid that race matters less
and less in our society, and that the
individual is getting to be more important. He cited three reasons for
race's declining significance: first,
the courts are redefining the way in
which individuals should be treated.
Second, there is now morerespect for
the primacy of the individual in our
society. The marketplace strives to
meet theindividual' s particular needs
and desires. According to Williams,
this development is not consistent
with the notion of group identity.
Third, in an informationand knowledge based economy, one's racial
and ethnic identity is simply not significant. With the information technology that is available, we do not
come into direct contact with many
people we communicate with, because we use the telephone, email,
the Internet, and other such technological innovations. We do not know
that the people we deal with are of a
particular race or ethnicity. The equity distinctions are not racial, but
generational, since younger people
are more comfortable with the new

technology.
Williams used demographic statistics to prove that race is less significant now than it has been in the past:
for instance, the black middle-class
is growing in number, a part of the
African-American community is becoming wealthier, and the number of

black-owned industries has increased.
Williams argued that blacks are decreasing the general economic dis-

parity between the races, thus helping to make race an insignificant issue.
Federal law is quiterestrictive when
dealing with public institutions and
theiraffirmative action programs. The
Fourteenth Amendmentprohibits discrimination on the basis of race, and
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 states that distinctions may not
be made based on race, color, national origin, or ethnicity.
Williams statedthat the law places
"extreme limitations under which
federally-funded [academic] institutions can make distinctions among
students on the basis of race." Only
when the institution proves that its
affirmative action program is directly
remedying present effects of past discrimination and racism may it continue with the program. This is extremely hard to prove, according to
Williams, especially as we move further away from the era of legalized
discrimination and segregation.
Williams then suggssted an alternative form ofaffirmativeaction: one
not based on race, but on socio-economic class. "We can [improve the
lives ofpersons of color] using other
variables than race," he explained.
Instead of making distinctions based
on a person's race, preference would
be given to single-parent families, or
to those who did not have the opportunity to attend good schools with
plenty of resources.
Although these "proxies"—Williams' term for these other variables
would still make distinctions between
students, they are "less objectionable," as there is nothing legally
wrong with them. The general public
is also more likely to accept this proxies policy, according to Williams,
because it would not target a particular race, and every person who needs
help would have a fair chance at getting it.
Williams also discussed the issue
of diversity on college campuses and
in the classroom. He argued that what
is actually desired is intellectual diversity, which is not necessarily the
same thing as racial and ethnic diversity. "What I think is not determined
by my race, though it may be affected
by it," he said.
Williams thus argued that a
college's racial diversity does not

Debaters Flock to Swat
By Tony

Sturm

Wondering about those nicely
dressed chaps wandering around last
weekend? They were on a diplomatic
mission from schools all over the
United States: they were participating in the National American Parliamentary Debate Association debate
tournament hosted by Swarthmore's
Amos J. Peaslee Debate Society.
Swarthmore's debate team hosted
the tournament this year. Swarthmore
teams had captured the national title
for the past two years, and on the
basis of that strong tradition decided
that it would be a friendly gesture to
host this year's event. In order to
avoid any conflict of interest,
Swarthmore did not field a team.
Debate teams came from all over
the country to participate in the competition, with schools from Bates to
Stanford competing. However, the
winners had to travel less than half an
hour to get here, as the University of
Pennsylvania A Team won the championship against a team from
Stanford.
The UPenn team, consisting of debaters Peter Stris and Liz Rogers,
beat Stanford in what was called "a
weird round," by the event's organiz-

ers.
Out of the 40 schools that participate actively in the Parliamentary
Debate Association, 35 schools sent
representatives, and a total of65 twoperson teams graced the Swarthmore
campus with their presence.
In addition to all of the current
debaters, several Swarthmore alumni
came to help out with the tournament
and judge the competitions. Included
in the list of alumni were former
national champions Neil Potischman
'95, Jeremy Mallory '95, and David
Carney '94.
The tournament went off without a
hitch due largely to Phil Spector '97
and Mike Scott '97, who were the
directors and organizers of the competition. "Wehad been planning most
of the semester," said Spector. Most
members of the Swat debate team
helped out in the festivities.
Judging from the visiting teams'
reactions, it seemed that all were impressed by Swarthmore's ability to
play host. Said Spector of the tournament, "It was a roaring success. Last
year's nationals [at Johns Hopkins]
was extremely successful, and everyone had a really good time here and
was saying that it was as good or even
better than last year's."

determineits intellectual diversity. It
also does not mean that a racially
homogeneous college community is
segregated or discriminatory. It is
wrong to have institutions of only
one color only when the government
says it has to be that way. One cannot
assume that there is racism and discrimination present in every situa-

tion, Williams explained.
During the question and answer
session that followed, one student
wondered exactly what constituted
"present effects of past discrimination." Should we consider the fact
that, in general, blacks have lived in
worse conditions than whites? Williams responded that there are other
social and economic factors that have
influenced the standard of living of
the black race. For instance, he asked
whether the high number of singleparent families among blacks was
due to past discrimination, or to social problems within that society.
Other students had strong objections as well. One woman felt that it
was unfair that the state alone should
be allowed to decide which actions
are to be considered discriminatory.
Another was concerned about the
seeming rigidity of the law and the
interpretation of the Constitution.
Vincent Jones '9B said that Williams "didn't seem to provide a firm
base for some of his claims...for instance, that race is becoming less
important. Given the demographic
facts...that whites are going to be
constituting a minority, the increased
immigration ofLatinos, and Proposition 187, more conflicts are likely."
Damon Taaffe '99, a member of
theSwarthmore Conservative Union,
said that he "liked the lecture. [Williams'] ideas were very interestin ...I
agree with them, and I liked that he
didn't merely condemn affirmative
action, but proposed alternativesOne weakness would be his lack of
acknowledgment about the moral
implications of the various
policies...but he was not out to emphasize what is moral, butrather what
is legal, practical, and consistent."
The lecture was co-sponsored by
the Swarthmore Conservative Union,
the President's Fund, the Forum for
Free Speech, SASS, College Republicans, and the Young America Foundation.

dents and the value of a traditional
liberal arts education in today's technologically advanced economy.
This last question provoked a good
deal of discussion of the quality of a
Swarthmore education. "Quality standards could be raised at this institution," startedBarney, whileLee spoke
of the many academic pressures on
students. As the discussion heatedup,
Uzonwanne reminded the group,
"We're not saying the traditional
Swarthmore curriculum should be
thrown out the window," and
Elisabeth Swim '99 added, "We don't
have to lose the rigor."
There will be four more panels.
Philip Weinstein, professor of English literature, will lead today' s panel,
"Support for the Teacher-Scholar of
the Future," from 12:30 to 2:00 p.m.
The three panels to be held next week
are "Education for an Intercultural
World," on Monday, May 6, from 3 to
5 p.m.; "Social Responsibility for the
Future," on Tuesday, May 7, from 1
to 3 p.m., and "Visions of Academic
Excellence in theFuture," on Wednesday, May 8, from 1 to 3 p.m. The first
will be convened by Braulio Mufioz,
professor of sociology, the second by
Meta Mendel-Reyes, assistant professor of political science, and the
third by Richard Valelly, associate
professor of political science. All panels will meet in Kirby Lecture Hall.

Student Council: Lookin Good.
’

We applaud Student Council’s work this semester to expand its mandate in
the student body. While many students believe the March sit-in at the Board
of Managers meeting was an excessively strong response to the issue at hand,
it did galvanize student interest in SC. This week’s elections gave us hope that
a growing number of students will pay attention to what SC does, and that SC
will come to represent the needs and concerns of a broader, more diverse
segment of the student body.
A voting station in the Sharpies lobby offered the opportunity to vote to
many students who otherwise might have ignored the elections. And a
candidates’ forum held Wednesday night in Sharpies gave the few students
who showed up a chance to ask the questions that mattered to them, so they
didn’t have to make their electoral choices solely on the basis of the issues
candidates addressed in their platforms and signs.
Speaking of signs, we were impressed by some candidates’ attempts to give
thoughtful, in-depth explanations of their views. We were also disturbed by
the inane or needlessly alarmist posters with which other students covered
virtually every building on campus. It’s astonishing that some candidates
believed they could win votes by promising free drinks or by finding
numerous words that rhymed with their names.
Proof that students cared about the candidates’ views, despite the fact that
some candidates expressed no real views, came when a student with strong,
clear-cut political concerns lost the race for Curriculum Committee. Neena
Shenai ’9B was running unopposed; while it surely hurts when more people
abstain than vote for you, the result demonstrates why the “abstain” option on
the ballot is so important. If only one person runs for a seat, students should
still have another choice—the choice to hold a new election.
Werecommend the new election be held in the fall. There justisn’t time for
students to decide to seek the seat, for candidates to make their opinions
known to the voters, and for balloting to take place, before everyone goes
home for the summer. Also, an election at the beginning of the school year will
help get first-year students interested in SC right away.
Of course, therewon’t be a secondround ofelections every year, so Council
should create a regular mechanism for involving first-years in student government. Perhaps the entering class could elect its own SC representative each
September. While new students probably won’t know each other or the
campus well enough to conduct truly meaningful campaigns, they will have
more reason to pay attention to student government and to think about the
many opportunities Swarthmore students have to participate in their community if given the chance to elect their own representative right from the start.
We urge all students who are not graduating to think about joining a Student
Council, student-faculty-administration, or Board of Managers committee
when they return to campus in the fall. In particular, those who ran forSC and
lost should think seriously about seeking committee appointments next
year—just because you lost an election, in some cases by only a few votes,
does not mean you have nothing to add to the debate on this campus.

Making multiculturalism meaningful.
The College’s recent series of panel discussions on the future of academics
here at Swarthmore have brought students and faculty and administration
together for an interesting, sometimes highly contentious, discussion. Certain
issues keep coming up in these lectures, such as the fate of Wisdom and the
Healing Arts. More importantly, however, the panel discussions have served
to shed light on a glaring hole in the College’s curriculum.
We speak here ofthe lack of courses in such areas as Latino Studies, Gay,
Lesbian, and Bisexual Studies, and Asian-American Studies. There are few
courses currently being taught in the above areas, and certainly nothing to
compare to the well-organized, cross-disciplinary Women’s Studies or Black
Studies concentrations. At panel discussions, students of various backgrounds have been vocal in their criticism of the College.
The school is doing the student body a disservice by not representing

members of certain ethnic groups sufficiently in the curriculum. While an
Asian Studies already exists, and there are plans for a Latin American Studies
concentration, neither of them adequately addresses issues relating to those
people of Asian or Latino descent who already are here in the U.S. These
people are an important part ofAmerican history, and their story is not getting
told.
There are a number of options available to the College to deal with this
problem. Simplest wouldbe simply to add courses within therubric of history,
with a slant toward Asian-Americans or Latinos. However, this would be
more window dressing than a deep, organized investigation of the role these
groups have played in American society.
The ultimate answer, we feel, is to establish a concentration in these areas
similar to the already-existing concentrations in other ethnic studies. However, we recognize that it will take time to hire the staff and go through the
necessary procedures to establish a new concentration.
Until then, we hope the College will acknowledge this gap in its teaching.
Instead of evading the issue, the school should encourage present faculty
members to teach more courses in these areas: make a good start, at least.

Have a great summer.
This is the last issue of The Phoenix of the semester. We will not publish
again until September. Good luck with finals and take advantage of the
summer to get some rest and relaxation, or to make some extra cash if you can,
or do an internship or two. In any case, enjoy the next few months. See you
in September.

Editors-in-Chief and Publisher for Fall 1996
After a week of voting and campaigning, The Phoenix has elected two
editors-in-chief and a publisher. Mandara Meyers ’99 and Erik Huneke ’97
were voted co-editors-in-chief and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl ’9B was elected
publisher. All students who contributed to The Phoenix in some capacity at
least three times during the semester were eligible to vote. Thanks to all who
participated in the election. Julie Falk, former co-editor-in-chief, will serve
as ChairofForeign Correspondents while on sabbatical in Scotland next year.

Conservatives and
Liberals Need to
Listen to Each Other
By Wendy Lawrence

Today

we are going to discuss
the "Damon dilemma." You
see, a lot ofSwatties associate
the Damon Taaffe, renowned writer
for Common Sense, with evil. Why?
Because of his political views. Because he is (and this next word must
be said very quietly) c-o-n-s-e-r-v-a-t-i-v-e. Now I happen to know Damon,
and think that he is far from evil, and
even somewhat smart. In fact, if Dole
is still looking for a running mate,
Damon just might be the answer. But
it is true, however, that I don'tagree
with many of the things that he says.
Anything he says, really. And that is
the gist of the Damon dilemma.Too
often we associate different views
with ignorance, which makes it easy
to ignore the other side of the issue.
And this is what I mean by the
Damon dilemma.

Politics at Swarthmore
So let's look at the political views
of the average Joe Shmoe Swattie.
Pretty dang liberal is a good guess.
But we do have all sides of the spectrum represented. I would be surprised if Karl Marx, Lyndon
Laßouche, Pat Buchanan, and Richard Nixon couldn't all find a followinghere. The pink and blue chalkings,
the angry posters, the letter-writing
campaigns that stop you as you walk

But it is definitely not enough to
just be politically aware. For a campus that claims to embrace openmindedness as much as this one, we
must be sure to be open-minded about
ourselves. For a community that
praises diversity as much as Swarthmore, we must be certain that intellectual diversity is recognized not
only for the interesting character it
lends our school, but for the value of
the actual arguments.
And this leads us right back to the
Damon dilemma, the idea that listening to the other side and debating the
issues isn't happening at the familiar,
conversational level. Now is this a
problem peculiar to S warthmore?No.
I certainly do not mean to imply that
at all. But it is a problem that one
notices more at a place like Swarthmore. A place where people do have
strong political views, where people
are unafraid to express their views—whatever they might be.

The Unabomber
Considerthe Unabomber. Well, not
the Unabomber himself, but the posters regarding said criminal that were
seen around here. In my opinion, they
were pretty funny. But my opinion
matters little. What matters is the
content of the posters. Questioning
the guilt of Theodore Kaczynski as
the Unabomber, the posters mocked
an earlier Swattie campaign with the
rallying cry of "Free Mumia," which
questioned the authorities about the
true story of a man alleged to have
killed a Philadelphia police officer.

14-Meal Plan Experiment Will Be Model for Change
New Meal Plan is a Deal for Those Who Routinely Skip More Than Six Meals Each Week

College's meal plan will have
a new option of a 14-mealsper-week meal plan available beginning next semester. The 14meals can
be used for any combinations ofmeals

Sharpies, Kohlberg, or Tarble. The
14 meal plan will be available to all
but first-year students, and will cost
the same as the 20-meal plan.
The long version begins with some

the same amount as the existing meal
plan. However, students on the 14meal plan will also have access to a

The current changes will be a model

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Black studies addresses more than colonialism.
To the editor:
I felt the need to briefly respond to comments by Vincent Jones '9B
regarding course offerings on the "African and African-American experience" in the recent Phoenix article, "Does Swat Have an Image Problem?"
Jones states that black studies classes at Swarthmore "deal primarily with
issues of colonialism, slavery, imperialism, and civil rights." For the record,
I offer courses on religion in bothAfrica and America withina framework that
historicizes black experience while emphasizing questions of Old WorldNew World cultural continuity. While contemporary in focus, the focus in
these courses also touches on the traditional religious milieu of "ancient"
African civilizations in Nigeria, Benin, and Ghana.

and variety of food offered at Sharpies. The key point is to strike a balance between student savings and
Sharpies business solvency. As it is,
the new plan is already in line with
what is offered by other colleges of

Swarthmore's size with alternative
meal plan options.
The costs for 20 meals per week
are not directly related to the number
of meals served in the week. There
are many fixed costs associated with
serving meals at Tarble and Sharpies,
that must be paid regardless of how
•

many students eat. The fixed costs
include such items as building maintenance and employee salaries. If a
meal costs, say, $5, $3 of that may go
to fixed costs while only $2 pays for
food—so savings in the meal plan
won't be directly proportional to the
number of meals eliminated.
Additionally, Sharpies' budget already takes into account that some
students skip meals. The students
most likely to partake in the alternative meal plan will be those who
already skip meals, meaning thatthem
being on the 14 meal plan does not
save the school any money than if
they remained on the 20 meal plan.
Why is the debit card being used,
rather than an optional meal plan that
actually costs less than the existing
meal plan? There are numerous reasons. One of them is that changing
the meal plan, such that a reduced
meal plan actually costs less than the
existing meal plan, would complicate financial aid allocations. The

question arises for those who are on
financial aid: if the option is available for them to pay less tuition by
participating in thereduced meal plan,
why should it not be required? Having more than one tuition figure interferes withfinancial aid procedures;
as the program is in its infancy, it is
easier now to use a debit system than
a truly cheaper meal plan.
It is important to note that the new
meal plan is only useful for those
students who routinely skip 6 (or
more) meals each week. If you don't
use all of your meal credit but you do
occasionally eat more than 14 meals
per week, the 14 meal plan is probably not a good deal for you.
There will be a mailing in the early
summer to all returning students regarding the new meal plan. In this
mailing, students will be allowed to
pick their meal plan option for the
following year. It is very important
that your selection of meal plan be
returned promptly so that the necessary programming is done prior to
your return in the fall. There will be a
late penalty for people who respond
after the deadline; those who do not
respond will automatically be placed
on the existing 20 meal plan. Once
the semester begins, no changes in
the meal plan will be allowed.
New card-checking technology is
required for the new meal plan. The
new equipment has been purchased
and will be on line sometime in late
May or early June, ready to be used
next semester.

Penner corrects editing

of last week's letter.

To the editor:
When you printed my letter last weekyou edited out words that changed the
meaning of the letter. The debate on the Rosenberg case was presented in an
unbiased forum where opinions on both sides could be heard. The second
paragraph originally read: "That The Phoenix did not cover this event is as
hard to believe as the verdict of the case itself is for many."
Your cut of those last words from the letter makes it seem as though those
presenting and sponsoring the debate had a singular position on the case and
we do not know that that is true. While I think that the majority of people today
would agree that the death sentence was not justified, we do not know how all
the people feel about the verdict itself.
Please make this correction. I think thatotherwise you leave people with the
wrong impression and have changed the meaning and character of the letter.
Thank you.

failure of sorts, a total loss of function, for your columnist to admit that
he had problems and start dropping
classes or giving up extracurricular
commitments, and while that attitude
is in itself pathological (fear of failure taken to an extreme), that pathology is hardly uncommon here.
This is a plea, therefore, for understanding and sympathy for the socially "out"—for there is such a category, even here. The College explicitly recruits mostly top-flighthigh
school students, and recruits them in
a way that selects neurotic intellectuals; being "in love with ideas", as one
slogan has it, is often a sign of a lessthan-well-rounded personality. Consequently, our student body inevitably has a high proportion of, let's be
frank, social misfits, kids whose academic pursuits in high school forestalled developing a social sphere.
Some, clearly, overcome those limitations, and some remain wallflowers in the social dance, and your columnist urges active awareness and
support for the latter category. More
understanding of our common burdens might take the edge off that
sense ofSwat as a mental ward. Your
columnist's personal experience has
taught him that neurotic intellectualism in itself is not sufficient basis for
social interaction. There are dangers
inherent in the Swat way of life, and
inpreserving socialbarriers that leave
some out in the cold.

the negatives of life here. Your col-

overhear students remarking on how
they would miss the place during the

at Swarthmore. A happier outlook

Affirmative Action: Reward Merit, Not Race
By

Neena Shenai

Intel ectual

diversity, not racial diversity" comprises the view of
Michael Williams on affirmative
action, or as he called it, "preference." He stated that he would like to
see these preferences based on socioeconomic factors rather than on race
or ethnicity. This is a viable solution
for rethinking the way in which preferences are given in this country. To
move away from race-based affirmative action, we enact policies of nonrace-based preferences.
Mr. Williams was instrumental in
creating the law which prohibits federally funded institutions from granting race-based scholarships. He used
the example of a Hispanic man, Mr.
Podberesky, a student at the University of Maryland, who applied for a
scholarship that was traditionally reserved for African-American students. The school's excuse for denying him the scholarship was that a)
African-American studentshad lower
test scores and thusneeded themoney,
b) the University of Maryland used
the scholarship to improve its bad
standing among African-Americans,
and c) the scholarship led black students to feel more comfortable on
campus.
In the 1991 case Podberesky vs.
Kirwan, Mr. Podberesky was given
the scholarship because the circuit
court deemed the school's criteria
exclusionary. This is an example of
why Mr. Williams's 1990 law was,
Shenai '9B is a Latin major.

and continues to be, successful. Scholarships should be merit-based; race
empowerment should not be a criterion. After all, by reserving scholarships for a certain group of people,
we are not ensuring the success of
this group. Those people who are
motivated, regardless ofrace, should
be given a chance for advancement.
The next question Mr. Williams
addressed dealt with the misconception that his law would reduce the
possibility of minority students going to college. He stated that a revised
system of preferences would in turn
be given on the basis of income, number of parents in the household, quality of the school, and the quantity and
quality of learning tools available to
students in schools. The political and
practical benefit for these new "proxies" is that a legal standard is being
met and everyone is able to compete
for the benefits. The counterargument
might state that certain ethnic groups
are marginalized through this process. Why? Have these same people
who are applying for benefits been
directly the targets of discrimination?
Probably not. The law stipulates that
only those individuals who havebeen
wronged in the past have recourse.
As Mr. Williams stated "Jim Crow
and all the slaves who should have
benefited from affirmative action are
already dead." Thus, everyone should
be competing on the same level.
With his progressive ideas, Mr.
Williams moved to the topic of individual choice. He presented the
Internet as the prime example of why
race should no longer be an issue,

observing that when we sit at our
computers, we do not know whether
with our correspondents are black,
white, blue, green, yellow, etc. He
said that our current and future preferences will be based on our perception of performance, not ethnicity.
Our basis for affirmative action
should therefore be modified to fit
the changing times.
In closing, upon being asked by a
member of the audience how he saw
himself as a black conservative,
Michael Williams responded that he
is a "conservative because [he is]
black, not in spite of it"and that "race
is just a currency in the trade." Using
an example, he mentioned his 100member law firm which has only
three African-American lawyers, asserting that the reason for this was
that only fifteen African-Americans
had applied for a position. In other
words, we cannot look at the absence
of minorities as an example of discrimination. His conservative views
show how differences in background,
not necessarily differences in race,
breed intellectual diversity.
We should view diversity as including people of varying ideas, not
solely differences in ethnicity. With
new technology facilitating increased
integration between cultures, our
world is too much of a global community to have race preside over preferences. Thus, considering other factors will allow greater integration in
our society. Mr. Williamstegan this
crusade in colleges when he proposed
his law regarding race-based scholarships.

I

votedthis week in StudentCouncil elections for the first time. I
voted for the tall, skinny, Mexican guy. He was running for the College Planning Committee. His name
does not matter. All that matters is
that he is tall and skinny, and so am I.
I stumbled upon the above reasoning upon seeing the signs for a woman
who was running for the same position. Her name is not important, either. She reminded me of that, as she
wanted people to vote for her "for a
woman's voice on the council."
So I guess that all that is important
about her is that she is a woman.
What she chooses to be, think, or do
is not important. The non-moral characteristic, sex, is important here, according to this woman, anyway. Oh,
and race and ethnicity are important
to her, also. She wanted equal representation of certain groups of people
on the tenured faculty. Other characteristics of the people are not really
important. In fact, all individuals are
representatives of their sex, race, and
ethnicity.
This is what I have learned at
Swarthmore. I took this lesson to
heart, and voted for the tall guy. I

mean, he must represent me: we are
both tall and skinny. That woman
who ran represents all women and
their interests. Of course, this type of
thinking pits tall people against short,
women against men, and all groups
against one another. My interests are
aligned with other people like me, i.e.
white, tall, skinny men.
See, I used to be naive. I used to
think that what people chose to be is
important—that morality applies in
therealm of what people have control
over. But now I realize that at Swarthmore, who I choose to be is not important. I am a representative of my
sex, race, ethnicity, height, etc. And
hence, so are the people who run in
student politics.
With my enlightenment comes a
new world view. My mission in life is
to advance the good ofmy tribe. Don' t
ask me what that means; after all my
tribe has its own way ofcommunicating. You wouldn't understand. That
tall skinny guy represents an advance
for the good of the group, the group
of tall skinny men—no matter what
he thinks on issues, no matter his
integrity. He is part of my tribe, and
hence I feel a bond with him. He
speaks for me. His success is my
success. Food in his stomach is food
in mine.
I now understand the reaction to

the OJ Simpson verdict. (I believe he
did murder two people.) If what is
important about people is their race,
and not what they choose to be, well,
everything makes sense. OJ's acquittal symbolizes a great step forward
for the tribe of black people everywhere. Some black people feel that
OJ, as a black man, represents them.
They feel thattheir sharedracial background does more to unite them than
their different actions—murder vs.
no murder—does to divide them.
Gosh, it's so easy now. I understand things more clearly than ever
before. I do not need to judgepeople
by what they choose to be. I can fit
them into little categories of race,
class, gender, and ethnicity. No need
to call each other by first names anymore. I can greet people according to
their group: "Hey comrade tall man....
Howdy, my Asian endomorph
friend." You get the picture. Such a
diverse student body we have here.
Oh, and faculty, too.
All this time, I thought I was appreciated for who I chose to be. Gosh,
what a relief. Hello Swarthmore, I am
a tall, skinny, white man and really
that's all you have to know about me.
We of this type are interchangeable.
Just keep the quota of tall skinny
white men full. Print the demographics everywhere and all will be well.

Swarthmore History

By Elizabeth Weber

these pictures look like Swarthmore to you? All of the buildings in
these pictures from the Friends' Historical Library used to stand on campus. All
have been razed—three to make room for
buildings more familiar to us, and the fourth
after an arsonist set a fire which all but destroyed it.
Other college buildings are also gone.
Members of the classes of '96, '97, and '9B
watched a wrecking ball demolish Parrish
Annex to make room for Kohlberg Hall a year
and a half ago. Mary Lyon buildings 2 and 3
were demolished after a 1982 fire. Finally,
the Temple of the Book and Key Society,
home of Swarthmore's own secret society,
was razed in 1966, a decade after the Society
ceased selecting new members.

By Christopher DiLeo

When

I first began looking at Swat
back in my junior year of high
school, Kohlberg Hall was no
more than a large quantity of levelled
ground. When I finally decided to come to
here, there was a hulking metal frame and a
pile of dirt. Now that I'm on the verge of
completing my first year, Kohlberg is a
rather nice building...but there's still that
pile of dirt. So, one of the first things I
learned here at Swarthmore was symbolic
interpretation. The completion ofKohlberg
will represent me as I grow and establish
myself here at Swarthmore College. As for
the pile of dirt, well, I haven't figured that
out yet. Guess that's why I'm spending
three more years here.
It seems appropriate to reflect on my first
year and, well, to start with the first week.
All of us first-years spent it at Camp Swat.
One week with no classes, just hanging out
and going to parties and meeting people,
etc. And I was thinking, "Great, if this is
college, I'm going to do justfine." But then
I had to meet with my faculty advisor and
start talking about which classes I wanted
to take. Needless to say, when things began
on Monday morning, it was quite a reality

check. I woke up and went into my 8:30

class and sat with my new pens and notebook and neat clothes and thought, "Hell, I
am in college now! I can handle this!" As
the semester went on, however, my attitude
changed. Perhaps my first real lesson about
college was that I should try to avoid 8:30
classes as much as possible.
One of the most important factors in
adjusting to college life was dorm life.
Where else can you live communally with
25 other people who never sleep, work a lot,
play really great music and seem to have at
least one thing in common with you? And
RAs are great people for heading all of the
important functions of a hall, such as taking
pizza orders, picking teams for hall soccer,
and restocking the hall medicine kit! Seriously though, RAs are excellent people and
definitely add to the life of the hall.
Seeing how much has happened this year,
I'm going to try another tactic. I am going to
briefly give a stream of consciousness account ofmy good memories (see, I am truly
becoming a Swattie!): Professor
Shimamoto's welcomeaddress...Bob Gross'
welcome address ("No matter what you do
or say to me I am still a worthwhile

person")...the first dance in front of
Sharpies...the first meal at Sharpies...the
first real party.. .my first Swat crush.. .Paces
(now open Sunday through Wednesday

nights)., when the Sharpies food began
repeating...Paces (on those other nights)...
the Dave Matthews concert...walks in the
Cram as the leaves began to turn colors... the
fall formal...going home to my "friends" for
winter break...SNOW!!...taking walks in
the Cram in the snow...the Screw your
Roommate dance...Cappucino in the
Kohlberg espresso bar... biology class field
trip to Longwood Gardens... Prospective
Students' Weekend (I managed to pack five
of them into my room)...Parents' Weekend...the Spring Formal...writing articles
like this for the Phoenix..
So those are a few of the outstanding
memories from my freshman year. It was
hard to keep touch with all the friends I said
I would never lose touch with, but I also
know now that the ones I did correspond
with are truly my friends. Perhaps more
importantly, I also made a whole bunch of
new friends here from all over this crazy
.

world of ours.
I guess what stands out most looking
back at this year is that I can now see why
Swat alumni say the hardest thing about
Swat isn't doing the work, but rather leaving after the end of four years...
Have a good and safe summer and good
luck to all graduating seniors heading off
into the real world!

Off-Campus Movie Review

Movie Reviewers' Reunion...and This Weekend's Movies
By

Jonathan Evans, Jessica Keith, Carl
Heiberg and Kate Zyla

Q: How many Swat seniors does it take to

write a movie review the last week ofclasses?
A: Four. And we're still having a tough
time with it. You'd think with four procrastination-oriented movie buffs, we'd have seen
this week's films, but they had to go and show
random ones that we either have never felt the
need to see or that aren't out on video. Never
fear. They don't let you out of this place
without teaching you something about how
to write extensively on a subject you know
little about, so we won't let you down.
Kate: I'll begin because, well, I got my
butt in gear first and my name's in the staff
box, so I have that kind of power. This week
the Movie Committee brings us "Army of
Darkness" and last year's "Sabrina," the final
pair of on-campus films for this semester.
"Army ofDarkness" is the third film in the
"Evil Dead" series, a set of campy, comedic
horror movies directed by Sam Raimi and
starring Bruce Campbell. The third film is,
according to Raimi, a remake of "Evil Dead"
as a tribute to the Three Stooges. Hard to go
wrong there. It's also, technically speaking,
the only one of the three "Evil Dead" films
that I haven't seen, so I'll pass on this one.
Carl: All right. Before anything else, I'd
just like to say one thing. Kate and I are far
more amusing and said things far wittier than
Jon or Jessica ever did. The fact that Evans
had a "Quote of the Week" for the Bond
weekend makes me a little sad at the state of

In "Army of Darkness," Ash is transported

combining comprehensive selection,
small venue entertainment, and
bourgeoisie bohemian cafe decor in a
well-lit, user friendly environment, super
bookstores like Borders and Barnes & Noble
have nearly run independent bookstores like
the Booktrader (Fifth and South Streets in
Philly) out of business.
Gone are the days when you had to spend
the larger part of an hour searching through
dusty stacks of foreign books to find the
desired small press poet or academic journal.
To some it may be a welcome step up toward
bibliophilic Utopia—instant access to all desired books inmyriad editions with almost no
wait for ordered books.
The Booktrader, however, is a welcome
throwback to the less self-conscious days of
book buying when searching through reams
oforphan books could yield surprises—books
forgotten about and rediscovered with a notyet-seen jacketand cryptic side margin notes
of a fledgling student, or perhaps genius
writer in the making.
Somewhat obscured by the loud Generation X bauble shops and booming car stereos
of cruisers, the Booktrader has quietly established a niche for itself on the search and seek
shopping experience of South Street. Boasting two floors of used books,records, stationary, and more, a long (or short) duck into this
treasury can be a relief from the noise of the
street.

Fragile skyscrapers of books teetering toward the ceiling line the walls and stuff the
corners of the dustyplace. Although the store
has been keenly organized into sections like
essays, drama, poetry, etc., there are always
books peaking out of unsorted piles waiting
to be discovered and traded. The trading
policy for the Booktrader is fair and often
beneficial to someone looking for some juicy
summer reading. With half a dozen well-read
Shakespeare paperbacks (now replaced with
a hardbound edition), I earned enough credit
for three handsome, hardbound books.
Sheer volume and geographic diversity of
book flow brings the Booktrader nice hard
cover and paperback versions of books students might need for class. Modern Library
edition hardcovers abound, as do some firstpress editions of contemporary authors. The
classics are perhaps the easiest to find due to
thenumberof Philadelphia-area students trading in books for one class for credit.
The requisite artist types in black berets
and jeans decorate theaisles and crowd around
the familiar nice guy at the front desk lending
a literary aura to the Booktrader. On any late
weekday night, bunches of hairy youths with
too much Marx in their heads can be heard
loudly talking back and forth over the steady
stream of business at the front counter. Upstairs, Polish and French can be heard from
people browsing among the foreign language
copies of fiction and poetry.
I sometimes do not find the book I want,
but I always leave with three or four also on
my ever-extending list of books I would like
to read. With the approaching abyss of postgraduation, or summer time for juniors and
underclassmen, a trip to the Booktrader will
restore the pleasure in bookshopping and set
you up for good reading.

Falls"

—

Style

And That's All
By

lan Bricke

Mulholland

Falls" is all about style.
Specifically, it's about fedoras, vintage cars, and cigarettes. And that's
about it. It's like a sleek, streamlinedEdsel: it
looks good, but there's nothing under the
hood. As a detective thriller, it's a crock. As
a romance, it's a dud. As an action picture, it
fizzles. In other words, it's remarkably bad.
The hero is named Hoover (Nick Nolte).
He's a maverick cop in 1950's Los Angeles,
leader of a quartet of semi-vigilante lawmen
who cruise around the valley in their Buick,
looking for mobsters to beat up: His pals are
Coolidge (Chazz Palminteri), Realya (Chris
Penn), and Eddie Hal (Michael Madsen).
Coolidge is seeing a shrink in his spare time,
which sets the stage for innumerable stupid
psychoanalysis jokes. Eddie and Realya
mainly serve to fill up the other two seats in
that Buick (probably a blessing, given the
collective acting talents ofPennand Madsen).
About twenty minutes into the movie, the
boys get a case: the mangled body of a young
woman, identified as Allison Pond (Jennifer
Connelly), has been found pressed into the
dirt at a suburbanconstruction site, a chunk of
radioactive glass embedded in her heel. The
case has special meaning for Hoover: he had
an affair with Allison, abandoning it only
when he realized that he loved his wife
(Melanie Griffith) more. Hoover wasn't
Allison's only lover, though. An amateur
film which arrives in our hero's mail shows
his former squeeze having sex with one General Timms (John Malkovich), head of the
Atomic Energy Commission. With the introduction ofAllison's best friend and clandestine cameraman (Andrew McCarthy, who
should be sent back to the straight-to-video
hell from whence he comes), the plot doesn't
just thicken, it congeals. By "Mulholland
Fall's" astonishingly inept climax, Hoover
and his sidekicks have locked horns with
nuclear radiation, high-caliber machine guns,
a Baldwin (Daniel, appearing as an overbearing FBI agent), and a particularly authoritarian Army commander (Treat Williams).
This is the Hollywood debut of Lee
Tamahori, the New Zealander who made
waves last year with his first film, the fiery
"Once Were Warriors." Tamahori obviously
loves the conventions of film noir: moody
lighting, melodramatic plot twists, guys in
cool hats, cigarette smoke (lots of it). But he
doesn't seem to be able to translate his passion into an even halfway engaging movie.
"MulhollandFalls" has about as much zip
as a flat Pepsi. Scene after scene trudges
through the motions, as Dave Grusin' s wildly
inappropriate score thumps and tinkles and
the dialogue (by Pete Dexter) grows exponentially worse. It's sad, watching a talented
director flounder in this swill.Tamahori works
hard to reinflate this sagging mess, mustering
every tough-guy gangster cliche he can think
of, and the great Haskell Wexler shoots everything in sharp-edged color noir style, but
the final product is D.O.A. Coming on the
heels of last year's brilliant "Devil in a Blue
Dress," "Mulholland Falls" plays like the
film noir that thought it could, but couldn't.
It doesn't help that Nick Nolte's evermultiplying wattles (not to mention his arsenal of grunts) upstage his thoroughly routine
performance every chance they get, or that
the Andrew McCarthy character is a walking
compendium of homophobic cliches. Jennifer Connelly spends most of her time rolling
around naked, and still comes away with
considerably more dignity than most of her
fellow cast members. John Malkovich is a
treat, as usual, as the wily and consumptive
General, but he could (and probably did) play
this character in his sleep. The same goes for
the ever-dependable Chazz Palminteri, who's
due a good role any day now ("Jade,"
"Diabolique," "MulhollandFalls"—can'tthis
guy get a break?). And Melanie Griffith's
still one of the worst actresses in the world
(if s good to know some things never change).
Tamahori actually has the chutzpah to show
her lying on a couch, A Farewell to Arms in
hand. Nice try, but no dice. The hero is a
Hoover, but the movie justplain sucks..

incredible cast (anything with Bogart and
Audrey Hepburn can't be all bad) and (this
might just be a personal thing) the use of the
Edith Piaf song "La Vie En Rose." The original "Sabrina" played some really neat thematic games with dueling love songs. I don't
care if it was John Williams who redid the
score, it shouldn't have been done.
The fact is, without Bogie, Hepburn, and
Holden, the most exciting aspect of the film
is gone. As much as I love Harrison Ford,
even he can't carry the intrigue that was
already resting so tenuously on the shoulders
of the great Bogart. As for Kinnear, sorry, I
can't get past that annoying talk-show-guy
image, and it doesn't matter how good
Ormond may or may not be, no one will ever
replicate the style of Audrey Hepburn, one of
the few reasons I still enjoyed the original
"Sabrina."
Carl: Since Kate and I are here, we're
doing Oats ratings! I' m going with a heaping,
bordering on overflowing, bowl of oats for
"Army of Darkness," and although I didn't
see "Sabrina," I'm a big Harrison Ford fan
and like that Kinnear so I'll toss a half full
bucket of oats at that film.
Kate: "Sabrina" is cute, but generally unimpressive. See the original. A few oats for
an old fashioned love story, but no rave
reviews here. Finally, in order to finish off the
year well, I'm going to give "Army ofDarkness" a big heaping bucket of oats, based
entirely on my seventh grade Halloweenparty
when we watched "Evil Dead II" and loved it.
Jonathan: I think both Kate and Carl can
dump the bucket of oats on their head! They
should go live on a farm, a funny farm since
Carl thinks he's so hilarious.
Jessica: You go, girl!
Carl: Um, whatever. At least we knew
when to quit.
Jonathan: Why don't you say good-bye?
Jessica: Okay. Bye-bye boys...have fun
storming the castle!
Jonathan: Think it'll work?
Jessica: It would take a miracle.
Carl: Miracle, shmiracle. Glad we could
come back for this week'sreview. Good luck
on finals and don't forget to see me in my new
film this summer, "Get Back Into My Dreams:
The Billy Ocean Tribute."
Kate: Carl, the reviews are over. Quit
making stuffup. So long, folks, the reviewers
have left the building.

Soma, one of Swat's newest bands, will be performing at Palmer lounge tonight at 10:00 p.m. The show
will consist of eleven original songs plus four covers to
round out the set.
The group consists ofTed Melillo '97 (guitar), Adam Busch '97
(drums), Dan Sachar '97 (keyboard), Laura Barandes '99 (vocals),
Alex Stimmel '97, (bass). Stimmel is also the bass player for Dr.
Booty.
Heavenly Soma formed in February and have been playing
together a lot since then. They tried out three singers before picking
Barandes, whose powerful voice is one of the band's best attributes. Their first show was at Pub Nite the week after spring
break. "We've gotten much better since then," noted Sachar. They
also played a few songs at Harambee, but as they explain, the
Palmer show "is our first show where you can go and dance."

Sachar describes the group as "a very eclectic danceable, blues/
rock/funk." Barandes reemphasizes the point. "We play a little bit
of everything," she says, "we are a very eclectic band."
Theirbest songs include "The Funk," which, as the title implies,
is very funky and very danceable. "Other People" and "Pimp Car"
are among the band's other favorites.
"We all contribute [to the songs]," said Sachar. The main
musical lines come from Melillo and the main lyricist is Stimmel,
but both of them write a lot ofmusic. "Mostly we all throw around
ideas. It is rarely one person who comes in and says 'Here's a song
I wrote.'"
There hasn't been a band performance at Palmer lounge since
spring 1995, but Sachar insists that it is a great place to play. "It
is not too big, there is enough room for people to dance, and you
get a cool party feeling."
Tonight's show will be free. The band will play two sets from
10:00 p.m.-2:00 a.m., and there will be a DJ for the down time.

This weekend was one ofthe more
exciting weekends for a fast and furious contingent on the men's track
team. Coach Ted Dixon took two of
the men's premier relay teams to the
Penn Relays, the largest track meet of
the year, while a small squadron of
athletes battled it out at the Greyhound Invitational.
The men's relay teams departed
for the Penn Relays amidst swarms of
athletes, from high school teams to
masters competitors; the Swat 4x400
and 4xloo teams went to war.
Eric Pakurar '97 led off the 4x400,
running a 52.6 for the first quarter,
handing off to Sam Paschel '96, who
careened into the exchange zone at a
51.3. Mason Tootell '99 kept the pace
strong, coming through at a 51.4.
Mike Turner '96 unleashed the final
spurt of blazing speed, coming
through at 49.5 to put the team up in
third place overall.
Tootell and Turner joined Brian
Baird '99 and Reuben Canada '99 in
the 4xloo, in which they displayed
the finest in fast twitch fury, getting
the baton around in 44.73.
At the Greyhound, Chris Hourigan
'96 gave his best performance yet for
the season, coming through at 23.9 in
the 200. A beautiful display of teamwork, reminiscent of Cross-Country
magic, was exhibited in the 1500, in
which Graham Lucks '9B, Duncan
Kirkpatrick '99, and John Freeman
'96 worked together all the way
through the race. Lucks zapped into
the finish at 4:09, followed by
Kirkpatrick and Freeman at 4:10 and
4:11, respectively. Fred Gerson '99
hit the exact same pace in the next
heat with a 4:09.
Having fine-tuned their racing
abilities and riding on the momentum
of possibly the best track season thus
far, the Swarthmore athletes will now
be gearing up for the championship
season, unquestionably the most exciting part of spring track. The first
chapter will take place on the home
turf during the Conference Championships this Saturday and Sunday.

Women's Track Relay Takes Penn Gold
Week With Two Victories

I arrive at the bright University

City stop on the R3 and the signs
announce it clearly: Penn Relays
up the stairs to the left. As I emerge
into the noise of Philadelphia traffic, the banners fly above me and
street vendors hawk their T-shirts.
In groups of four, girls and women
in matching warm-up gear push
past me. Some talk or joke nervously while others stare straight
ahead in fright. It is Thursday of
the 102nd running of Penn Relays, one of the most renowned
track relay meets in the country,
and in just a while, they will be
circling the expansive oval at
Franklin Field with all eyes on
them. They certainly have a right
to be nervous.
My time will come, too, but at
the moment I worry about getting
into thestadium without my ticket.
I slip through the seemingly endless gridlock of school buses and
into the stadium with a few smiles
and a UV-detectable hand stamp.
As I look into the stands for the
rest of the Swarthmore women's
team, I see an endless sea offaces.
The countless runners have attracted countless fans.
The 4xloom team of Danielle
Duffy '9B, Jill Wildonger '97,
CatherineLaine '9B and Stephanie
Herring '99 return from a welldeserved lunch break and tell me
about their race. The women made
a strong showing in their heat,
finishing with a fiery schoolrecord-breaking time of51.23 seconds. This is the first time in recent history that the women have
been strong enough to enter the
more competitive open 4xloo
eventattheRelays. They are happy
with their performance, doubtless
quickened by the recent team upgrade from running shorts to

"butthuggers."
The races continue with a certain urgency throughout the afternoon. I can't help but let my jaw
drop occasionally as high school

Men's Track
at Penn Meet

from Pennsylvania and St. Jago from
Jamaica, come through in under 3:48.
The Penn Relays, as well as hosting
local teams, draw high quality runners from afar. The lightning quickness of some athletes and the longer
strides of others inspire admiration
from all onlookers. It is impossible to
run in the Penn Relays without wearing your athleticheart on your sleeve;
each runner gives 100percent. It is an
exciting meet because there are no
excuses; the air and your body battle
you, but everything else, including
the excitement in the stadium, drives
you to bring the baton around the
track. For being composed of such
scrambling, desperate races, it is a

surprisingly elegant meet.
After a short nap on the aluminum
benches, the team and I leave the
crowded stadium to warm up for the
4x400m relay. Our jog takes us
through the UPenn quad and over
Broad Street, past hundreds of students out of class for the day. We
sprint into the gusty wind and stretch
on a lawn strewn with litter and broken glass. The return jog is quiet with
meditative preparation for the upcoming race. Our team is undefeated
in the Centennial Conference, and
since our heat is Middle Atlantic Division 111, the chance of victory is
high.
The fun really begins when we line
up with familiar faces from the other
eight teams in the paddock before the
race. Danielle and Jill, old hands at
the Relays, are positively giddy. The
blood starts flowing early, however,
when Danielle is spiked in the leg by
a ditzy Gettysburg runner. Right at
5:55 p.m. we are led onto the track in
a kind of army formation.
Before I realize it, Catherine steps
to the line and the gun goes off. I
watch as she extricates herselffrom a
jumbled pack of runners, extending
her stride from third to fifth gear. As
she rounds the 200 mark, I rouse
enough mathematical function from
my fluttering brain to determine that
she holds strong in fourth place, and
so I take my place for the hand-off.
Catherine bounds down the final
stretch with a confident stride and a

m

wild look in her eyes.
I wave her on, and before I know
it, I am flying after a Messiah
runner with a hollow metal tube in
my hand. The adrenaline in my
body insists that I can catch her,
but at the 200 mark, my legs tell
me otherwise, so I fixate on the
back of her neck and drive my
knees as hard and fast as I can.
Danielle takes the baton from me
effortlessly and I step woodenly
to the inside ofthe track. A worker
takes my elbow and encourages
me to "walk it out."
When my eyes come into focus,
see
Danielle shooting into first
I
place, smoking the competition.
A quick glance at the track clock
as she passes to Jill shows me that
we are well within the range of
breaking the previous school
record of 4:08.88.
"You got it, Jill," I scream as
she powers by. And indeed she did
have it; her strides eat up the track
and she crosses the finish line in a
winning time of 4:03.63. She
throws up her hands in joy and we
join her for a cheerful group hug.
I'm sure the euphoria was contagious; it was so exhilarating to
win a major race together after
practicing so hard since early November. The splits for each 400
were 62.1, 63.8, 58.2, and 59.5
seconds, personal records for me
and Danielle. Our coach hopes we
can each shed some more time in
upcoming races in order to qualify
for Nationals. An official even let
Jill keep a priceless official Penn
Relays baton. So the baton, I believe, will hang next to the championship plaque in Coach Ted
Dixon's office, all to commemorate the success of April 25,1996.

Men's Lacrosse Falls to Haverford
By

Pat

Donaghy

Last Saturday, the men's lacrosse
team hosted Haverford with the opportunity to wrap up the Hood Tro-

phy and defeat their arch rivals for
the first time since 1990. With nearly
identical records and tensions which
have built up between the two teams
over the course of the year, the duel
would be nothing short of a sixty
minute battle.
However, as the battle started, the
Garnetshot themselves in the foot by
committing four penalties which led
to four Black Squirrel first quarter
goals. The Garnet lost their composure during this time and internal
conflicts were ripping the team apart.
The quarter ended with a 7-2 score
and left the Garnet scratching their
heads.
At this point, Coach Pat Gress
needed to do something to settle the
team down. The Garnet switched to a
zone defense and a ball control offense to start the second quarter. This
ploy by Coach Gress changed the
game dramatically and the Garnet
began to crawl back into the game.
Goals by Andy Place '96, Will Craig
'96 and Pat Donaghy '9B, along with
overall stellar defensive play cut the
deficit to 7-5 within minutes.
While Swarthmore showed how
fast a lacrosse game could change,
Haverford retaliated by scoring four
goals themselves resulting in a 11-5
halftime deficit facing the Garnet.
At the start of the second half,

Swarthmore began another comeback. Two more ofPlace's five goals
overall closed the gap to 11-7, but
Haverford's stellarmiddie Jeff Jollon
(six goals, five assists) scored two
quick goals to extend the lead back to
six. Every timethat the Garnet saw an
opening in which they could get back
into the game, Haverford seemed to
find an answer. The teams traded
goals therest ofthe game as Haverford
ran away with a 17-11 victory in a
contest in which no team let up until
after the final whistle.
Swarthmore finished the season 310, but there were many bright spots
throughout the season. "The senior
leadership was outstanding. I can't
say enough about those guys. They
showed up every day fifteen minutes
before practice, ready to play. They
were the backbone of this team," said
Coach Gress. The seniors accumulated 80% of the goals and 90% of the
assists in their final year. Indeed, the
Garnet will dearly miss the nine
graduating players, as well as defensive middie Alex DeShields '9B, who
is transferring.
Swarthmore is left with just eleven
players on the squad. In comparison,
only four Gettysburg players graduating to leave this the Centennial
Conference opponent with 48 players to work with. There are five projected recruits for next year. However, the future does not look very
pretty. Only two players with more
than one goal return among the eleven
and only three starters.

But there could be a bright future
for the Garnet. If anyone can turn the
program around, Coach Gress is the
one who can do it. He is a great
motivator and works well with what
he has.
Aaron Hultgren '9B has regularly
played well in guarding the opponents' best player all year. Attackman
Adam Macßeth '99 developed into a
good finisher by year's end. Middies
Erik Johnson '9B, Pete Karacki '9B,
Pete Hamilton '97, and Bryan Berg
'97 are ready to step into the forefront. Along with the return of Dave
Martinez '97 and Donaghy, the middies should be fine. All-American
high school Goalie Ben Henwood
97 also returns, as does current goalie
Elijah Porter '99, who madeoutstanding saves in each of the Garnet's
three wins.

Men's Tennis Avoids Bullets, but not Penn
By

John Derderian

This Saturday, while most Swatties
were lying out on Parrish beach, soaking in the sun, the sights and the
sounds ofHarambe, the men's tennis
team was at the University of Pennsylvania, ready to do two things. Arriving just in time to see the Quakers
take down Ivy League rival Columbia 4-3, the Swarthmore team was
amazed at the over 50,000 people
assembled for the event (Coach
Mullan had the unenviable duty of
informing the team that the crowd
was there for the Penn Relays, not the
tennis match).
After an extended warm-up, the
doubles competition got underway
with Swarthmore holding their own
at all three positions. Recently promoted Greg Emkey '99 and John
Derderian' 97 won theirmatch at 2nd
doubles, while Ist (Roger Werner
'9B and Barry Mook '96) and 3rd
(Nicky Slimack '99 and Eddie Ernst

'9B) both lost close games.
After uncharacteristically surrendering the doubles
point, the Bandits
headedinto singles
with renewed
vigor after a pep
talk in which
Mullansaidto"get
ready for battle."
Little did he know
how prophetic his
words would be,
when 15 minutes

into the matches an
unidentified man
pulled a gun behind the first
singles court. The people in the vicinity began screaming and running from
the gunman, causing a hysteria for
over ten minutes.
The tennis courts were trampled by
humans interested in self-preservation. In a post match discussion
Swarthmore's international team re-

latedthe incident to their experiences

abroad: Mook compared it to guerrilla fighting in
the
Sudan;
Werner saw a
similarity to the
coup d'etat in
Venezuela; 2nd
singles player
George Khalaf
'96
recalled
memories of religious strife in
Lebanon. Freshman Slimack,
from the Midwest, compared
the incident to
last Thursday's episode of COPS.
After all off the commotion had
settled down, the match proceeded
with all players acquitting themselves
nicely. Emkey would have won at 6th
singles, but he got "totally hooked"
(and he never got a hot dog). Mook
hung tough at Ist singles, losing a

nailbiter to a former member of the
Mossad, and Derderian fell in a third
set tie break at 4th singles. While the
Bandits lost the match, they did garner a compliment from the Penn
coach, an ex-Navyman, who was
overheard saying "I haven't seen boys
that tough since Grenada." With everyone salty after their defeat, the
team sat down to a grudgingly satisfying pre-formal dinner.
The team received good news when
they found out they had been given a
bid to the national tournament. They
will compete in the regional at
Binghamton next weekend (where a
possible semifinal rematch with
Amherst is looming). If the Bandits
reach the finals they will qualify for
the "elite eight" round in Atlanta.
Seniors Khalaf andMook, noting that
this is their last shot at a National
Championship, had four words of
advice for the underclassmen:
"SUCK IT UP, YO!"

Baseball Finishes Season
With Winning Record
Team Swept by Ursinus, but Sweeps Haverford
By

Francis Amar

Very quietly, the GranetTidefound
itselfembroiled in a pennant race last
week. While most attention was focused elsewhere on the Swarthmore
athletic scene, the GarnetTide headed
into last week's action with an outside shot of winning a piece of the
Centennial Conference crown, not
bad for a team that had set up shop in
the Centennial Conference basement
the past two seasons. To achieve that
feat, the Garnet Tide needed to win
each ofits remaining four games, two
against conference leading Ursinus
and two against Haverford.
Unfortunately, the magic carpet
ride was over before you could say
"pennant fever." Last Tuesday, the
Tide made the trek across Delaware
County to face the conference leading Bears. As has been the case, the
Garnet Tide exploded for an early 50 lead. But Ursinus, a good hitting
team, could not be kept down for long
and starter Sam Voolich '96 could do
little to stop the flood of runs. The
end result was a 14-11 defeat, shattering any dreams of a conference
title.
Still, the Tide had one more crack
at the Bears. The dark storm clouds
and periods of rain before the game
might have served as an omen that
things would not go well. Chuck
Hudson '96 took to the hill, looking
to notch his seventh win of the season. However, the vaunted Garnet
Tide attack came up a little empty,
and Hudson didn't have his good
stuff as the Tide fell 11-2.
Last Saturday, the Garnet Tide concluded theirconference schedule with
a twinbill against Haverford. Down
early, the Garnet Tide tied the score

at 5 on a Frank Santora '96 two-run

triple, and took the lead when Pat
Straub '97 singled him home. With a
6-5 lead, it appeared as though the
Tide would wrap things up, but a
mental mistake by Ben Sousa '9B
allowed the tying run to get on base
and eventually score.
The teams battled scoreless into
extra innings. Drew Clayton '96
helped win the game with a pop-up
single that triggered a four run rally
and made a winner out of Jeremy
Bonder '97 (3-0), who had relieved
Sousa. In Game 2, a three-run dinger
by Bob Mascia '96 got the ball rolling. Haverford would tie things up,
but two runs in the sth and four more
in the 6th effectively put the game out
of reach, and Straub pitched the last
three innings to pick up the save.
Even though Tuesday's make-up
game against Delaware Valley was
cancelled because of rain, the Tide
nonetheless finished with a 17-13-1
record, good for a share of third place
in the Centennial Conference.

Swat Keeps Hood Trophy
for 2nd Year—Or Does it?
By

David Lischer

Swarthmore Women' s Lacrosse
team handily defeated Haverford

on Tuesday. This victory, in the
eves ofthe lacrosse team and most
other Swarthmore students interested in the competition, clinched
the Hood Trophy forSwarthmore.
Swarthmore and Haverford
competed head-to-head in three
sports last week:
baseball, softball,
and men's and
women's lacrosse.
In short, these games
determined the winner of the Hood Trophy, which is awarded
to the college which
won the most head-tohead contests during th<
year. A point in the stanc
ings is awarded in eac
sport.
Swarthmore prevailed
baseball and women's lacrosse,
and Haverford took the men's lacrosse point. The colleges split the
softball point. It seemed that this
week spelled victory and retention of the Hood Trophy for a
second consecutive year.
However, according to the program at last weekend's baseball
doubleheader, Haverford claimed
to hold a two point leadrather than
to share a tie before the week's
action. This is a result of Haver-

Last Saturday, the women's rugby
encountered some tough competition from the women of the University ofDelaware. Although, in the
A-side game, Swarthmore was able
to hold Delaware to only one try in
the second half, Delaware still prevailed 20-0. The B-side game followed the same tune 24-3.
"The team really came together
towards the end of the game," said
Kelly Shannon '96. In the second
half of the A-side game, when it
seemed like Delaware was getting
tired, Swarthmore came on strong.
Although Swat could not find the
tryzone either, Delaware didn't get
many chances to score break-away
team

tries, after an adjustment by
Swarthmore's wings. In the B-side
game, the team started off the game
stronger than they ended it, putting
up a blank in the second half.
The Swarthmore forwards, once
again, drove the Delaware forwards
back in every scrum. The props on
their team had a tendency to pull
down Swarthmore's props when they
engaged, which brought the scrum
down. Swarthmore had the opportunity to run a couple of their plays off
the scrum, in which a flanker took
and posted the ball off the side of the
scrum.
The Delaware backs ran fast and
passed the ball off quickly, giving
the Swarthmore backs their toughest
challenge so far this season. Although

the dispute has raised the eyebrows ofmany concerned studentathletes and is currently in the

Women's Softball Wins
One Game, Loses Three
By Mary Elizabeth

Alvarez

This week was an emotional one
for softball. Swarthmore has suffered
losses in all directions from a close
fight to Gettysburg to a inexplicable
whomping from Haverford. The
team's performance in the last half of
the season was erratic. However, this
is a big improvement from the
uncompetitive or passionless play
exhibited in the beginning of the season. It was easy to see that the team
had finally begun to pull together to
play as a unit. Since Allentown, the
outfield has been playing as if they
had much more experience than they
actually do with more errorless games.
Infield errors have decreased dramatically as they rally around the
team phenomenon and captain, Dana
Lehman '9B.
She has worked a minor miracle
this season, being-the sole pitcher for
the team
an unheard of idea in
collegiate softball. Starting and finishing every game since Florida besides the second game of the Drew
doubleheader (where catcher April
Dunning '99 made a terrific showing), Lehman has showed gamesense
far beyond heryears ofpitching (now
totaling a whopping 1.5). Doing the
best with what she has in her arsenal,
she has put up a consistent fight
against batters of all skill levels.
Four outstanding seniors will be
missed incredibly when they graduate. Alejandra Gonzalez '96 has been
a powerhouse of support and spirit
for the team. Putting effort before
attitude, she has given 100% to
Swarthmore softball for the past four
years. Mollie Davis '96 had a tough
switch this year from catcher to outfield and has made great strides at
this new position. Even when playing only in the offensive lineup, she
has shown what a little hip can do!
Laura Pitman '96 came back to the
outfield this year after a season spent
in Italy. With her rocket arm, she has

ford deciding this is the year to
include men's and women's indoor track in the standings.
There are arguments on both
sides. Indoor track is a varsity
sport, and all other varsity sports
are included in the standings, so
indoor track would logically be
included. However, indoor track
was not included last year, and
there has been no change in the

in this game their reputation seemed
to outdo theirplay, theDelaware backs
were very talented. They managed to
pass off the ball just before being
tackled by a Swarthmore back. Their
wings would run wide down the edge
of the field. It was in this way that they
scored most of their tries. However in
the second half this didn't happen, as
the back captain, Rebecca Cole '96
rearranged line so that the last person
would be outside the wing.
This weekend will wrap up the 1996
spring season of women's rugby with

been a major element in the success
of the outfield this year. Many thanks
go to Vanessa Motto '96, captain and
first-baseman. With very little experience at first base, she has led by
example showing what focus and
dedication are all about. She kept the
team in line and given direction to a
sometimes errant program.
It's not easy to play a season like
they've played. If it's not pitching,
it's batting, or the weather that's the
problem. Every game was a struggle
to stay alive in the conference and be
able to leave thefieldrespecting themselves. Congratulations to every
player on the team who stuck out the
season with nothing less than
Herculean endurance.
