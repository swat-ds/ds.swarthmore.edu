Pennsylvania who died in the war in Iraq.
The "Eyes Wide Open" exhibit uses boots to represent some of the soldiers from eastern
Iraq War.

BY LILY GOODSPEED

lgoodsl@swarthmore.edu
Sergeant

Jennifer Hartman of New

Ringgold, Pennsylvania entered the military when she was 17 years old. Four
years later a suicide bombing killed her
and two fellow soldiers near an electrical
substation at her barracks in Baghdad.
On Monday, a pair of boots stood
alongside 18 others on the second floor of
McCabe Library as memorials to
-

Hartman and other soldiers of Eastern
Pennsylvania who died in Iraq.
The "Eyes Wide Open" memorial
exhibit filled an entire room in McCabe
Library with 15 pairs of boots from soldiers of Philadelphia and four pairs from
soldiers of Chester County. In addition
to the shoes themselves, there were also
notes and mementos left inside by family members.
The exhibit was organized by the
American Friends Service Committee
and sponsored by the Peace and Conflict
Studies Program and Swarthmore's
Students for a Democratic Society.
George Lakey, former peace and conflict
studies professor and current Research
Associate at the Lang Center, gave a lecture in conjunction with the exhibit.
'Eyes Wide Open' serves as a memorial, but also helps keep the Iraq War in
the consciousness of Swarthmore students," said Andy Forrest 'l2, a member
of Swarthmore SDS. "It tends to be overlooked, even after the new administration."
Each pair of boots showed the name
and hometown of a soldierkilled in Iraq.
They served as a physical reminder of
the cost of America's ongoing war.
"It was important for us to bring
something to coincide, with the anniversary of the war in Iraq," said Henry
Linder 'l2, a member of SDS.
The memorial was on Monday

Scilla Wahrhaftig, the Program
Director of the American Friends Service
Committee in Pennsylvania, said that is
the 56th Eyes Wide Open exhibit that she

has brought to Pennsylvania. Wahrhaftig
noted the particular importance the
exhibit has in this state, as Pennsylvania
has the third largest number of casualties
in the Iraq War.
"I bring the exhibit round but it's the
local group that decides how it should go,
and does all the outreach," Wahrhaftig
said. "It's a group effort."
Wahrhaftig chose a couple of pairs of
boots to describe in detail. The first pair
belonged to Hartman. As she was underage, her father signed a permission form.

"He signed her up because the contract said she wouldn't go to Iraq, but the
small print said that the Army could not
be held to anything on the contract,"
Wahrhaftig said.
Another pair belonged to Nick Berg, a
native of West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Though Wahrhaftig noted that Nick Berg
was a military contractor, not a solider,
she said, "He was a contractor in a different sense. He didn't go for the money; he
went to help the Iraqi people."
Wahrhaftig said that she hopes the
exhibit will also remind Pennsylvanians
about the importance of support groups
for returning soldiers.

Committee to examine
purchasing guidelines

WEEK IN PICTURES

Vertigo-go performs comedy skits in their Genderfuck costumes on Saturday night in
Mephistos lounge.

Andrew Cheng Phoenix Staff

Andy Crouch, author of "Culture Making" and husband ofassociate professor of physics
Catherine Crouch, gives a lecture entitled "Creative Excellence" on Friday in Kohlberg.

In response to the controversy over
the return of Coca-Cola products three
years after the Kick Coke campaign
banned them from campus, the administration has formed the ad hoc Committee
on Purchaser Responsibility to determine the purchasing ethical responsibilities of the college and recommend policy changes if needed.
"The first charge of the committee is
to decide whether the college needs a policy," Vice President for Facilities and
Services Stu Hain said. "If they decide
that the college needs a policy, then they
are to develop the policy and develop a
mechanism to implement the policy."
If the committee does end up drafting
a policy, it will have to recommend ways
to carry out the policy, due to be
installed for the 2011-2012 budget, without negatively impacting the college's
budget, Hain said.
The committee is composed of three
students, Paul Eisenberg 'l2, Emily
Dolson 'l3 and Ben Hattem 'l2; two staff
members, Nadine Kolowrat, associate
director of Corporate, Foundation, and
Government Relations . (CFGR) and
Carmen Duffy, investment associate of
the
Committee
on
Investor
Responsibility; and three faculty members, David Cohen, associate professor of
astronomy, Hansjakob Werlen, professor
of German and coordinator of the
GermanStudies program; and Erin Todd
Bronchetti, associate professor of economics. Director of the College
Bookstore Kathy Grace was appointed
chair by the president's staff.
"Perhaps the most important and difficult job of the committee speaking as
an economist
will be to consider the
true costs of any of our recommendations," Bronchetti said. "Thus, it will be
crucial for us to weigh whether the benefits of more responsible purchasing outweigh the value and benefits of whatever
must be given up."
The decisions of the committee will
be facilitated by the ethical purchasing
research that was carried out last semester by Zein Nakhoda 'l2 and Rebecca
Kranz 'l3. Their work culminated to a
report titled "A Review of Ethical
Purchasing Guidelines," a copy of which
will be provided to each of the nine members of the committee.
Clients involved in ethical purchasing take into account the labor practices
and environmental sustainability of different companies before making purchasing decisions. Part of the committee's charge will be to come up with its
own definitionof the practice.
"The two interns researched procedures and plans at other colleges and
universities regarding ethical purchasing particularly as they related to labor
practices and to environmental sustainability," said Joy Charlton, executive
director of the Lang Center who oversaw
the research, in an e-mail. "Having such
research at hand means that wheels
don't have to be re-invented.
This
process can stimulate creativity as well
as generate wisdom."
Controversy over Coke products on
the campus over the past couple years
prompted this research and consequently the formation of this new committee.
In 2006, several students initiated a

Kick Coke campaign in order to use consumer purchasing power to protest the
company's unethical labor practices.
The campaign was successful in abolishing Coke products from campus, but this
past fall, due to economic pressure and
improvements in the company's labor
practices, the administration decided to
reinstate Coke products. To prevent
future conflicts, Kick Coke campaign
activists asked the administration to
consider adopting an ethical purchasing
policy. Now a year later, a committee to
assess the demand of a policy is taking

shape.
"I think I see it, more than anything,
as an important mechanism to oversee
Swarthmore's operations and try to
make it so that Swarthmore is abiding
by an ethical standard, purchasing
goods, services, etc.," said Alfredo
Chuquihuara 10, member of the
Swarthmore Labor Action Project.
Dan Symonds 'll, student council
financial policy representative, and
Deivid Rojas 'l£ StuCo vice president,
both recognize the significant role of the
Committee on Purchaser Responsibility.
"We need to build more trust and this
is a great way," Symonds said. "By letting students have access to purchasing

information detailed information I
think that we can build a lot of trust and
prove that there's not a whole lot of disagreement between students and the
managers about how we can move this
college forward."
Recent controversy regarding the
labor practices of Alliedßarton is not
connected to the formation of the
Committee on Purchaser Responsibility,
Hain said. Yet, student activists still
hope that the committee will put the
Alliedßarton controversy first on its
agenda.

"We want Swarthmore to be held
accountable for the type of work they're

contracting out and what that means for

the actual workers. Once the committee
becomes established, I do hope that one
of the first actions they take is to study
this process with Alliedßarton,"
Chuquihuara said.
While the committee was not formed
specifically to rectify the Alliedßarton
issue, it will probably examine the problem and develop a process in which similar issues can be vetted, Grace said.
"As chair of meetings, I see my
responsibility primarily as making sure
the meeting goes well and that we get
accomplished what we're supposed to
get accomplished and that the voices of
the individual members of the committee get heard," Grace said.
The three student positions on the
committee were available and publicized
to the entire student body, but interest
levels were low to the point that StuCo
Appointments Chair Sonja Spoo 'l3 was
forced to extend the deadline of the applications. Nevertheless, StuCo was able to
select three well-qualified applicants to
fill those positions, Spoo said.
"I think this is a very, very important
committee for this school, especially for
students who like to be active," Rojas
said.

According to Spoo, the committee
will have its first meeting before the
beginning of next week. Students, staff
and faculty are all hopeful that the committee will commit to its charges before
the end of the semester.

a debate, and it
was by no means unanimous, but we
had to talk through the pros and cons."
The decision was based on discusstudents,
Resident
sions
with
administrators,
and
Assistants
Assistant Dean of Residential Life
Rachel Head said.
This change means that first-years
will no longer have the option of smoking housing. Head said in an e-mail,
however, that typically less than two
percent of the incoming first-years
classes have indicated a desire for
smoking housing on their forms in
years past.
And in the 415 questionnaires
which includes first-years and transfer
students
filled out for this year,
Head said that only four indicated
that they were planning on smoking in
their rooms. Since Hallowell ranges
from about 30 to 40 first-year students
each year,
Head said that this means about 20
to 25 first-year students who did not
request smoking housing are placed in
Hallowell each year.
"We don't have enough of every type
of housing to make everybody happy,"
Head said.
The Housing Committee discussed
Hallowell's smoking policy last year,
as well, but last year's mouse infestation "took precedence," Head said.
In addition to making Hallowell
non-smoking, Head said first-year
Mary Lyons residents will be guaranteed on-campus housing as sophomores.
In an effort to gauge student opinion
about the smoking policy, Head emailed a survey to the student body on
Feb. 28. With 600 student responses and
over 20 pages of comments, the survey
had about 60 percent of those surveyed
supporting a ban on smoking in
Hallowell, according to Head. She
added that concerns of both smokers
and non-smokers were discussed, and
some students were even contacted

rettes.

.

"I

wasn't

expecting to get

so many comments about an issue* outside of cigarette smoking," Head said.
"Students [were] feeling like their
peers respect the non-smoking rule for
cigarettes but don't respect the nonsmoking rule for marijuana."
While many of the survey's comments expressed uncertainty about
how to deal with students smoking
marijuana in the dorms, Head said that
she plans to further train RAs to specifically facilitate discussions about dorm
marijuana use for this coming year.
Anna Levine 'l2 said that she moved
out of Hallowell's third floor because
the smoke was causing health problems. Though Hallowell originally
seemed preferable to other housing
options, Levine said that she felt she
had to move out after persistent illness, aggravated asthma and the recommendation of Worth Health Center.
"I knew that [Hallowell] was a smoking dorm, but I didn't really think that
anyone would actually be smoking,"
Levine said.
Hallowell resident Ben DeGolia 'll
said that he chose Hallowell for its
location next to the Crum Woods but
was disappointed with the prevalence
of smoke.
"They shouldn't make us choose
between the Crum and healthy lungs

why
"Hallowell now is a smoke box. On a
good day, I walk through the hall holding my breath or wincing at the stench.
On a bad day, I have to keep my own
windows open for clean air."
Head said that there is also a shortage of RAs who are willing to work in
smoking dorms.
Ayman Abu Nimer 'l2, who will be
an RA on the first floor of Hallowell
next year, said that he was concerned
about the potential policy change during the application process.
"I'm an athlete, we have sensitive

smoking policy were considered, but
none really appeared feasible, Head

said.
For example, this past year, the
Housing Committee tried to encourage
upperclassmen who smoked to block
for either the second or third floors of
the dorm as a way to keep smoke out of
the basement and the first floor, which
have a higher concentration of firstyear students.
"I don't know maybe if it wasn't
clear enough or maybe we should have
made the request a bit stronger, but it
was there and what we found is that it
wasn't effective," Head said.
Hallowell basement RA Ashley
Davies 'lO said, however, that she has-,

"The presence of smoke in the basement is pretty much nonexistent," said
Davies, a non-smoker. "I've heard no

being in Hallowell."
Aaron Kramer 'l3, a basement
Hallowell resident, agreed that smoking in the basement is rare. "It was just
me and my roommate who smoked on
our hall, and in the rest of the building
it's fairly common."
Kramer said he would support a policy that turned Hallowell into a residence for smokers only. "There are
smokers who are not in smoking buildings and non-smokers who are in
smoking buildings, and I think some
policies made to rectify that discrepancy could help a lot," Kramer said.
Head said that it would be difficult
to regulate this because Hallowell has

For this story, The Phoenix disseminated a survey for residents through
the RAs. There were 29 total respondents.
Of 19 upperclassmen Hallowell residents on the basement, first and third
floors, only three said that Hallowell's
smoking policy was a reason for their
choice of residence in last year's housing policy.

All respondents were asked to rate
their overall smoking dorm experience
on a scale from one to 10 (one being, "I
hate it," and 10 being, "I love it"), over
50 percent of respondents gave a score
at or below five. Seventy-two percent of
respondents were non-smokers.

New blocks may also be added for
next year, but many of the specifics are
still being discussed.
Increased gender neutral housing is
also still under discussion, but an
unlikely change for next year, Head

STUCO HIGHLIGHTS

StuCo positions may become paid
Council
discussed
Student
whether StuCo positions should be
paid in future years.
All the members present agreed
that they should be paid because the
jobs are both time-consuming and
necessary for the community.
There were also concerns that the
unpaid nature of the positions
deterred many work-study students
from participating.
For example, students on workstudy have to meet a certain number
of hours of work, and might not be
able to devote time to StuCo responsibilities.
Nate Erskine 'lO, the former Vice
President of StuCo who attended this
meeting said that he thought paid
StuCo positions would be a good
idea.
"I know it would have been
impossible for me to be on StuCo
while doing an honors chemistry
major and holding down a job," he
said.
Rachel Bell 'lO, the StuCo
President, mentioned that it could be
difficult to accurately tally hours for
a student time sheet, and suggested
that only time spent in meetings be
counted.
StuCo members also discussed
where the money for their paychecks
could possibly come from.

March 25, 2010

Because StuCo manages the
Student Budget Committee, which
controls the Student Activities Fund,
it was decided that the money should
probably not come from the Student
Activities Fund.
The cost might be split between
the Student Activities Fund and the
administration, but there are concerns that the administration will
not want to provide wages for any
student group.
In order to hear other student
voices, StuCo plans to host an open
forum and create a survey. Both will
be open to the entire student body.
StuCo also intends to send a letter
to the editor ofeach student newspapers explaining the benefits of making this decision. Next Tuesday there
will be a StuCo Lounge in Paces during cafe hours to discuss the issue.
StuCo Elections
Student Council plans to begin
the voting process for new members
by the week of April 18 but hopes
that they will know whether the
positions will be paid before the elections.
They expect that more people,
from a broader background, will run
if the positions have salaries.

Students march at rally for immigration reform
BY JACQUELINE SMALL
jsmall2@swarthmore.edu
20
roughly
Sunday,
Last
Swarthmore students were among
thousands shouting "Si, se puede," or
"Yes, we can," at the March for
America, a rally for immigration
reform in Washington, D.C. These students were part of the DREAM Act
Coalition, a recently formed student
group that is lobbying for the passage
of the Development Relief and
Education of Alien Minors Act.
"There was something really powerful about seeing people from all over
the country come together," said
Evelyn Fraga 'l3, one of the group's
founders. "[This issue] affects everyone, from all different cultures, and
seeing that diversity was really mov-

ing."

If passed, the DREAM Act would
give six years of conditional legal status to undocumented immigrants who
were minors when they entered the
United States, provided that they meet

certain criteria at the time of the law's
passage.
During that time, they must complete two years of college or military
service and be of "good moral character." Children who are older than 12
and are enrolled full-time in primary
or secondary school will also not be
deportation until they are 16, when
they can apply for the program.
The students described March for
America, one of the coalition's several
recent activities, as powerful and
inspirational. "There were a lot of people, like, thousands of people, all gathered up [in front of the Capitol
Building] and everybody was chanting," said Jovanna Hernandez 'l3,
another founder of the group.
The march featured several speakers who detailed the need for immigration reform, and Hernandez was
particularly impressed by a video of
President Obama thanking people for
marching and promising to work on
the issue. She noted that when the
video was played, the crowd fell completely silent.
The group decided to go to the
march together when Jusselia Molina
'l3, another founder, discussed it in a
meeting.

"I've always participated in marches before, in New York, so personally I
knew I would be going to this one, but
didn't know it would be a Swat thing,"
she said. "When I mentioned it to the
group, we got a really good response."
The students left around 9 a.m. on
Sunday to meet up with the rest of the
DREAM Act delegation, which included students from all over the country,
including Colorado, Illinois and New
York.
"You just got an amazing feeling of
unity and a sense of compassion for
fellow human beings," said Luis
Penate 'l3, who attended the march.
Molina said that because of the
healthcare votes taking place on
Sunday, the march received little
media attention.
The group struggled to get funding,
mainly because they did not realize
the full extent of what they had to pay
for.
"It was hard to figure out funding,"

Swarthmore students were among thousands lobbying for passage of the DREAM Act in Washington on Sunday.
Molina said. "This Friday we were

running around scrambling for ways
to get money, but SBC was really help-

ful."

Eventually the group was able to go
through Students for a Democratic
Society, which has a budget for travel

expenses and funded them.
Rafael Zapata, the assistant dean
and director of the Intercultural
Center who acts as a mentor for the
group, said he knew that the IC also
supported at least one van, "which
[they] were happy to do."
The group also held a panel discussion on Monday, which had panelists
including an immigration lawyer, several activists and potential beneficiaries of the act. They discussed the bill's
strengths
and
weaknesses
and
answered students' questions.
"I thought the panel went wonderfully, and the turnout was great especially since we were a little behind on
advertising," Fraga said. "[Those
speakers] gave more of a personal
touch."
The students have many plans for
the future, including formally chartering the group. They will also show a
documentary called "Papers the
Movie: Stories of Undocumented
Youth" on April 2 in Kohlberg 226.
The coalition was also chosen to
participate
Debating

Project Pericles. Kimberly St. Julian
'l2 and Katherine Lam 'll will debate
the issue in front of a judging panel of
former and current senators.
Zapata said, "They've been very

Most of our Conversations took place in the planning
process and I think they've taken off,
and they've been very effective."
"We're still trying to raise awareness and make ourselves known to the
campus so people can become more
informed and involved," Fraga said.

Alumna to study Middle East as Carnegie Fellow

"[Revkin] was a fabulous candidate for this," said
Melissa Mandos, fellowships and prizes advisor.
"Clearly adding to the excitement is that we hadn't had
one in awhile."
Although Revkin does not yet have an assignment,
Junior Fellows "have the opportunity to conduct
research for books, co-author journal articles and policy papers, participate in meetings with high-level officials, contribute to congressional testimony and organize briefings attended by scholars, journalists and government officials," according to the endowment's website.

studies since her first year at Swarthmore, Mara

Bryn Mawr names new Dean of Undergraduate College
BY ELIZABETH HELD

BICONEWS.COM, MARCH 23, 2010
In
talking
with Dr.
Michele
Rasmussen, Bryn Mawr's newly appointed dean of the undergraduate college, it
seems she already understands a key
piece of Bryn Mawr's culture.
"I really like to get things out in the
open and clear them up sooner than later.
That's my general style, both in life and
my professional realm," she said, echoing
the ideals found in the Honor Code of confronting problems head on.
Rasmussen, who hails from Duke
University as the Director of Academic
Advising, and before that was Associate
Dean of the Duke's Trinity College ofArts
and Sciences, will officially begin her
tenure as dean on July L
"I am just really, really delighted I'm
going to be a part of Bryn Mawr," she
said.
She's particularly excited "about
working with people who clearly aren't
going to shy away from sharing their
opinions,", characterizing that boldness
as one of the "most exciting aspects of
joining this community."
President Jane McAuliffe said that
this passion for interacting with students
and respecting their opinions were some
of the qualities that made her select
Rasmussen from among the three finalists. She saw in Rasmussen "a way of
working well with students" while understanding the autonomy of the student
body and its self-governance.
Rasmussen said she plans to reach out
to student leaders as soon as possible and
likes the idea of working with the SelfGovernance Association.
"What's appealing about that is that
you identify issues of concern," she said.
"What I'm really looking forward to is
working collegially and side by side with
students about, 'OK, we have this issue or
we problem, how do we tackle it?' Not

that the dean is going to inject herself in
every discussion SGA has obviously, but
I hope there'll be some openness and willingness to let me listen in, advise and
consult as called upon."
SGA President Sophie Papavizas 'll

said she is looking forward to working
with Rasmussen, and hopes she can make
her transition to Bryn Mawr as smooth
as possible.
In addition to meeting student leaders,
Rasmussen is looking forward to working with Haverford's Dean Martha
Denney
and Swarthmore's newly
appointed dean, Elizabeth Braun.
"I think that is going to be a neat and
opportune chance for three relatively
new Deans to work together on solidify
and strengthening the bonds between the
three colleges, which are really very distinctive."
Denney joined Haverford this academic year, and Braun will be joining
Swarthmore next year
alongside
Rasmussen at Bryn Mawr.
Rasmussen has two main goals for her
first year.
"First and foremost, I want to get as
much understanding of the Bryn Mawr
campus, community and culture as possible. I think the best way to do that is to
talk to everybody I can," she said.
Secondly, she'd like to study Bryn
Mawr's difficulties with retention and
develop a plan to keep more students at
Bryn Mawr for four years.
"That's something I can start working
on pretty quickly,
identifying the patterns that might be for the students who
decide not to continue at Bryn Mawr."
As excited as Rasmussen is to come to
Bryn Mawr, she expressed some sadness
about leaving Duke
where she works,
lives in a dorm, and received her doctorate in primatology.
"It's always hard to leave a place you
come to see as home, and in my case,
Duke is literally home because I live on

campus in a residence hall," she said.
"The nature of any profession, and
that includes higher education, is that
you can only improve and expand by
moving on, and I think for me this was
the right time to move on. As sad as I will
be to say goodbye to Duke, I know this is

an amazing opportunity that lies ahead of
me."

Rasmussen's appointment marks the
end of a search that began last semester,
after Dean Karen Tidmarsh announced
she would be retiring from her current
position at the end of the school year.
In the two weeks leading up to spring
break,
including
three
finalists
Rasmussen, visited campus and met with
students, faculty, and staff. The search
committee convened to review the feedback gathered through online surveys
completed by those who-met with candidates.
The committee got an inside look at
the candidates as well. Committee members Ellie Canigula 'll and Hannah Davis
'lO spoke with students at each of the
finalists' home institutions.
"The impression we got... is that they
really love her. They were really inspired
by her," Davis said.
Canigula said that the committee put
emphasis on the feedback from the surveys.
"We spent hours looking at the feed-

"It's really tragic because when the
National Guard comes back, they have no
support," she said. "I heard a story from a
girl who saw her best friends killed in battle, and then returned to her hometown
and her friends were talking about
American Idol. She said 'How could we
even start to connect again?'
Linder said that the "Eyes Wide Open"
exhibit was very moving because it recognized the anniversary of the war without
bringing up political debates.
"There is a very real human cost to the
war," he said. "Bringing 'Eyes Wide Open'
helps illustrate that."
In conjunction with the "Eyes Wide
Open" exhibit, Swarthmore's SDS also
sponsored a lecture by Lakey titled
"Military Industrial Complex and the
United States Military Presence in
"

Afghanistan."
Lakey said

that President Barack
Obama has broken promises he made earlier in his campaign. "Although we have
the Obama Administration and the promise of 'change,' we have a similar policy to
the Bush Administration when it comes to

Iraq and Afghanistan," Lakey said.
Lakey was casual about both his topic
and his lecture style. Instead of standing
behind a podium, Lakey spoke for about
two hours to a group of 14 students sitting

back from the community into account,"
she said in an e-mail.
The committee then delivered an
unranked list of the candidates' strengths
and weakness to the President, who made
the final decision.
McAuliffe had a difficult time making
her decision.
McAuliffe said, "It was the toughest
choice that I've made in any search in my
professional life because they were three
really good candidates."
The president described the need to
choose the strongest candidate with her
desire to make the waiting period as
short as possible for the candidates.
"I was trying to move quickly because,
for somebody who is a candidate in
search, the longest period in your life is
between the time you spend on campus
and [receiving the phone call]... I've been
a candidate; I know what it's like to be
waiting for that phone call
[but] my
biggest concern was making the right
choice..." she said.
In the end, McAuliffe felt Rasmussen
was the right fit for Bryn Mawr.
"It was her energy, her experience,
her vision, her clear engagement [that...]
rang true to me," she said. "I just had a
strong sense that she would be a terrific
success."

I really feel the committee took the feed-

in a circle of sofas. Instead of focusing primarily on the details of the Iraq War, Lakey

discussed social activism in a more theoretical style.
Lakey discussed a variety of issues,
from the health care bill passed Sunday
night to the Vietnam War, in order to
express a philosophy of rational radicalism. "I hope this evening will create more
spaqe for new kinds of strategies," Lakey
said. "What I find among liberals more and
more is a knee-jerk reaction that moderate
is better than radical."
George Lakey argued that taking a moderate stance in social activism is not
always practical. Rather, Lakey said that
excluding radicals from social activism is a
dire mistake since it excludes the most
committed activists.
Lakey worried that as more activists
feel pressure to become moderate, truthful
debate diminishes. Lakey said, "Another
reason we need to diminish this chokehold
of realists on liberal activism is that it
reduces the amount of intellectual discourse
the discourse about Vietnam [in
the 1960's] was very juicy. I would love this
environment to get more juicy."
Lakey's conversational lecture lasted
over two hours, as most students attending
remained to discuss social activist strategies. Lakey was ecstatic about the enthusiasm of the attendants. "Now this is juicy,"
he said.

Auction hopes to foster education, community
BY QUITTERIE GOUNOT

qgounotl@swarthmore.edu
As Swatties and self-described intellectuals, one way to show our appreciation for the educational opportunities
that we have is through helping others
realize their own potential. This Friday,
March 26, the Village Education Project
will hold its second annual auction in
order to raise money for this cause, the
Village Education Project (VEP) volunteers teach summer classes in rural
Ecuador and fund scholarships for children to be able to go to school.
Founded in 2005 by Swarthmore alum
Katie Chamblee 'O7, VEP is a non-profit
organization that aims to give children
in the villages surrounding Otavalo,
Ecuador a chance to attend secondary
school.
School tuition in this area typically
amounts to around $2OO a year and students' families also face many related
expenses such as transportation and
book and uniform costs. For students
who have to take on many responsibilities at a young age like working for pay,

doing house chores or taking care of

younger siblings, doing well

in school

can be a challenge.
Volunteers from colleges across the
Swarthmore,
country,
including
Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania
and others, travel to Ecuador to teach
classes in English, mathematics and
computer science. At the end of the summer, the organization awards scholarships to all of the students who have
achieved high overall scores, along with
other factors like student effort and family situation.
"We give everyone who made [the
grade cut] scholarships, regardless of
money," Jean Strout 'lO said. "We find
the money somehow but we give them
what we promised."
VEP also organized an auction last
year. "This is the second year we've
done this and I'm glad it's becoming a
Swarthmore tradition," Zack Wiener 'l2
said. The concept is gaining ground.

Short pieces of theater
inspire surreal wonder
BY JOHN OH
joh2@swarthmore.edu
For Kari Olmon 'l3, Adam Rosenberg
'l3 and Nicholas Laßacuente 'lO, the
weekend was a success. For the One-Act
Play Festival this semester, the duo of
Olmon and Rosenberg directed "The
Sandbox" by Edward Albee, and
Laßacuente directed "Leftovers," written by Susanna Pretzer 'l2.
Each team specifically chose a play of
their liking and shaped it to their tastes.
Not only did they have to polish an entire
act, they faced a shortage of time as well.
"We had about two weeks to pull the
show together with spring break in the
middle and rehearsed twice a week for
about an hour and a half each rehearsal
session," Olmon said. "Operat[ing] under
such severe time restrictions, we had to
work very hard to present a polished production."
Set along a beach, "The Sandbox" features an imposing Mommy, a rich Daddy,
a decrepit Grandmother and a Young
Man. The peculiarity in this play was
that all the characters were very much
aware of their existence as actors in a
play, occasionally questioning the timing
of the tech lights and even talking with
the audience.
The play, as outwardly absurd as it
may seem, is inwardly about symbolic
awareness. Albee wanted to relay the
obsession with role-playing that he saw
in society. Another theme concerned the
cold and callous disposal of the elderly, a
reference Albee made to his own grandmother.
"Leftovers" is set in an empty house,
with a couple having dinner. However,
there is no food, but only a table with a

THE PHOENIX

phone and an eerie, ominous sense of
emptiness. It is evident that the couple
has been isolated from the rest of society
for a long time. The play revolves around
the phone, signifying the ambiguity of
the future. The couple continues to live

in isolation from the outside world,

mainly due to fear. Pretzer, who wrote
the play, recognized that people were

afraid of the unknown because it can
bring about changes that as could easily
be bad as good.
Spurts of laughter throughout the
play, moments of complete silence in
which viewers were deep in thought and
spine-rattling chills proved the success
of these plays. "The plays were strange,
but [l] liked how the props and additions
to the play added another level to the
act," Benjamin Kapilow 'l3 said.
"The most memorable part was probably the way the actors really took on
their characters. Kari and I had an established concept before we began
rehearsals, but our actors brought the
characters to new levels and explored
directions we hadn't even considered,"
Rosenberg said. "That sort of collaboration made therehearsal process dynamic
and exciting."
The One-Act plays showcased the
myriad of performing and directing talents that Swarthmore students possess.
Both "The Sandbox" and "Leftovers"
drew a crowd of friends, acquaintances
and play-enthusiasts who all joined in
the directors' and actors' accomplishments. One-Act Play Festival occurs biannually, once every semester.

Khoury explained, "This song was probably more than an hour long," which he
said is common in Arabic music.
Khoury also spoke about the use of
heterophony in Arabic music, where
the different musicians vary a single
melodic line by ornamenting over that
line. "It is somewhat a chaos but the
chaos is organized," Khoury said. "It'
moves in one direction."
There is traditionally no harmony in
classical Arabic music and the heterophony creates variation and intricacy. "Without harmonies you only have

and a symposium held on March 20
called "Artists in Wartime: Bearing

of the abuses of the xrurrent war in Iraq.
At the very core of Heyman's works
is the condition of the Iraqi, particularly

Heyman's critique of contemporary culture and politics in a powerful manner,

American abuses overseas as
American soil.
Furthermore, what one may find
striking about the layout of the exhibit
is the huge wall that separates the space
outside of the exhibit and the space
inside. The wall helps audiences to focus
by blinding them to the world outside
from which they came.
"I hope it will force people to pause
and recognize a special space," Heyman
said.
Viewers of the exhibit must enter the
exhibit with a clear mind so that they
may give each portrait the attention it
needs without outside distractions. By
doing so, one can fully experience the
tragedy and irony within each portrait.
The exhibit is a Cooper Series-sponsored event, a part of Philagrafika 2010,
and is conjoint with the exhibit
"Printmakers Go to War" at McCabe
Library. "Printmakers Go to War" will
continue through April 9 while "Bearing

head, as if to express the oneness of the

Heyman copied down as he painted.
Each story and portrait imbues a
stunning reality that is at once striking
and personal. "To walk by one portrait,
you're walking by .someone's story,

the portraits do encapsulate the experiences of each victim in a manner that
highlights how human and fragile each
victim is,- so that we as viewers feel
empathy for them.

exhibit is how it portrays the extent to

Swat Style Snapshot
Name: Robin Wagner-Pacifici
Title: Gil and Frank Mustin Professor of
Acting Chair
From: Penn Valley, PA
Current Residence: Swarthmore
What She's

Sociology,

Wearing:

"Actually all ofthese clothes were bought at one of my
favorite stores in Philadelphia, an extravagantly expensive store," Wagner-Pacifici said. "It's called Addresse.
They have just the most beautiful clothes." Her charcoal
sweater and ruffled top are Leisdottir. Wagner-Pacifici's
pants are by Lela Rose. Her nude-colored shoes are

Stuart Weitzman.

Though Wagner-Pacifici stuck to a neutral palette
with her outfit, it is obvious in the details of her clothes
that she likes eclectic, unique pieces. Both her top and
sweater are Leifsdottir, a Finnish brand that generates
interesting blouses, dresses and skirts with a cool,
Scandinavian edge. Her sweater has sleeves with a ruffled, eyelet attache, along with an eyelet lining at the bottom. Wagner-Pacifici continues the ruffled theme in her
gray blouse, adding more flounce and texture to the outfit. Her wide-legged pants are slightly reminiscent of the
tailored, streamlined pants seen in Fall 2010 collections,
like Derek Lam's.

How She Describes Her Style:
"I'm hopeful that it is kind of [a] contemporary classical kind of mix," Wagner-Pacifici said. "I don't tend to
wear anything very extravagant or outrageous." She
sticks to mainly muted, neutral colors, but looks for how
the clothes are cut. "I'm sort of conscious of line and
things made well," she said.
Wagner-Pacifici also wears classic items that will last
forever. "When I buy something, I anticipate that I will
be wearing it for at least 20 years," she said. "I do actually have many things that I'm still wearing that I bought
back in the 'Bos."
Fashion Influences & Inspirations:
While Wagner-Pacifici was in graduate school, she
took a leave of absence to live in Italy with her husband,
a biologist who was doing his post-doc work at the
University of Rome. It was in Italy, with its exquisitely
dressed men and women, where Wagner-Pacifici found
inspiration for how she dresses. She would visit her husband at the laboratory, where a few of his colleagues
were women. "What was astonishing to me was [when]

Wagner-Pacifici
stunned by how beautifully these

women dressed since her conception
of scholarly fashion was that it was
nonexistent. Also, these women were
working in a man's world profession
during the '7os. "They didn't see [theninterest in fashion] as compromising
their intellect or their professional
seriousness," she said. Wagner-Pacifici
considered this experience to be a kind
of "touchstone" for her look and then
started honing in on her own style by
adding European accents.

Where She Shops:
Besides shopping

at Addresse,
Wagner-Pacifici enjoys browsing through
Joan Shepp in Philadelphia. "They have a
lot of international designers. Some of

them are pretty radical and wild Dutch
designers," Wagner-Pacifici said.
She ajip shops occasionally at Max

"I'm against casual dressing for work,"
Wagner-Pacifici said quite vehemently. "I think
I have a strong sense of responsibility to my students." She feels that the classroom is "not just
an intellectual experience but an aesthetic experience, too."
Wagner-Pacifici feel! that it is her duty to look
presentable to students by putting extra time into
what she wears. "For betteror for worse, [students have]
got to look at me for three hours, so I want to mix it up a
little," she said.

Grief, blues and history course through poetry
BY DINA ZINGARO

dzingarl@swarthmore.edu

Renowned poet and current Emory professor
Kevin Young graced the Swarthmore community
with his presence on the evening of Mar. 22. Through
his poetry, Young effortlessly captures the nature of
loss and the progression of grief.
Young explained that poetry is "about finding our
way and finding the words to say sometimes difficult
things, sometimes funny things, finding the music to
say what is all around us." When asked to explain
the importance of poetry, the poet quoted the recently passed Lucille Clifton: "It's about what it means to
be human."
Assistant Professor of the English Department
Anthony Foy introduced the poet. "It might be too
easy to trumpet Kevin Young or his prodigious
accomplishments
his great accolades
his prestigious awards," Foy said. "[Young] sings songs, many
of which memorialize legacies and losses, both private and public, both personal and collective."
Indeed, Young boasts a vast collection of accomplishments, such as being a two-time winner of the
Pattern Poetry Prize, and a finalist for the National
Book Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Award
for Jelly Roll. The United States Artists just recently
granted Young a James Baldwin Fellow Award in
...

...

2009.
Young published his first volume of poems "Most
Way Home" in 1995, followed by an additional five

volumes. He has also edited five different anthologies of poetry, including "The Art of Losing: Poems
of Grief and Healing," which was released this past
month and from which Young performed many
poems.

Young explained that he writes a lot about "music
and history and heartache" and that there are "some
blues coursing through [his] work." At the reading,
Young performed poems from his latest book entitled

"Dear Darkness," including "Farm Team," "Slow

Drag Blues," "Flash Flood Blues" and "Black Cat

Blues." There are also traces of an older, countrywestern style in the book, which derives much of its
inspiration from the blues.
The audience laughed as Young shared various
perspectives on the blues. "Blues ain't nothing but a
poor man's heart disease. Blues ain't nothing but a
good man feeling bad. Blues ain't nothing but a bad
woman feeling good," Young said.
Young describes his newest poetry anthology
"The Art of Losing" as "contemporary elegies" about
grief and healing. "The book is about healing too,
which is a word I like better than closure, which
really isn't what happens with grief," Young said.
"[Grief] is a journey of sorts."
Young expressed that "The Art of Losing" is "the
book that [he] wished [he] had when [his] father
passed away." He had read W.H. Auden's "Funeral
Blues," which was read at his father's funeral.
"It's perhaps thought of as bleak, but in a way I
think of it as a modern elegy in that it's facing the
thing head on
it's seeking to transcend it just
through the naming," Young said.
The audience was privileged to hear a few of
Young's newest poems, including "Rue" and then
"Remedy," which was written in honor of Lucille
Clifton. Clifton had selected Young's first volume
"Most Way Home" for the National Poetry Series. "I
wouldn't be here without her," Young said. Later,
Young performed another new poem entitled
"Crowning," which is a poem about the birth of his
son. "He was 9 pounds 7 ounces, so my wife is the
real hero of this poem," Young said jokingly.
Young writes movingly about food in his poems in
"Dear Darkness," among the first ones he wrote after
the passing of his father. "Where I'm from, when you
have a funeral, we eat. It's a way of fellowship and
sustenance," Young said.
Professor Nathalie Anderson, who invited Young,
originally heard him read at a poetry festival in
South Carolina and explained that she "found [herself] drooling over his odes to Southern foods," such
as "Ode to Grits," "Ode to Boudin" and other food
...

poems.

Young also performed the memorable "Ode to
Okra." He explained that in a family originally from

Staff Editorial

Sweeping health care reform
a crucial step for social justice
On Tuesday, President Barack Obama
signed intolaw health care legislation that
is the most sweeping reform of America's
social fabric since the 19605. After almost
40 years of debate that started with

President Nixon's proposed health care
overhaul in 1974, most Americans will
finally be covered by adequate health
insurance, making this a truly historic

moment.

Barack Obama's landslide election in
the 2008 presidential race was greatly
aided by younger Americans. The vast
majority of health care spending, however, is to treat elderly Americans, who are
more likely to suffer from disease due to
old age. As a result, the President's signature initiative, which has now become the
law of the land, is not one that resonates
especially strongly with young people
such as college students.
Yet while health care reform might not
lie at the heart of students' concerns, they
too will be affected by the landmark legislation. First and most importantly, young
people who claim dependency on their
parents will be able to receive coverage
under their parents' health insurance
until the age of 26 at no extra cost to their
parents. This requirement will be of
tremendous help to those in college, who
often have enough financial worries aside
from health insurance by virtue of having
to pay for college tuition and related
expenses.

Second, starting in 2014, most
Americans, including virtually all college
students, will be required to have health
insurance at all times or to pay a fine.
Swarthmore students already have health
insurance, because the college wisely
requires them to obtain it prior to enrollment. There are young people, however,
including recent college graduates, to
whom being required to purchase insur-

ance seems a burden.
This burden is a necessary one because
older and sicker Americans in the health
insurance market suffer from adverse
selection. When one is young and healthy,
one might be better off financially by not
taking out health insurance and instead
paying for one's health expenses out of
pocket, because expenses for young and
healthy
people tend to be low.
Unfortunately, this creates a problem for
society: When the relatively healthier people do not take out insurance, health
insurance companies face a relatively
sicker pool of enrollees. This sicker pool of
people will incur higher costs on the company, causing the company to increase
premiums, which in turn prevents healthier, young people from being insured. For
this reason, while it may seem onerous to
some, the insurance mandate is an essential part of improving America's health
insurance market.
Beyond the effects on college students,
reform as enacted will have tremendous
positive effects on the country. Tens of millions of Americans will no longer suffer
from the inability to afford insurance
because they will receive federal subsidies
to do so. An ever larger number will no
longer face the barbaric practice of rescission of insurance when they become sick,
or the practice of denying coverage
because of the infamous "pre-existing con-

THE PHOENIX

ditions." At the same time, the govern-

ment is making the largest effort ever to
control the growth in the cost of health
care, which has gotten out of hand, illustrated neatly by the California insurance
company that raised premiums for most of
its enrollees by 39 percent in the past

month.
Less well-known aspects of reform, too,
might have a large impact. During the
final hours of debate in the House of
Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi
pointed to a problem that perhaps college
students not so much as their parents
might have experienced: job-lock. Millions
of Americans who are lucky to have a job
that provides health insurance for them
and perhaps for their family as well do not
currently have the freedom to change jobs
for fear of losing health insurance. In the
near future, health reform will remove
this impediment to job switching by providing Americans access to health insurance plans that will carry over from one
employer to another. And this is just one
of the many less-touted benefits of the
comprehensive reform bill.
As has been stressed by just about
everyone, the bill that was enacted, while
helpful in many ways, was less than ideal.
Despite expanding insurance to 32 million
people, it will leave millions of others
without health insurance. The bill also
fails to provide a government alternative
to the private health care industry, known
as a public option. Many have heavily
opposed such an option. Yet the government's largest insurance plan, Medicare,
which insures elderly Americans, is enormously popular among its beneficiaries.
We should not, however, in fretting
over the imperfections of the bill, prevent
ourselves from appreciating the magnitude of this accomplishment. A stronger
bill was politically impossible and would
have meant years if not decades of postponement on curbing the egregious practices of the health insurance industry.
One of the largest qualms that opponents of reform have voiced is that reform
on
substantially
increases taxes
Americans who earn more than $250,000
per year. While we recognize the severity
of this implication, as their human equals
we believe the people who work under the
people in the $250,000 tax bracket should
be entitled to the same health care benefits. Moreover, inequality has been on the
rise since the Reagan era and these taxes
are a laudable attempt to curb this disturbing trend.
We are convinced that health care
reform as signed into law by President
Obama is a major step forward for
America, one that strikes a blow against
social inequality. It brings us closer to the
goal of universal, high-quality medical
care for all Americans. We also realize
that many Americans are skeptical about
reform, or outright oppose it. But even opponents of reform must stand still at this
historic moment: An additional 32 million
Americans are projected to gain health
insurance in the coming years, while millions more will find their insurance more
affordable and more reliable. Support
reform or not, Vice President Joe Biden
was right in his verbal slip-up at the signing of the bill: "This is a big fucking deal."

Choosing local food benefits health and economy

said.
After struggling at the plate over spring break, Coach
Renee Clark, in her eighth season with Swarthmore,
urged the team to be more aggressive at the plate. The
results have shown clearly as Swarthmore has averaged
just under seven runs per game since the return from
their spring trip to North Carolina.
Scheirer has been very impressed by the ability of
her young team to overcome injuries and to play at a
high level through this point in the season. "The team
has definitely been dealing with the adversity of injured
teammates very well. We hit and pitched to win at Penn
State Berks, despite several starters being injured
Communication has a lot to do with it."
Communication has been incredibly important in
part due to the relative youth of the Garnet. Not only
has the Garnet relied on the pitching of Isabel Sanchez
'l3 and Katherine Smayda 'l3, but at times, the team has
played with an entire first-year infield. "They know it is
time to stand up, and I am so proud of how well they are
doing," said Scheirer. "We need to continue to communicate on the field about the outs, the situations, the
runners' speeds, and in the dugout, studying the other
team's defense, warning each other about pitches," she
said. If they continue to communicate, the players
believe that they can compete with anyone.

game over.
With only two games remaining before the start of
conference play, the Swarthmore softball team is playing their best ball of the year.
After dropping the first game of a double header on
Tuesday to Cabrini, the Garnet responded with an exciting 6-5 victory in game two as Scheirer connected on a
home run and helped to turn that 6-6-4 double play to
end the game.
That exciting victory comes on the heels of a strong
week for the Garnet as it went 4-2, sweeping PSU
Abington and PSU Berks even as they continue to play
without star Kathryn Riley 'lO.
Inspired by the play of the first-year class, patient
hitting and strong defense, the Garnet is confident heading into Centennial Conference competition.
Scheirer is batting over .450 on the season and has
become a feared hitter within the Garnet lineup. "I have
been working more on waiting for my pitch, as well as
identifying the pitch (fast, change, rise, drop, curve,

Smayda remarked on the process of adjusting from
high school level softball, saying "the biggest transition
is probably the higher expectations. Every girl on the
team has a lot to offer so you have to continually work
hard and improve to get playing time." Smayda continues to look more comfortable on the mound with every
outing and to work hard to develop as a collegiate pitcher. "I've just tried to work hard and improve as much as
possible. As a whole, I think all of the pitchers have
done a good job filling in while Katherine Riley has been
hurt. She is a great pitcher so we are each trying to do
what we can to step up when the team needs us."
It was Sanchez on the mound on Tuesday in game
two of the doubleheader. Swarthmore jumped out to an
early 4-0 lead before striking again with Scheirer's solo
home run in the fifth inning. The first-years went to
work next, with Allie Coleman 'l3 and Katie Teleky 'l3
smacking singles in front of a Smayda double down the
left-field line to put the Garnet ahead 6-0.
Though Cabrini made the game close, Swarthmore
was able to hold on to improve to 7-9 on the year.
Swarthmore has now won five out of eight games after

Florida Marlins
88-74
New York Mets
83-79 .
Atlanta Braves
79-83
Washington Nationals 68-94
Here, in a nutshell, is the extent of the
disparity in the National League: The
Philadelphia Phillies have improved marginally from 2009, if they've gotten better at

18

point, the Cubs have had too many "franchise mainstays" succumb to injuries
(Alfonso Soriano), an increased level of
competition (Kosuke Fukudome) or suspensions from hitting Gatorade machines
(Carlos Zambrano). Cincinnati is once
again being labeled a "dark horse" playoff
contender because of all of the "exciting"

all. Halladay for Lee is essentially a wash in
terms of the value it adds to the team;
Placido for Polanco is a decent upgrade at

third base, but shouldn't be worth much
more than an extra win; and the status of
their closer, the team's biggest weakness in
'O9, is uncertain going into Opening Day.
Despite this, there is no line of reason-

ing that wouldn't lead to the conclusion
that the Phillies should be the overwhelm-

ing favorites to return to the World Series
for the third straight year. The talent
across the board is simply too great, and
the fact that they are not playing in a particularly strong division should only make
it easier. Finishing in what I predict to be a
fairly distant second place will be Florida,
who got there last year on inexperienced
talent and should do so again. Pitchingwise, after Josh Johnson (one of the better
young pitchers in the league), the talent
just isn't there to be the best second-place
team in the league ... yet. Most people are
down on the Mets, and I'm certainly not
expecting them to contend with the
Phillies, but they still have enough good
players to warrant an over-.500 finish.
Likewise, most of the people who are down
on the Mets are suspiciously high on the
Braves. The talent on offense is there, to be
sure, but the losses of Javier Vazquez and
their two best relievers (not to mention that
they only won 86 games last year with all
three of those pitchers) weakens Atlanta far
more than additions like Jason Heyward,
Troy Glaus and Melky Cabrera will help
them. As for Washington
um

call up Stephen Strasburg he should be
fun to watch and that's it.
...

...

,

young talent they have on the way. Their
offense is serviceable, but predictions for a
successful season are all predicated on the
success of Cuban import Aroldis Chapman.
Based on the results of his spring training
outings, Reds fans who haven't seen a playoff game since 1995 can be excused for getting excited. As far as 2010 is concerned,
however, Chapman can't be expected to
contribute enough to boost an otherwise
mediocre pitching staff to the next level.
Only Washington had worse pitching in the
National League last year than the
Milwaukee Brewers, and overpaying
Randy Wolf shouldn't bump up that ranking more than a few places. The Astros, perpetually refusing to sacrifice the present for
the future, will instead be bad both today

breaks fell their way, would even conceivably beat St. Louis this season? At this

starter who throws the hardest fastball in
the majors isn't Justin Verlander or Josh
Beckett, but rather a 26-year-old Dominican
righthander named Übaldo Jimenez? Why

don't you know his name? Because he plays
in Colorado, a place where pitchers go to

die. (Or, in Mike Hampton's case, to enjoy
the great "school system" the state has to
offer. The $l2l million-dollar contract he
received was just the icing on the cake.) At
any

rate, Jimenez is becoming a bona fide

ace for his team and headlining a group of
starters whose talent has thus far outstripped their fame (once again, Colorado,
die, school system). The offense will be
among the league's best once again (first in
OPS in 2009). Factor in a likely Dodger
drop-off, and the Rockies have their first-

ever division title.

As for the Dodgers, if you had to pick

one manager to help tune out distractions
caused by ownership and keep his team
focused, Joe Torre would probably be drafted first overall. What is troubling, however,
is the overall lack of improvement and
potential decline in a few areas (rotation,
second base) that should do enough to close
the small gap that existed between themselves and Colorado. Los Angeles could
very well keep the division crown, but it
looks like they're falling just when
Colorado is on the rise.
The Giants were a decent team last year,
and acquired some badly needed offense
over the winter. However, they have
pitched at such a high level over the past
few years that a drop-off seems inevitable,

and despite additions like Mark Deßosa
and Aubrey Huff, no one will confuse their
lineup with the Phillies'. They overachieved in 2009, and are due for a small
step backward. Talking heads seem
strangely bullish on the Diamondbacks,
who fit both the "surplus of exciting young
players" and "returning ace poised to make
a comeback" bills. Personally, I think some
of those "exciting young players" might
require another year of seasoning, and
there's no guarantee Webb is the same
pitcher (in fact, it's unlikely). The future is
not exactly bleak for the Diamondbacks,
but 2010 won't be the year it all comes
together. In last place will be San Diego,
who are an even better example of NL West
obscurity (two Padres who aren't Adrian
Gonzalez, anyone? Take all night if you
want to). 74 wins is conservative, and if
Gonzo gets traded, no floor is too low.

the hardest
thing in sports isn't sinking a pressure

bracket. Whoever thought that death and
taxes were the only things that are certain
in this world has clearly never seen an
NCAA Tournament game because losing a
Final Four team on an absurd play is just
as much of a lock. Last year it was
Villanova's Scottie Reynolds crushing the
hearts of Pitt supporters worldwide and
this year it was Ali Farokhmanesh and
Northern lowa downing Kansas.
I've literally tried everything to put
together a good bracket. Well, everything
except what you're about to read. I've done
hours of research, I've watched games, I've
gone only off of gut picks. I've copied
"Sports Illustrated", I've listened to the
experts, I've done the exact opposite of the
experts and it all results in one thing:
stinky bracket. This year I've had enough.
I'm turning to a strategy I should have
implemented a long time ago, something I
can't do on my own. I had to call in the help
of a true expert...
This year every single ESPN analyst
had Kansas in the Final Four. Jay Bilas,

any "expert" and I'll show you their stinky

Northern lowa was and how "when the

some luckless team is going to draw a midmajor opponent that poses high-major
problems. It will draw Northern lowa,"

and that "Northern lowa belongs
team is going to find out the hard way."
Then guess what he did: he picked Kansas.
I'm done with the experts; I'd even go so far
as to say that the more youknow about college basketball the worse you are at picking brackets. Since I'm a college basketball
player and even though I don't watch a
heavy amount of basketball (besides from
the bench), years of watching SportsCenter
and being around people who are obsessed
has given me enough exposure to completely corrupt my bracket-picking abilities. Knowledge equals stupidity come
tournament time, which is why I found
someone who is completely pure, someone
who has never even watched an entire basketball game in her life, someone who
when asked to describe how much she
knows about basketball said, "My
boyfriend used to play basketball at
Swarthmore and he's short so when he told
me that he played I was confused at first
because I thought basketball players were
really tall.
"Then I remembered from Space Jam

THE PHOENIX

College's own Tayarisha Poe.
Tayarisha is a sophomore film major
whose interests include watching movies,
making movies, being in movies and talking about movies, and whose interests
refreshingly do not include watching basketball, playing basketball or talking about
basketball. The task I gave Tayarisha was
very simple, to fill out a bracket from the
Sweet 16 onward, predicting the games

until the end of the tournament. Just for

kicks, I posed the same task to a basketball
"expert," since I couldn't find picks online
from any of ESPN's frauds that weren't
already marred by their horrendous pretournament picks. Our resident expert is
Chad Songy and he will be going up
against Tayarisha in a predict-off to determine once and for all whether it's better to
be oblivious or informed when it comes to
picking tournament games.
Chad was a point guard at the Division
111 level for Millsaps College in Jackson,
Mississippi, finishing his illustrious
career with 296 assists and a 2.77 assist to
turnover ratio. In his senior season he was
nominated for the Bob Cousy award, given
to the best male point guard in the nation
across all divisions, along with being
awarded conference player of the year in
the SCAC. He now works full time as a
director and clinician for the highly
acclaimed Point Guard College. Chad has
been closely watching and analyzing
approximately 16 hours of Division I
NCAA men's basketball per week since the
November. My money is on Tayarisha, but
that's besides the point. Let's get to the
picks!

Elite 8

#9 Northern lowa vs. #5 Michigan
State:
Tayarisha Poe says Northern lowa
"because there's nothing else to do in lowa
besides sports."
Chad Songy says Michigan State
"because of experience and coaching."
Chad believes Mich. St. will prevail in a
close matchup, but he wishes star point
guard Kalin Lucas were playing;
Tayarisha doesn't know who Kalin Lucas
is.
#2 Ohio State vs. #6 Tennessee:
TP says Ohio State. "Ohio State has a
shorter name, I went with if because
[Ohio] was shorter."
CS says Ohio State because of its

they have a good team."
CS says Kentucky because Jay Bilas
picked Cornell.
(I wholeheartedly agree with Chad's
reasoning here, which is why I'm going

with

Cornell: because

Chad picked

Kentucky.)

#ll Washington vs. #2 West Virginia:
TP says Washington for literally no rea-

son.
CS says West Virginia because their
defense is ridiculous and he says they've
proven that they can win close games.
#1 Duke vs. #4 Purdue:
TP says Duke. "I think they're good at
sports stuff. Are they an Irish school, like
Irish Catholic? No, wait, that's Notre
Dame. Wait, didn't they have that thing
with the stripper and the lacrosse guys and
they beat her up or something like that so
their athletes are clearly very fierce."
CS says Duke because Purdue is shorthanded without star player Robbie

Hummel.

(Again, the name Robbie Hummel
means absolutely nothing to Tayarisha,
but that's why her picks are the truth,
baby!)
#3 Baylor vs. #lO St. Mary's:
TP says, "St. Mary's, because they have
a saint in their name so they have the help
of God, I guess."
CS says, "Baylor is going to kill St.
Mary's."

Final 4 (The matchups are slightly different here, so I'm just going to list each person's winners and their reasoning.)
TP says Ohio State over Northern lowa,
(because again, Ohio is shorter), Syracuse
over Kansas State (again, because she's
heard of Syracuse), Cornell over
Washington (because she's never heard of
Washington) and Duke over St. Mary's (no
apparent reason).
CS says Ohio State will prevail over
Michigan State (because ofLucas's injury),
Kansas State over Butler (again, athleticism and discipline), West Virginia over
Kentucky (because WV is a team that can
match Kentucky's athleticism and plays

a lot harder on defense; he thinks this will
be a great game) and Duke over Baylor.
Championship

TP says, "Ohio State over Syracuse,
because it's a state school and I don't think
Syracuse is a state school. Maybe it is. I'm
not actually sure where Syracuse is. It's in
New York, isn't it?" She also picks Duke
over Cornell because "they always said in
high school that Cornell was the easiest
Ivy League school to get into because when
kids go there they get really stressed out
and jump off of that high cliff and commit
suicide, so I figure at Duke they do less
work so they have more time for sports."
CS says Kansas State over Ohio State
and Duke over West Virginia, flipping the
script from his original bracket here.
"Scheyer will have a coming out party during the final four; Duke's guard play,
coaching, and experience will be too much
to handle for WV."

CHAMP
TP says, "Ohio State over Duke,
because Ohio is a state school and I still
just think state schools are probably better
at athletics." I'm not sure what she would
have picked if Ohio State had a cliff (or
bridge) to jump off of; luckily, there are no
tall buildings in Ohio outside of Cleveland.
CS says Duke over Kansas State, He
predicts that Duke will win by nine (this
was very bold). Chad says games are either
won by two or three, eight or nine, or 15 or
16. He thinks this game is going to be close
and because it's the championship, when
Kansas State realizes they're going to lose
they're going to start fouling and Duke is
going to hit their free throws. "It's going to
be a close game throughout but Duke will
,pull away at the end because of the intentional fouling."
Okay, so there you have it folks. Let's
see how they do. Like I said earlier, my
money is on Tayarisha because at this
point I'm convinced that the less you
Cornell to
know, the better off you are

GARNET ATHLETE OF THE WEEK

greater level of talent.

#1 Syracuse vs. #5 Butler:
JP says Syracuse "because I've heard
of Syracuse and I don'tknow Butler."
CS says Butler. It's against his intuition, but he is going with Butler because
their starting point guard is a two-time
graduate of Point Guard College, and he
thinks they'll find a way to win.

Melissa Emmerson
JR,, SOFTBALL, RINGWOOD, NJ.

WHAT SHE'S DONE:
Emmerson helped the Garnet defeat Perm
State-Berks this past Saturday, scoring three
runs and knocking in a team-high five RBls off
four hits for the sweep. Down 3-0 in the fifth
inning of the first game, Emmerson hit a twoRBI, two-out single and later scored the tying
run. Her RBI double in the seventh allowed the
Garnet to take the lead and the game.

#6 Xavier vs. #2 Kansas State:
TP says Kansas State. "I felt like a state
school would have better sports than a
school I've never heard of."
CS says Kansas State because of their
sheer skill and athleticism. Also, he
believes that Kansas State is more disciplined than Xavier. Chad says in moments
of extreme pressure, players revert to their
dominant habits, where Kansas State has
the edge.
#1 Kentucky vs. #l2 Cornell:
TP says Cornell "because my friend is
going to transfer there from Wesleyan for
basketball and he's really good, so maybe

Men's lacrosse loses two
close conference games
BY MARCUS MELLO

mmello2@swarthmore.edu

After dropping two one-point games this
past week, the Garnet men's lacrosse team
now holds a 1-4 record. The Centennial
Conference opener against the Ursinus
College Bears (5-0, 1-0 CC) and the subsequent conference matchup against the
Dickinson College Red Devils (8-0, 1-0 CC)
both ended heartbreakingly with the former
game going into overtime.
The Garnet played rigorously against
Ursinus from the start of the game after traveling to Collegeville, PA on March 17. Max
Hubbard 'l2 put four of his five shots in the
back of the net for a career high game in
goals.

Hubbard said of his dominating performance, "I was excited for our first conference

game, but I don't think I played any differently than I normally do. You just have to
keep working hard, and sometimes your
shots fall." Aside from Hubbard, co-captain
Tyler Bradshaw 10 scored two while Wes
Marcik 13, off to a nice first-year start, added

Garnet and led the team with six ground
balls.
The home game against Dickinson
College (8-0,1-0 CC) on March 20 was another
close loss for Garnet and their second
straight in the conference. Facing the Red
Devils, who were ranked fifth in the
Centennial Conference preseason ranking,
the Garnet played aggressively and nearly
forced the game into overtime with under a
minute left.
After a Dickinson player fouled out of the
game, the Garnet tried to make the best of its
one-man advantage. With seconds left,
Musynske fired a long-range shot that was
inches away from pushing the game into
overtime. Musynske's shot struck the crossbar and ended the Garnet's hope of a comeback. "It was pretty upsetting seeing the
shot hit the post," Musynske said.
The Garnet played a tough first period,
giving themselves a 3-2 lead. Marcik continued his strong first-year start by hitting the
net the put the Garnet on the board. His goal
was followed by goals from Musynske and
attacker Zach Belden 'l2, who scored off an
assist from Bradshaw.
The Garnet extended their lead in the second period with Hubbard and Bradshaw
each firing successful shots. Leading 5-3 at
halftime, the Garnet fell apart in the next
period. At 7:17, the Red Devils' Chris Dodson
netted a goal and only twelve seconds later
the Devils scored again to tie the game. The
Devils scored again with a minute left in the
third period and continued their four-goal
streak into the fourth period. After their
two-point lead became a two-point deficit,
the Garnet had a surge of offensive aggressiveness with Bradshaw scoring an unassisted goal
his 10th of the season
and
Musynske launching a post-nailer, but it was
not enough to reverse Dickinson's scoring
run.
The Red Devils may have won the backand-forth game by keeping the ball for longer
stretches and winning the majority of the
face-offs (13/17). Dickinson also scooped
nearly twice as many ground balls than the
Garnet and fired 40 shots in comparison to
the Garnet's 24. Both teams committed
seven fouls.
In goal, Friedenberg continued his great
season with 15 saves. Bradshaw led the
offense with two goals and a pair of assists.
Hubbard attributes the loss to Dickinson
to not being able to hold onto the ball in the

one. Bradshaw currently leads the Garnet
offensively with ten goals.
Hubbard's offensive outbreak began with
two seconds left in the first period off an
assist from Bradshaw. Hubbard said that he
thought this goal was executed particularly
well. "Tyler Bradshaw gave me a great feed
cutting left on the crease for the first goal.
Off-ball movement is something Coach Gress
has emphasized a lot." Hubbard's goal put
the Garnet on top by a 2-1 score at the end of
the first period. The other Garnet goal came
from Bradshaw off an assist from co-captain
Gavin Musynske 10 about 13 minutes into
the game.
The Garnet started the second period
rather weakly as the Bears stole the lead by
netting three goals in less than five minutes.
With the Garnet down 2-4, the biggest deficit
in the game, midfielder John Bukawyn 'l2
provided an assist to Hubbard, who scored
his second goal with exactly eight minutes
remaining in the period. Marcik also connected on an unassisted goal.
Tied 4-4 going into halftime, the third and
fourth periods were also close. The Bears
scored two goals in the third period and the
Garnet scored one, but the Garnet fought
hard and reversed the action in the fourth
period holding the Bears to one goal while
scoring two.
Hubbard scored a goal in each period, third quarter. "It sounds obvious, but you
with Bradshaw netting a shot halfway
can't score if you don't have the ball, and
through the final period. Hubbard's goal, your defense gets tired if the other team has

First-year Garnet player Malik Mubeen lines up an overhead smash against his

Kalamazoo College opponent on Tuesday.
On a beautiful Saturday afternoon,
the Garnet women's tennis team earned
a victory over Centennial Conference
rival Gettysburg while the men's team
fell to the College of New Jersey Lions in
a tight loss.
The women, who took seven of the
nine matches this past weekend against
Gettsyburg, were successful in both
their singles and double matches.

Rosie Dußrin 12 helped lead the

Garnet to victory with her No. 1 singles
win (6-2, 6-2) and a doubles win (8-5)
against the Bullets. She partnered with
Luann Cignavitch 'll in the doubles
match.

Rachel Wall work 'lO and her partner

Emily Rosenblum 13 also successfully
defeated their Gettysburg counterparts
in the No. 1 doubles match (8-1).
In addition to Dußrin's singles victory, Rosenblum, Kelsey Johnson 13 and
Alexis Hickman 11 also contributed by
winning their singles matches.
The women's tennis team returns to
action on Saturday against McDaniel at
Ip.m.

The men, unfortunately, could not
match the Garnet women's success
against Gettysburg with a win against

to TCNJ's Steven Fernandez 4-6, 4-6, to
lose the match. Following Youngblood's
close defeat, Swarthmore's Nos. 2 to 4
singles players Zak Kelm 'l2, Mark Wee

Garnet fight back, winning their respective matches in straight sets. Both
Malik Mubeen 13, the No. 5 singles player for Swat, and Seth Udelson 13, the
No. 6 singles player for .Swat, however,
were unable to win their respective

matches.
The Lions were also able to win two
of the three double matches on
Saturday. Despite the win by No. 1 dou-
