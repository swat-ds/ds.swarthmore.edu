Students file lawsuit against Diebold
Sophomores claim fair use rights would exempt e-voting memos from copyright law
BY MATTHEW

The college "is deeply proud of its students' resolve to act
on behalf of an open and fair democracy," he said, "and
believes that the finest teaching of civic responsibility
encourages students to act on their commitment to a better society by first seeking approaches within the law to
reach socially significant goals, before considering civil

tions that include Harvard and the Massachusetts

FITTING

mfittinl@swarthmore.edu

Nelson Pavlosky 'O6 and Luke Smith 'O6 said Monday
that they would file lawsuit against voting
machine-maker Diebold, Inc., in a California federal
court. Their decision has moved them into a leading role
in a situation that has spread across college campuses
and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) nationwide.
In a mutual effort, the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, a non-profit legal group, and Stanford Law
School Center for Internet and Society will file suit jointly against Diebold on behalf of the two sophomores. The
suit will attempt to enjoin Diebold from claiming copyright infringement over more than 13,000 memos
obtained from a publicly accessible internal company
Web site and posted on the Web site of Why War?, a

Swarthmore student group.

The lawsuit claims the memos fall under fair use. This
would mean their circulation was not subject to existing
copyright laws, most notably the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (DMCA). If successful, the suit would stop
Diebold from sending any more takedown requests to
ISPs, such as Swarthmore's computer network, that hosted the memos. The suit claims that using such requests
without legal justification constitutes fraudulent behavior on Diebold's part.
Under safe harbor guidelines in the DMCA, Diebold
can issue takedown requests without any proof as to how
the materials in question constitute copyright infringement. If the ISP that receives the request wishes to
remain legally protected, it must immediately take down
the materials.
The voting machine-maker is responsible for
machines used by about 52 percent of polling places in
the United States.
The students, both members of the Swarthmore
Coalition for the Digital Commons, defined the issue as
one of rights. "We're not seeking monetary damages or
anything," Smith said. "We just want our free speech

back."
Since it sent a takedown request to Swarthmore two
weeks ago, the company has sent seven more to institu-

Institute of Technology.
The official lawsuit will go forward Nov. 17, until
which Diebold may send more takedown requests if it

wishes.

Dean of the College Bob Gross '62 praised the students' action. He said the college itself was trying to
question both Diebold's use of the DMCA and the claims
Diebold made in the takedown request it sent to
Swarthmore two weeks ago.
SCDC will launch a counter-notification in addition to
the lawsuit, Smith said. Such a notification would allow

disobedience."
Gross added that Swarthmore still held two conflicting priorities on the issue: to support students who

protest Diebold's actions and to protect itself legally.
"We would like to find a way to make sure that the
documents get appropriate circulation," he said.
Micah White 'O4, a member of Why War?, said that
group's involvement might soon decrease significantly.
Until this week, Why War? considered itself to be spearheading the movement to spread the memos. As of yesterday, however, 54 institutions of higher education and
one high school had users hosting the documents.
"I think we did our part," White said, referring to the
group's Web site, which has carried the memos for the
past several weeks and still does. "We activated 50 groups
at 50 colleges in 10 days, and that's a monumental accom-

plishment."
Diebold 14 days to offer proof that the memos do, in fact,
fall under existing copyright law and that their circulation is illegal. Otherwise, the ISP in question, in this case
Swarthmore's network, would legally be allowed to host
the memos.
Regarding the decision to file this suit specifically,
however, Smith said, "We needed to clear up all this
uncertainty. We needed to make it clear that we had the
right to do this [circulate the memos]."
In a statement released last Friday, the college said
encouraging students to question Diebold and its claims
was in keeping with its mission of imparting to students
a need for socially responsible citizenship. It also defended its decision to take down student users' machines that
provided links to Web sites that provide the memos, most
notably Why War?'s site. Citing a 1999 federal district
court ruling, the college said that case "suggested" that

providing such links "may be construed as contributory
copyright infringement."
President Al Bloom was also quoted in the statement.

White added that "attention should now be focused on
the legal."
Various groups at other institutions around the country, he said, have embraced the mission of spreading the
memos. They hope to form a separate organization, one
that would take the lead role of keeping available the
memos whose circulation Why War? initiated.
The memos will remain available on the group's Web
site, www.why-war.com. Though the group's server,
which is not associated with Swarthmore, received a
takedown request from Diebold in the past week, the
server did not take steps to remove the memos.
Instead, the server decided that, if the links on
www.why-war.com were to plain text documents rather
than other links to the memos, then it would be within
the bounds of the law. According to White, it plans to take
no further steps.
White also continued to dismiss the college's actions,

Theft suspect was injured in car accident
BY DEIRDRE CONNER
dconner2@swarthmore.edu

A man who may have been a suspect in
a string of thefts on campus this summer
was involved in a serious accident after he
fled from Public Safety officers.
The man, now identified as Donald L.
Rice Jr., 30, of the 1200 block of S. 23 Street
in Philadelphia, was Spotted on Aug. 14 by
staff, who described him as a person suspected of stealing credit cards and personal items from offices in Parrish, according
to a statement issued Tuesday by Director
of Public Safety Owen Redgrave.
When Public Safety officers tried to
stop Rice, he ran to his car, a Jeep Grand
Cherokee, which was parked on the upper
campus, according to reports. He hit two
cars as he drove out. Vice President
Maurice Eldridge said he believed Public
Safety officers attempted to follow the
man as he fled in order to record his
license plate number.
Around 2:45 p.m., Rice was traveling
north on Route 320 (Chester Road) and
turned left to go west on the Baltimore
Pike, according to reports from the
Swarthmore and Springfield police. He

THE PHOENIX

then ran a red light at the intersection of
the Baltimore Pike and the Springfield
Mall and hit another car. When his Jeep
hit the car and then the curb, it rolled over
three or four times, and Rice was ejected.
He was taken to Crozer-Chester Medical
Center, where he remained on a respirator
for at least a month.
Larry Schall, vice president for facilities and services, said the incident was
"not a chase." He declined to comment,

however, on whether the officers were following Rice.
Swarthmore and Springfield police
responded to the accident soon after,
Swarthmore Police Chief Brian Craig
said, where Public Saftey officers "were
the

first ones on the scene." When
responding to the call, "we were operating
on the presumption that it was a continuous event from the time the trespass started to the time the accident occurred," he

said.

Schall said the Public Safety officers
did not see the accident happen.
As of Sept. 15, Rice was on a respirator
and not responding to stimulus, according
to a Springfield Police Department report.
But, according to Crozer-Chester records,

he was discharged Oct. 30. Attempts to
contact Rice or any members of his family
Wednesday were

unsuccessful.

It is not known whether Rice was
responsible for the thefts, though they
have stopped except for one incident,

Schall said. Swarthmore police are still
investigating the case.
"We haven't received any information
for his legitimately being on college

grounds. The way he left indicates that he
certainly didn't think he did," Craig said.

The description issued last spring iden-

tified the suspect as a black male in his
mid- to late twenties, 5 feet 8 inches to 5
feet 11 inches, with a medium complexion,
a medium build, short hair and possible

facial hair.
See ACCIDENT, pg. 4

■--.^■j:.id:.id:f.]:jjii:iit^_-T^T^^^^^^M
On Tuesday, Owen Redgrave, director of Public Safety, issued the following
statement:

During the summer months of 2003 a number of office thefts occurred, primarily from Parrish Hall. A description of a possible suspect was developed after
interviewing a number of victims and other witnesses. On Aug. 14, 2003, Public
Safety responded to several reports from staff who believed this individual was
in the Parrish and Kohlbergarea.
The individual in question was located by a Public Safety Officer and asked to
stop. The suspect fled on foot and eventually entered a vehicle parked on the
upper campus. He was then observed striking two other vehicles in his attempt
to flee. A short time later it was learned this individual was involved in a vehicle
accident and as a result of the accident the suspect's identity was determined. It
has not yet been established, however, that he is responsible for the college's
thefts. Swarthmore Borough Police are investigating.

Four cited on Halloween
Students who signed party permit will not be fined
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX

ldremeal@swarthmore.edu

Four students were cited last Friday,
three of them for underage drinking.
The first citation took place on the 900
block of Strath Haven Ave., Swarthmore
Police Chief Brian Craig said. Sgt.
Raymond Stufflet, an officer on patrol, took
an 18-year-old sophomore student home
after citing the student for underage drink-

ing around 11:30 p.m.
Stufflet cited a 20-year-old junior student and a guest of the same age for underage drinking and public drunkenness at
12:15 a.m. at the intersection of Yale Ave.
and South Chester Rd., a block away from
Palmer, Pittenger and Roberts.
"That one was a little disconcerting, in
that we also observed one of the parties
staggering and almost falling into the road,
where cars were driving by," Craig said.
Those students' preliminary breath
tests revealed alcohol concentrations of 13
and J. 7 percent. Stufflet brought them home
asked Public Safety to meet them at their
dormitory out of concern for their safety.
The fourth citation was for disorderly
conduct and took place on the 900 block of

Harvard Ave. after 2 a.m. Stufflet had come
to Mary Lyon because a student had called
the police after locking himself out of his
car. While helping the student, the officer
saw a senior student, age 21, urinating publicly.

Dean of Student Life Tedd Goundie said
he "didn't see any action being taken" as a
result of the citations.
"We know we have this wildly popular
event once a year at ML, and we worry

about it. But, as far as making drastic
changes, I don't see it," he said.
"People are taking a risk if they're

drinking underage," Goundie added, "and
it's a lot more obvious risk if they're walk-

ing around in the town."
An underage drinking citation can result
in the loss of a driver license for six months,
Craig said. Defendants generally have the
opportunity to plead guilty, attend counseling and do community service, which can
reduce the offense to disorderly conduct.
Craig said one of the students cited at
Yale and South Chester had told Stufflet that
Party Associates had not been checking

identification at the door of the Halloween
party at Mary Lyon. When Stufflet returned
to Mary Lyon at 1:16 a.m. to meet Public
Safety in response to a noise complaint, he
told the two students who had signed the
party permit about the possible penalty for
not checking identification, which is a fine
of $l,OOO per person cited for underage
drinking. In this case, each permit signer
could have been fined $3,000 because three
students had been cited.
"Charges could have been filed, but
they're not going to be," Craig said.
Goundie said police were under pressure to keep students from exhibiting public drunkenness in residential areas to
avoid complaints from borough residents.
But, he added, "obviously, the police could
have done a lot more than they did do, so I
think they exercised restraint."
The police had last cited a student for
underage drinking earlier in the semester
as a result of a medical call, Goundie said.
Another student was arrested this semester for driving under the influence.

Students assault delivery man
BY DEIRDRE CONNER
dconner2@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore police plans to arrest two
people in the next week for assaulting an
Acapulco Pizza driver on campus.
One male suspect will face charges of
simple assault, criminal mischief and disorderly conduct, and a female student will
face charges of assisting simple assault,
Maginnis
Paltrolman
Joe
of
the
Swarthmore Police Department said.
Police will not release the names of the suspects until the arrests have been made.
On Oct. 25 at around 3 a.m., the driver
delivered a pizza to a man and two women
in Parrish, according to police reports. The
man paid for the pizza and included a tip,
but as the driver was returning to his car,
the man came back and demanded change,
police said. When the driver said he had

been told to keep it, the man hit him in the
face several times. The driver called 911,
and Swarthmore police and Public Safety
arrived minutes later.
The bill was $12.50, and the man gave
the driver $l6, the driver said. He was not
seriously injured, but was bleeding.
"It sounded like a stupid thing to get
involved with," Swarthmore Police Chief
Brian Craig said.
The attack surprised Acapulco workers,

who say they usually have a positive view
of Swarthmore students.
"I would not believe till that day that my
driver would have gotten hit so hard from a
Swat student," said one of Acapulco's owners, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing further harassment. "I cried
when I saw him, his glasses broken and his
face bleeding." The owner said the driver
now is faced with a $5O bill for a health
insurance deductible and $4OO to fix damage

Political dissenter to speak
BY BREE BANG-JENSEN
bbangjel@swarthmore.edu

When American troops entered Iraq in
February, Brady Kiesling '79 resigned from his
position as political counselor in the American
embassy in Greece, citing an inability to "reconcile my conscience with my ability to represent
the current U.S. administration."
Kiesling's letter to Secretary of State Colin
Powell was published in newspapers around the
world, and The New York Times called it "the
most eloquent statement of dissent thus far put
out regarding the issue in Iraq."
On Nov. 13, Kiesling will come to campus to
speak about his reasons for resignation, current
American foreign policy and his hopes for the
future.

Kiesling said he was not opposed to all U.S.
military involvements in other countries.
"The invasion of Afghanistan was politically
inevitable," Kiesling said. "I would have liked it
if diplomatic options were explored more thoroughly, but there

was tremendous pressure on

the president to do something large and presidential. I had no difficulty defending that decision to our partners around the world."
Kiesling also supported the first Gulf War. "In
the case of the first Gulf War, Saddam had violated a clear rule of international law: Don't invade
your neighbor. George Bush the elder very properly called him on it." He felt the first Gulf War
strengthened international law, placing the
United States in a strategically valuable position.
Iraq, however, was different.
"Every European I spoke to felt that Saddam
was deferable through ordinary means,"
Kiesling said. He deplored the high cost of the

war to the American people, as well as the lack of
evidence. "In the cause of optional war, standards of evidence must be considerably higher. I
concluded that we were not presenting evidence
because we didn't have it."

Kiesling did not agree that Iraq was a failed
state as he believed Afghanistan had been, and
he said he worried about the high costs of military occupation during the reformation of the
nation. "We were just going to have a miserable
time as an occupying power in Iraq. Every 14year-old with a hand grenade was going to

become an enemy. It could become like the West
Bank, and I didn't think we had the stomach for
that kind of action."

Since his resignation, Kiesling said, his colleagues have been "pretty cautious, but there
have been quiet signals of support." Kiesling is
working on a book that will talk about how "the
world is not as dangerous as we think. We should
stop being terrorized and listen to our own
ideals. By the way, we should get a new president." He hopes to publish his book in August,
before the election, in the hopes that it will influence people to vote against George W. Bush.
Before Kiesling's placement in Greece, he
worked in Tel Aviv and Casablanca, as well as at
the India and Romania desks in Washington,
D.C. Kiesling studied Greek at Swarthmore and
attended

the

University

of

Athens

and

University of California at Berkeley.
Kiesling said he had spent most of his time
"playing Dungeons and Dragons on top of
Parrish and learning to play pool" while at
Swarthmore and worried he had not make much
of an impact. He said he looked forward to
returning to campus to speak.
"The basic element of Swat that stuck with
me was that you do not allow yourself to be bullied intellectually," Kiesling said. "The most
important thing is to be brave enough to report

back to Washington how the real world actually
is. A number of ambassadors just take this cando, positive approach to keep their seat at the
table."
Kiesling will be speaking on Nov. 13 at 7 p.m.
in the LPAC Cinema. The lecture is sponsored by
the College Democrats and Alumni Relations.

Health activist speaks at Swat
BY BREE BANG-JENSEN
bbangiel@swarthmore.edu

When Jane Roberts first heard that
President George W. Bush had decided to
withdraw the United States' $34 million
pledge to the United Nations Population
Fund, she was furious. "In the middle of
the night, I thought 'By golly, there must
be 34 million people who would each be
willing to give a dollar.'
The next day, Roberts began the 34
Million Campaign. She sent a letter to her
local paper, urging people to give a dollar
"

to UNPFA. She spoke to family and
friends, writing, e-mailing and calling
everyone she knew.

Roberts's lecture on Monday focused
on grassroots movements and her role in
the 34 Million Campaign.
Roberts said she had traveled to Mali
and Senegal to see firsthand how the campaign funds were being used.
"More women die in childbirth over a
few days than people die from terrorism
in a whole year," Roberts said.
She opened her talk Monday night by
showing the assembled students the kits
passed out in developing nations to pro-

mote a sterile birth and reduce risk of
infection and infant mortality. They consisted of simple materials such as a sterile plastic sheet, soap, a razor to cut the
umbilical cord, and string with which to

tie it.
Since Roberts founded the 34 Million

Campaign 14 months ago, she has raised
over $1.5 million to replace the United
States' pledge.
UNPFA promotes reproductive healthcare education and access. Roberts
believes the real reason behind American
refusal to support the fund lies in Bush's
desire to "please his radical right and
anti-UN supporters." Throughout the
presentation, she emphasized the necessity of population control.
Rotaract sponsored the lecture-as the
beginning of a series focused on bringing
prominent individuals in public policy to
campus.
Rotaract President Doru Gavril 'O5
said these lectures would "present a different type of activism. Swarthmore students are somewhat skewed to protesting
and picketing buildings for two hours,
then going back. That's good, and it has
its place, but it is not enough." These lectures will highlight grassroots activists
like Roberts as well as members of
The organizers were not worried by
the small turnout, citing last-minute
advertising as the probable cause.
Students who did attend were enthusiastic. "On a campus like Swarthmore,
where so many kids are interested in politics, it is incredibly important to realize
how effective grassroots movements can
be," Chris Ford 'O7 said.
Swarthmore students donated $l2O to
the 34 Million Campaign.

The menu will feature new items this

as weekly specials in place of less popular dishes such as eel udon and nori tea

rice.
"We're trying to be more authentic

said.
No personal profit can come from the
business. Qub employees are paid campus job salaries, but the administration
supports Qub mainly "because [it's] selfsufficient," according to co-founder Dan
Yue 'O5. "It's good for fund-raising, hav-

ing students as entrepreneurs."
As a result, any profits would go to
buying a new water heater or to renovating Qub's home at the Kitao Gallery,
Braunstein said.

According to Yue, most of last year's
managers, including Chris Atanasiu 'O5,
Alex Atanasiu 'O5, Roth, Yue, Wynn Wu
'O5 and Akira Irie 'O3, "burned out" from
the long work hours, but all those
involved remain enthusiastic about the

Nobel peace laureate calls for
new American code of ethics
During Nobel Peace Prize laureate
Oscar Arias's lecture on Thursday
evening, the former president of Costa
Rica called for a new American code of
ethics, a reevaluation of government
spending and the incorporation of Third
World countries into free trade.
"I hoped the 21st century would be an
age of multi-lateralism," Arias said.
"We're not off to a good start."
Arias won the Nobel Prize in 1987 for
his work in Central America, which led
to a peace accord signed in Guatamala in
August of that year, according to the

Nobel Web site.
Arias said Americans must develop a
new code of ethics, one that includes
humility and solidarity instead of pride
and individualism.

Audience member Mark Hanis 'O4
said Arias served as a "healthy
reminder" of a perspective of "peace to
make security" in the midst of "security
to make peace" ideals.
Calling for what he called a "New
Marshall Plan," Arias said five percent of
what the United States spends on military funding would be enough to provide
education and basic health care to a significant portion of Third-World countries.
"The resources are there," Arias said.
"What lacks are solidarity, vision and
courage."
Arias called free trade "imperative to

countries need access to the markets of
wealthy countries, Arias said.
The World Trade Organization (WTO),
Arias said, is supposed to promote free
trade, but free trade is impossible until
First-World countries removes protections and farmers' subsidies.
Several audience members at the lecture responded to Arias's views with

opposition, particularly concerning his

views on free trade.
"I felt, in his response to the comments, Arias embodied the ethics that he
tries to push," Lee Smithey, chair of the
peace and conflict studies program at
Swarthmore, said.
John Meyer, interim director of the
Pendle Hill Peace Network, said the
group brought Arias because of his
"bold, countercultural approach" to con-

flict.

"He focused on 'structural violence' on arms, not children," Meyer
said. "This misappropriation of funds,
funded by U.S. taxpayers, is something I
think is very important for the community to be aware of."
The Oscar Arias lecture was one in a
series of lectures this year that will
focus on peace building. The Pendle Hill
Peace Network and Forum sponsors the
series.
"We brought Oscar Arias because we
were looking for speakers who would

said.

"We especially looked for speakers

BY PAUL GOLDSMITH-PINKHAM

pgoldsml@swarthmore.edu

Last Thursday night and Friday morning,
a panel of speakers presented a discussion on
globalization and violence and the link that
exists between the two.
The symposium began on Thursday
evening with a speech by Arjun Appadurai,
professor of international studies and
anthropology at Yale. Appadurai discussed
"why small minorities, who are not threatening, are viewed as dangerous by the majority
and are subjected to violence," said Farha
Ghannam, assistant professor of anthropology
The symposium continued on Friday

morning with three more speakers: Paul
Adam Silverstein, assistant professor of
anthropology from Reed College; Lawrence
Cohn, professor of anthropology and South
Asian studies at University of California at
Berkeley; and Gregory Starrett, associate
professor of anthropology at the University
of North Carolina at Charlotte.
After each speaker's presentation, a
Swarthmore faculty member discussed and
questioned parts of the speaker's presenta-

tion. According to Nate Freed Wheeler 'O4,
this was one of the best parts of the symposium.
When Sarah Willie, assistant professor of
sociology and anthropology, responded to
Starrett's presentation on narratives of
bioterrorism, she raised new questions for
Starrett about how these fantasies of bioter-

THE

stream fantasies were not representative of
hers, Willie questioned whom they in fact
represented. Starrett's response was that the
bioterrorism fears shown in films like
"Outbreak" and books by authors like Tom
Clancy were generally the fears of elite white

men.
Student attendance was minimal, with
only about six present at the end of the talk.
The scheduling of the majority of the symposium on a Friday morning may have been
responsible for the low attendance. The symposium ran from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
Wheeler said he was disappointed that
more students did not attend the talk. "It was
a really great event," Wheeler said.
Ghannam, one of the organizers of the
event, explained that the talk was organized
with the intention of discussing the unprecedented amount of violence by groups
throughout the world despite the unprece-

dented amount of global communication and
movement between parts of the world.
The symposium's other organizer, anthropology professor Brian Axel, had already
organized several events in the past on glob-

alization.
"The interrelation of these two sites of
inquiry has preoccupied my attention since I
began my studies in historical anthropology," Axel said.
The event was sponsored by the Cooper
Foundation and supported by the depart-

ment of sociology and anthropology.

Cure for hangover
BY LEAH GEORGE-BASKIN
Daily Mini
(U-WIRE) CHAMPAIGN, 111.
Some people say they have the cure to
prevent hangovers.
Spirit Sciences, which is located in
California, believes it has a cure and is
now selling it in the United States.
The company claims its product, a
dietary supplement called RU-2L helps
protect against the harmful effects of
alcohol on the human body.
Emil Chiaberi, chief executive officer of Spirit Sciences, said RU-21 is not
a miracle pill. It does not prevent
intoxication but prevents the aftereffects of drinking.
Dr. David Lawrance, medical director of McKinley Health Center, said he
is not aware of any pill that is effective
for preventing hangovers.
"My understanding is there are by-

products of alcohol that the brain just
doesn't like," Lawrance said.
RU-21 was first created in 1972 in
Russia.
Dubbed the KGB Pill, there are
rumors that its primary intent was to
prevent intoxication all together,
Chiaberi said. The pill was released to
the Russian public in the 1990s and
within a year was a best-selling prod-

uct.

Chiaberi said the pill was just

launched in the United States in May.
"It is not meant for people who abuse
themselves but instead it is meant to
help people who have a hangover after
two or three drinks and allows them to

avoid it altogether," he said.
As a dietary supplement, RU-21
does not have to be approved by the

Food

and

Drug

Administration

because supplements fall under a different set of regulations.

STDs may lead to cancer
BY SARAH RICE
Kansas State Collegian
(U-WIRE) MANHATTAN, Kan.
Eighty percent of sexually active
people under age 25 have a form of
human papilloma virus. It is the most
common and fastest growing sexually
transmitted disease that cannot be
identified with a test.
The National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases reports there
are 5.5 million new cases of the STD
each year and at least 20 million
Americans already have been infected.
Genital warts, part of the HPV family, is becoming a more prevalent problem among college-aged Americans.
Although the actual genital wart is
not dangerous, the virus can become
cancerous if not treated through a natural immune system process, Blank
said.
"A small percentage of people that

get high-risk HPV will have them persist," she said. "They can end up with
cervical cancer."
However, the good news is 20 percent of cases of the virus are resolved
over the course of the year without
treatment. About two-thirds of people
who have sexual contact with a partner infected with genital warts will

develop warts within three months of
contact.
If detected, treatment options
include various creams or acid solutions that are applied to the infected
area, freezing the wart off with liquid
nitrogen and surgical removal.
Routine pap smears do not usually
identify the virus until it develops into
pre-cancer or cervical cancer.
"If the pap smears are abnormal,
they may need another test, maybe a

biopsy," Blank said. "It's important to

know the pap smear is not an HPV
test."

BY EMILY GASSER
egasserl@swarthmore.edu
Admit it. Sometimes it's fun to just kick back, let
loose,and be a girl. For all you Swatties of either gender out
there who want to get in touch with your pink-fuzzy-maribou-heels side or just find a new way to spend your
Thursday nights, here are a few ideas.
If you're looking for an opportunity to express your feminine side, the Women's Resource Center is a great place to
start. The WRC boasts a TV, DVD player and kitchen
stocked with the basic baking ingredients. "We do spontaneous things sometimes," said board member Olivia Toro
'O5. For more regularly scheduled girl time, come by every
Tuesday evening at 8 p.m. for two episodes of "Sex and the
City".
If cooking is more your style, Lissie Jaquette 'O7 and
Waverly Lutz 'O7 begun holding late-night teas every
Thursday. "We were talking about how we both really like
baking and cooking and how we don't get to do much of it
here," Jaquette said. "So we decided to start doing this. We
thought it would be a fun alternative to Pub Nite." The first
iteration was dubbed Midnight Moonlight Teatime and took
place outside Wharton. They baked scones, made tea and
star-gazed. "Everybody was really happy and excited, so we
kept doing it," Lutz said. The second event, Midnight
Aurora Tea, took advantage of the WRC kitchen. "We were
looking for the aurora borealis," Jaquette said. "We couldn't
see it, but we did see a lot of shooting stars. We spent until
3 a.m. in the WRC courtyard." Jaquette emphasized that
Midnight Teatime isn't an all-girls event. "It was about a 5050 mix, if not a little guy-heavy," she says.
And who on campus hasn't heard of the Knit Wits, Swat's
knitting club? Anyone can join, regardless of experience.
"We're basically a teaching club," President Lan Le 'O4 said.
"We're open to all levels of knitters. We'll lend you needles,
and give you yarn and advice. We do have books ofpatterns
that we lend out." According to the club Web site
www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/knitwits/, even the occasional renegade crocheter or quilter will come to a meeting.
"We just sit around and knit and gossip, basically," Le said.

"We do some charity-type things, too. Right now we're knitting baby garments for women's shelters." Men are welcome, but don't expect to meet many guys at the meetings,
on Tuesdays at 4:15 in Parrish Parlours. "There's one guy
who shows up now and then, and I think there might be a
few on the mailing list," Le said. "It's kind of rare to get a
guy. I think they hide."
Having your own girls' night out can be easy, cheap and
rewarding. Take out a DVD from McCabe and have a movie
night. What better way to bond with friends than over a
chick flick (or action, drama, horror—whatever your pref-

erence) and a big bag of salty, buttery popcorn? Give yourself facials and pore over last month's Cosmo. Everyone's
got their personal favorite brand of mud mask; I'd recommend Burt's Bees' Green Goddess Herbal Spa clay mask.
Take a purity test. Or two. Or three, (www.armory.com/tests
has lots.) Read the questions aloud. Giggle. It's good for you.
(Yes, even you males.) And remember, Cygnet shopping
isn't just a guy thing. For more variety, use the online version at The Daily Jolt; they've got all four years. Whatever
you do, the point is to laugh, relax and enjoy yourself. As
Cyndi Lauper so aptly put it, "Girls just wanna have fun."

sume. Singers such as Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey and
Celine Dion have covered various powerhouse ballads. Most
notable is Houston's cover of "I Will Always Love You,"
which topped the charts in 1994 and, with Houston's commanding and stunning vocal ability, gave Dolly Parton's old
semi-hit a new, vibrant life in adult contemporary popular
music. Now younger artists are experimenting in this subclassification of music, a forerunner being Mandy Moore.
If Avril Lavigne is known as the antithesis of Britney
Spears, Moore could be considered a middle ground
between the two. Ofall the female pop stars, she is the least
concerned with image and subsequently can delve outside
of the safe realms that other artists must limit themselves
to. Her most daring endeavor to date is the release of

covers.

What makes Moore's album a particularly interesting
listen are the songs she decided to cover. Except for a
select few hits like "Have a Little Faith in Me" and "One
Way or Another" the songs are relatively obscure. Even
her rendition of Elton John's "Mona Lisas and Mad
Hatters" may not ring a bell when you listen to it, because
he never released the song commercially. Despite this fact,
one can tell that Moore put her heart and soul into singing
the twelve songs she decided to cover.
Her voice has come a long way from her debut album
and the bubblegum pop of its first single, "Candy." Though
there seems to be a dichotomy in the nineteen-year-old's
renditions of songs from the '7os and 'Bos, Moore does it
well and accentuates otherwise mature folk songs such as
Carly Simon's "Anticipation" in a lighthearted pop/rock
tone that still keeps the general essence of the song intact.
While young fans of Moore might not necessarily relate to
this album, at least they have the opportunity to be
exposed to various types of music from before they were
born, even though it is presented in a different context.
Coverage is an album that brings together a thoughtful
collection of songs that Moore enjoys, as well as giving
the listener a sampling of many artists' music to inspire
further musical exploration.

Student's straw man to invade Cleveland
BY MELISSA PHRUKSACHART
mphruksl@swarthmore.edu
If you've ever enjoyed lounging on the oversized white
chair on Parrish Beach, you can thank Jake Beckman 'O4.
Beckman, an art major, constructed the chair during the
last three weeks of his sophomore year.
"A bunch of us pushed it out there [at night] during the
middle of finals," he said. "When I first put it up, nobody
knew who did it except for my friends. It was a random isolated event; it was more pure in a sense. I just got a kick
out of people enjoying it for what it was
I like that people can interact with it. The best thing is when I see groups
of little kids sitting [there]."
Other Beckman works include a pair of oversized red
Converse All-Stars placed on top of the Parrish chimney
(with co-creators with Tim Applebee 'O3, Rajaa Shakir 'O4,
and Anna Stratton 'O4), an oversized light switch attached
to the front of McCabe and a cherry-red fire hydrant
Beckman photographed in various locations on campus,
all during his sophomore year. Beckman said he preferred
to leave his pieces without titles. "By titling something,
you control the scope of your audience," he said. Except for
the chair, Beckman's previous pieces have had another
thing in common: None of them was permanent. "To maintain the spontaneity, I tried to keep the [other] sculptures
up for a week," he said.
However, Beckman will be venturing into new territories in public art this fall as his latest piece was chosen for
public installation in Cleveland, Ohio. The piece, which is
untitled, is a large figure pulling a cube attached to a rope,
a small-scale version of which can currently be seen
between Trotter and the Rose Garden. "The model in front
of Trotter isn't an exact replica. It's a small-scale model,
but it's a variation of the proposed piece," said Beckman.
Earlier in the year, Beckman, an Ohio native, read a
call for submissions for a proposal for a public art piece to
be installed upon the grassy Mall B near Cleveland's City
Hall. The Daniel Burnham Foundation the Cleveland
Public Arts Association encouraged artists to submit a 350word synopsis of a proposed piece, along with a slide port...

folio and a resume. Beckman said he thought, "What do I
have to lose?" and decided his piece of a figure pulling a
cube on a rope would work well in the 80 foot by 300 foot
space.
"I picked it because the shape of the mall works with
the longitudinal composition," Beckman said. "It's a cube
and a figure. It would work differently on a square, or a
circle, or a rectangle." Beckman was interested in the way
he could incorporate a sense of whimsy into the space.
"The cube is the size of a small building, and there are
buildings around it, and the figure is pulling the cube, so
your mind can make the jump. It playfully insinuates that

the surrounding buildings could be pulled in the same

way. I like whimsical art... but, in terms of truly integrating it into Cleveland, into the functions that people do in
that space, it's independent of its space," he said.

vibrancy of the figure," while finding "ways to keep those
qualities intact on a large scale."

Beckman consulted with numerous engineers, architects, students in the two fields, and manufacturers in
order to choose the materials for his work. In the end, he
constructed the cube out of plywood and steel studs; the
figure will be made out of plate aluminum. The rope will
be a steel cable surrounded in six inch plastic pipe and
wrapped in manila rope. "It'll have the appearance of a
seven-inch hemp rope, but it will be much lighter,"
Beckman said. "When it rains, the rope doubles its weight,
and it soaks up rain. I want as little sag as possible to keep

that tension and balance."
Beckman flew into Cleveland the Monday after fall

break to present his piece along with the three other finalists. "By Wednesday, they called me and said, 'We picked
your proposal, but you need to reduce your budget,' he
said. The installation process added a slew of new difficulties, as Beckman had forgotten to anticipate its cost.
Beckman's estimated cost was $95,000 when he first presented. "They were worried that it would be $BO,OOO to
install and ship
they needed a guarantee that the
$lOO,OOO grant would be sufficient for the project." In reality, Beckman found that he would need $120,000 total to
complete the project. He is pursuing donations from sup"

Beckman sent in his proposal in August. On Sept. 16, he
was told that he was one of four finalists. He was given a
stipend to research and investigate how he could make the
project become a reality.
It's one thing to sit in your studio and make something,
a little wire figure and a little plaster cube," Beckman
mused, "but to think about making a 30-foot tall cube and
a 35-ft tall figure, there are so many other things you have
to take into account. I didn't know which way to go. It

turns out I should've just gone to the engineers first,
because I had to figure out how to make everything bigger
structurally." Beckman was determined to retain the "pristine quality of the cube, the gestural quality and the

"One of the avenues I pursued was talking to the college. They offered to help me fund-raise, to get a list together of grants and alumni to contact," he said. "I essentially
need to raise $20,000 within a year. The project is dependent on raising these additional funds."
When asked how he felt about being chosen for such a
prestigious event, Beckman said, "It's a great honor and

the fact that people will be able to interact with it 365 days
a year; they don't have to go to a museum to see it. In addition to beautifying the community, there are so many community businesses that are involved, so in a sense it's a
communal effort. It's not just about me putting it out there
there are all these different players in the game. It's like
a dance, almost."

it a shirt from Ralph Lauren, Gap, L.L. Bean, or a flea market for a smashing 50 cents (assuming it's clean, hole-free
and does not look like the rag your mom uses to clean the

can wear forever while
mixing them with cheaper,

trendier pieces (you can
find some great unique items at second-hand stores; there
are a ton on South Street).
Some examples of timeless pieces that everyone should
have in their closets include a button-down white shirt,
well-cut pairs of black, gray and khaki pants, a pair offlattering jeans (neither tapered nor acid-washed), a jean jacket and, for girls, a little black dress. Gap, J. Crew, Old Navy
and Express may be boring, but there's a reason everyone
shops there: They're great places to find the core of your
wardrobe. If you want to go crazy, do it with your accessories. Accessorize with a funky handbag, fun jewelry, a
colorful hat or scarf, or kitschy shoes.
You must be a bit confused. You must be thinking, "If

we can shop anywhere, then why do labels create such a
stir? Well, dear readers, you must first understand that
designer labels were really only adopted as a ruse.
Designers reasoned that the more expensive the T-shirt,
the more its wearers would feel "superior" to the general
public. Moreover, by placing a logo such as FCUK on a Tshirt, the designer made the public an integral part of its
marketing team and, in this case, an evil ploy to kill the
elderly of shock.
Now we are not saying that all designer clothes are
tacky, because this would certainly be a lie. Some designer
clothing really does measure up to its price tag. But in
most cases, you will probably be able to find an exact replica of the designer item made by a "cheaper" brand. One
caveat: A lot of the time things are cheap because they're
bad quality (H&M and Urban Outfitters), but not always.
It's better to buy items in a mid-level price range than risk
them falling apart at those rare times when you do laundry.
Confusing matters more, there

are some labels that are
stylish and tasteful, but only in moderation. We are elated
that Burberry hats, scarves and coats have made their way
onto campus, but let's not take it to extremes. Last summer, Oriana was innocently enjoying a coffee in a quaint
pizzeria in Italy when a vision of a tan plaid blob drove her
body into an uncontrollable jerk, causing the steaming hot
liquid to spill onto her knees. This unfortunate woman
happened to be sporting a Burberry plaid coat, with a
Burberry plaid shirt, tucked into a knee-length Burberry
plaid skirt. And her accessories consisted of a Burberry
plaid handbag and a Burberry plaid umbrella. Forget milk
of magnesia. This woman was enough to induce vomiting
in anyone.
Our suggestion to you, then, is: if you are going to go
high-end, go classic. It is the safest and chicest plan. The

reason Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein are so celebrated is
that their styles are simple and timeless. Even if you can't
afford to shop there, you can afford to step into the store,
memorize the style and find it someplace else. Stores in the
mall all knock off designers. Caroline sadly found this out
when she saw copies of her brand-new Burberry coat in
The Limited, J. Crew, Banana Republic, and the Gap. And
if you feel bad about wearing a knock-off, don't. It's not the
label that matters, it's how you wear it. Plus, designers rob
flea markets and old movies as inspiration for their collections. Go find one and beat them to it!

A very lukewarm 'April'
BY ESTER BLOOM

eblooml@swarthmore.edu

April is diametrically opposed to Thanksgiving. That
statement, as deep as it may be, is at the heart of "Pieces
of April," a new comedy-drama by Peter Hedges. A twenty-something rebel named April who discarded her family in favor of independent city life attempts to bury the
hatchet by inviting her family to eat a Thanksgiving dinner of her own creation. But by their very natures, April
and the bourgeois holiday of Thanksgiving are at odds.
Much of the humor derives from the ineptness with

which April, played by Katie Holmes in dark eye makeup

and torn clothes, attempts to reconcile herself with
Thanksgiving. Most importantly, she can't, and has
never tried to, cook. The only time she's ever been in the
kitchen, her family recalls on the trip over, is when she
set a fire in her old home, possibly by accident.
There

remains

also

the

ideological

aspect

of

Thanksgiving to which April is opposed, as a good progressive punk should be. In one scene, she lands in an
apartment filled with Chinese immigrants, attempting to
explain the origin of the holiday. Over and over again,
she stumbles while trying to construct a narrative that
combines both the Hallmark and Howard Zinn version of
history.

In the end, she settles on a version that deals with
how, for at least one meal, two very differentkinds of people got along. That is what makes Thanksgiving really
worth celebrating.
That, of course, is what April is going for. She will
make a meal good enough to redeem herself and bring
herself, the black sheep, back into the fold.
Without obstacles in April's way, there would be no
movie. Some, however, work markedly better in the plot
than others. Far more poignant than April's broken oven
is her mother, played with grace and depth by Patricia
Clarkson, who can't summon up a single positive memory of the oldest daughter with whom she never got along.
In the car on the trip to April's apartment, the moth-

er, ironically named Joy, passes out candy to her other
children to fill them up and encourages them to think of
ways they will hide the food April serves them. Her husband, a well-meaning simp played by Oliver Piatt, chastises her, but not too severely. In fact, no one can say anything to Joy, because Joy has breast cancer.
Because the movie never gives a glimpse of pre-cancer
Joy, it is hard to say to what degree her disease determines her actions. Possibly she always said exactly what
was on her mind, no matter how cruel or inappropriate,
but the movie implies that it is the cancer that has freed
her tongue. She knows she is dying, so she spares no one.
As such, she is the most interesting character in the
story. While April rushes around, enlisting help from
sympathetic (and token ethnic) neighbors and crepepapering the stairway banister, Joy internalizes her
impulses to do a thousand things at once. The movie
begins with her family dashing through the house, calling her name, only to find Joy at last buckled into the
front seat of the station wagon in the garage.
Joy's dislike of her daughter, whenever she speaks of
it, seems particularly believable because Joy has no reason to lie. But it doesn't jibe with the April the audience
knows, and therein lies the most glaring flaw of the
movie besides its cop-out of an ending. How could wellmeaning, sweet, pigtailed April be the drugged-out banshee and possible arsonist her family remembers?
Much of that has to do with casting. Katie Holmes simply does not look or act tough enough to be even a reformed
delinquent. But the script does her no favors either. Her
supposed leftism is demonstrated only by her black
boyfriend and vegetarianism. (The story's real leftist, a
vegan who refuses to help April, is a hilarious caricature of
vegans as elitist control freaks.)
Other caricatures abound in the movie, some more
racist than others and all unexpected, as they come from
the writer of the creative, sensitive '9os hit "What's
Eating Gilbert Grape?" But it would take a lot more than
inoffensive supporting characters, no matter how hard
they tried, to redeem this movie.

Amoral stupidity
What ever happened to "ethical intelligence"?
The term seems to imply that a person is, first, "ethical," guided by a principle of respect for others' rights
and others' dignity, and, second, "intelligent," possessed of a clear understanding of the consequences of
their actions.
Although we're supposed to be a smart school and
an idealistic, activist school, we're still seeing some disturbing indicators of how far some of us have yet to go.
Most disturbing is, of course, a recent assault on an
Acapulco's delivery employee. The fact that one of us
would actually punch a stranger in the face is chilling.
If, as often happens, alcohol becomes a defense, it
would be a poor excuse. Indeed, this is only the latest of
a long list of outrages, ranging from smashing the
Intercultural Center sign to trashing Paces, that people
have blamed on intoxication after the fact. The thing is
that we all know what alcohol does to us, that it erodes
our inhibitions and emotional maturity as we get
drunk, and that, therefore, it takes a mature, self-aware
adult to drink safely and responsibly. It is the college's
policy to effectively treat us all as mature adults in this
regard. The aforementioned incidents suggest that
there are some of us who aren't and ought to know they
aren't but who choose to indulge anyway. Is that any
less of an irresponsible, inconsiderate choice?
Nor is this an isolated incident. Delivery employees,
in the context of this story, complained to us of a pattern of disrespectful and inconsiderate behavior among
students this year. The rate of complaints and harassment, of prank deliveries to others' rooms, of intercepting others' pizzas and of generally childish behavior
has increased.
More than that, we can't help but notice a disturbing
tendency of a number of our peers to treat other human
beings as furniture. They treat our staff as automatic
card-swipers, toilet-cleaners and key-makers; they treat
Ville tradespeople as overpriced food dispeners; they
treat other students as objects of gossip and amusement
or as annoying obstacles to personal advancement.
This is, of course, human nature, and it's the nature
of busy academics to lose some of their perspective on
life once the workload gets heavy. Even so, with all the
talk about fighting for fair wages and against unjust
wars, we'd hope to find a bit more morality and common human decency at Swarthmore's elite campus
than at an average institution.
Sure, no one is perfect, and sure, most of the little
cruelties people perpetrate are nothing earthshattering. But the more we become accustomed to seeing
such attitudes the more likely we are to excuse them.
When a steady accumulation of excusable mistreatment of others is allowed to develop, the inexcusable,
shocking events will inevitably erupt.
While some of our students work steadfastly to
uphold what remains of our ethical intelligence tradition, the ones who commit petty vandalism, leave messes in the hallways, engage in anonymous flamewars on
The Daily Jolt and, of course, beat up on delivery guys

are just as steadily eroding it.

Whatever is happening to make some of us think
being jaded, cynical and amoral is cool, we need to stop
it now. We who are struggling to fight the screaming
five-year-olds inside ourselves ought to loudly express
our outrage and condemnation when delinquents let
their inner five-year-olds run wild. We need to stop
blaming it all on an administration with limited
resources; we need to stop acting like the actions of

some random drunks have no effect on us or on other
people. Too often, we see something going on and let it
slide, wanting it to be someone else's responsibility.
For all we know, a verbal confrontation earlier that
a young father trying to do his

night might have meant

job would've been spared the humiliation of being
struck by a customer in public as well as medical and
auto repair costs he could ill afford. When there are
people on our campus amoral enough to simply take
out their frustrations on another human being and stupid enough to do so regardless of the possibility of getting their dorm blacklisted and themselves arrested,

Contrary

to Randy Goldstein's
his
last
column,
in

"Protestors Should Work With the
Law" (Oct. 30, pg. 19), I believe the
actions of those associated with the
Swarthmore Coalition for the Digital
Commons and Why War? qualify as
legitimate ones that the First
Amendment protects, and they should
not be dismissed as "a romantic
notion of protest."
Diebold's flawed, vulnerable voting system is a feature of the
American electoral process that
requires exposure, and the company
is harshly threatening these groups
only because it realizes the students'
actions undermine the company's

As Wendy Seltzer, an electronic
civil-liberties lawyer, commented in

Diebold's [actions] seem
more desperate than
any actions the student

groups are employing.

The New York Times on Monday,
copyright laws are designed to protect
creative expression, and companies
cannot claim infringement to suppress damaging information. This
makes Diebold's cease-and-desist

orders seem more desperate than any
actions the student groups are currently employing. By posting these

inconsistencies on their Web sites, the
student groups are exercising their
freedoms of speech.
Swarthmore's decision not to support the student groups officially is
disappointing, because I think any
institution should be concerned with
the security and value of the electoral
process. But it is clear from the picture of Smith and Pavlosky on page
seven of the business section of
Monday's New York Times that these
student groups do not need the help of
Deans Gross or Bloom to publicize
their worthy cause.

An ethical racism
I am a racist. Not a Reverse
racist." Nor do I engage in JeanPaul
Sartre's
"anti-racist
racism."
If anything, I engage in proracist racism. I'm a straight-up
racist, no chaser. The British
would say I'm a racialist.
Racism has a negative connotation. Indeed, Merriam-Webster
and the venerable Oxford
English Dictionary give it negative denotations. But they are
wrong to do so, for racism is neiTARU TAYLOR
ther negative nor positive. It is
neutral.
Gadfly
I am Negro. President Bush
is Caucasian. These statements
are neither positive nor negative, neither good nor bad. That I'm black and President Bush is
white are statements of fact; no more, no less. Still, they are racist

statements.
When I acknowledge my or anybody else's race, I'm literally
being racist, for "racism" is classifying people according to race.
This isn't some semantic game I'm playing for kicks. The notion
that racism is negative and evil is problematic, because people
thereby avoid discussions of race. The worst thing to be called,
that which is most politically incorrect, is "racist." Even more
than politics and religion, people avoid the topic of race. How
absurd that America's most pressing problem, its subject most in
need of dialogue, is taboo.

Edwards best bet for the Dems
of the doubt as they do now, especially if the economy is
booming. The Democrats' only hope is the debates.

BY EDWIN WAY
ewayl@swarthmore.edu
Like Kerry and Gephardt, Edwards was fooled. He
thought Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and didn't want to find the West playing brinksmanship games
with a leader who had started two wars and in '9l didn't
back down until his army was destroyed. Edwards and
the others were not alone. Prime ministers with their
own intelligence agencies, newspaper editors with their
own investigative journalists all concluded Iraq had
weapons of mass destruction. There was a legitimate
argument for going to war against Iraq. Democrats
shouldn't dismiss Edwards because of one vote.
Like most liberals, I wish we could have as radically
liberal a president as Bush is radically conservative. We
aren't going to get that liberal in Howard Dean. He's
against gun control, he's not pushing nationalized
health care and even his foreign policy isn't liberal. He
was against the war only because he wasn't convinced
Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. He didn't give
the reasons Swatties gave: War would kill innocent
Iraqis, and we shouldn't be imposing democracy on a
foreign culture. These are reasons Swatties questioned
the war in Afghanistan, a war Dean supported.
If we are going to choose a moderate, we better be
sure he's a winner. Could Dean win it? He has money
and momentum, right? Not enough. The Democrats
won't win by outspending Bush (Dean's raised $14.5 million, Bush, $73.5 million). Furthermore, we can't just
count on things getting worse in Iraq. If next year the
situation's ambiguous, people will give Bush the benefit

letter

to

Dean could turn the debates into another disaster. In
2000, Gore's convention bounce vanished when in the
debates Bush's self-effacing humor made him likable,
while Gore's sighs and aggressiveness made him seem
like a know-it-all liberal. Dean is a lot like Gore; Dean is
also an Ivy-League patrician, and his style is aggressive
and abrasive. Democrats need someone with
Clinton/Reagan flair. The only Democrat that fits that
bill is John Edwards. As a trial lawyer you can't have as
successful a career as Edwards' if you don't know how
to convince juries of regular Americans that your position is right. Democrats need someone with Edwards'
experience and charisma to make our case next fall.
What about Wesley Clark? He, like Edwards, is from
the South, and the last three successful Democratic candidates were Southerners. However, Clark's never run
for public office, and his recent conversion to the Dems
is questionable. Clark says he was against the war, but
go to http://www.fair.org to see what he said last winter.
You should support Edwards not only because he'll
win, but also because he's a Democrat we can trust to
help America's working class. Edwards' mom was a
unionized postal worker, and his dad worked in a mill.
For his 1999-to-2002 votes Edwards got a 100 percent
from the SEIU, AFT and CWA, a 92 percent from the
AFL and a 95 percent from the UAW The liberal
Americans for Democratic Action gave Edwards an 83
percent. Edwards has low poll numbers, but low expectations can work wonders. In Nov. 1991, Clinton was in
sth place in New Hampshire.

Bringing back Al Gore in 2004
Dear Editor:
Nine great candidates are running for the
Democratic presidential nomination. Some of them
might be able to defeat George W. Bush next year, and I

would support any of them who won the nomination.
But the best Democratic candidate isn't yet in the race.
Al Gore has the strongest leadership experience of the
candidates, is beloved by many independents and rankand-file Democrats, has never supported the war in Iraq

THE PHOENIX

and
as the Diebold memos make yet even more clear
has not lost a general election in his 27 years in politics.
He's our best shot to beat Bush, and he's the leader
our country needs. Write email@fladems.com to urge
the Florida Democratic Party to include Gore in their
Dec. 6 straw poll. The rest of the country deserves to see
the strength of Gore's grassroots support.

November 6, 2003

Racism permeates our historical narrative much like the
Force permeates George Lucas's science-fiction narrative. Like
the Force, racism is neutral. Like the Force, racism has its heroes
and villains. Like the Force, racism has its positive and negative.
As the light side of the Force, Luke Skywalker is positive. As the
dark side, Darth Vader is negative. Racism has similar poles, of
black equity on the one axis, white supremacy on the other. "The
Autobiography of Malcolm X" epitomizes the former,' Adolf
Hitler's "Mein Kampf," the latter. As someone once joked, it's too
bad Hitler gave racism a bad name. Alex Haley's "Roots" and
Margaret Mitchell's "Gone with the Wind" share the same dialectic, as do Rev. Dr. King and J. Edgar Hoover, architect of the FBI,
who swore to prevent the rise of a "Black Messiah." Interestingly,
his first assignment was Marcus Garvey.
America is a Venn diagram of overlapping races.
Afrocentrism and Black studies are one circle. Eurocentrism and
White studies are the other circle. When the Honorable Elijah
Muhammad, founder of the Nation of Islam, named the black
man "Original Man," he put him back in the center of
Afrocentrism. But W.E.B. Dußois's civil rights movement thrust
him along the margins ofEurocentrism as "Marginal Man." The
black separatist, like the white separatist (who should not necessarily be confused with the white segregationist), lives in his own
circle. When he interacts with whites, he meets them halfway
in the space where the Venn circles overlap. As a rule,
Americans are separatist, yet the black integrationist leaves his
own circle, the brotherman for the otherman. He assimilates into
whiteness.
Whites prefer blacks who play the role of Marginal Man, a
token role which confuses equality and sameness. Marginal Man
identifies with the White Man. Thus, if imitation is the sincerest
form of flattery, Dußois's Talented Tenth are most sincere.
Tyranny enjoys flattery, so the white supremacist prefers Dußois
to Garvey, King to Malcolm X.
But the white who would overcome white supremacy has to
"decenter." Jean Piaget's term signifies imaginatively seeing the
world from a foreign perspective, one that fundamentally challenges one's own ethnocentrism. For starters, that means reading, and rereading, "The Autobiography of Malcolm X" and
"Roots." That means understanding how and why Garvey's
"Declaration of Rights of the Negro Peoples of the World" is to
black Pan-Africa what Jefferson's "Declaration of (the Propertied
White Man's) Independence" is to white America.
As for the black, he should be himself, not an imitation white.
But to be himself, he has to "recenter." This term signifies overcoming white supremacy, that which systematically tyrannizes
him into a marginal existence and an inferiority complex, so as
to see the world from his own perspective. To recenter is to be
central, not peripheral; Original Man, not Marginal Man. For
what he should read, and reread, and understand, as points of
departure for such a recentering, see the above paragraph.
Decentering and recentering bring about positive racism, which
is circumspect ethnocentrism. Negative racism is about myopic
ethnocentrism, the proper term for which is chauvinism.

look no further than A.N.S.W.E.R. and its beliefs.
A.N.S.W.E.R.'s biggest issue, not surprisingly, is the con-

tinuing U.S. presence in Iraq. The group opposes not only a
continued American occupation, but also any United Nations
role. A.N.S.W.E.R. advocates "self-determination for the Iraqi
people," which is, of course, a good thing, but goes on to say,
Iraq has been a genuinely sovereign country.
"Since 1958

oil." This statement is simply not true: Before last March's
invasion, Iraq did not have "self-rule" or "self-determination."
It was a dictatorial police state ruled by one man, Saddam
Hussein. Should we have invaded Iraq? It is a difficult question with no easy answer, but one thing that is beyond dispute
is that we did not invade a democratic paradise. We invaded a
country whose people had no freedom and who lived in fear of
their government.
Some leftists have criticized President Bush for dividing
the world with his "us versus them" statements since Sept. 1L
Ironically, A.N.S.W.E.R. uses just as stark a dichotomy, one in
which the United States is always wrong and always motivated by greed or racism and nations in the developing world are
always innocent victims. It is not just on the Iraq issue that
the group reveals its bias; the pamphlet has one section entitled "Stop the War Against Cuba!" Like our Iraqi policy, our
Cuban policy is questionable. As in its statement on Iraq,
though, A.N.S.W.E.R. goes overboard in criticizing U.S. policy
(the Bush administration is accused of encouraging "terrorist
acts") while totally ignoring the fact that Cuba is ruled by a
dictator who denies his people freedom and civil rights.
A.N.S.W.E.R.'s leaders are extremists, and extremists of
any kind, left or right, tend to be blind to facts that do not
match their worldview, as the pamphlet demonstrates in its
statement on the Israel-Palestine crisis. Many on the far right
dismiss the immense suffering of the Palestinians and their
demands for a state of their own as unimportant, a position
that is profoundly uncompassionate. Many on the far left,
though, see Israel as nothing but an occupying power.
A.N.S.W.E.R.'s pamphlet views the Israeli occupation as "part
of a decades-long colonial campaign by imperialism to dominate the strategic and oil-rich Middle East." That's it? No
mention of the hostility that Israel's neighbors have had
toward it since 1948? No mention of the fact that many in the
Arab world desire not just a Palestinian state but also an end
to Israel? But no, it has to be Western colonialism. The world
is so much easier when everyone is either an evil imperialist
or an innocent victim.
This is just one pamphlet, but it expresses the views of one
of the major anti-war organizations. Most of those who
opposed the war surely did not believe that the United States
was an evil racist empire. Most probably believed what is
true: that the United States is a very flawed nation but also a
very great one that has, on balance, been a force for good in
the world. Let us all hope that major left-liberal voices in this
country offer serious solutions to today's pressing issues, not
simplistic slogans about colonialism.

Down Under.

links to other sites and
not copyrighted material
have been found. The music industry is now saying that
just linking is in itself illegal," reports Slashdot (Oct. 28).
Yes, that's right. It's now illegal to link to a site that's
in violation of copyright law. (One wonders what the
legal antics the music industry has in store for Google.)
The argument, I suspect, is based on a hyperlink on a
Web page falling under the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act's provision against providing "unauthorized access"
to a copyrighted work
a highly tenuous accusation at
best. (This is roughly akin to accusing someone of
accomplice to bank robbery because the thief stopped her
on the street to ask for directions). Of course, it's also the
policy our own school is using in the Diebold case: If you
link to the Why War? site to draw attention to the memos,
the college will theoretically pull the plug on your site,
which is something we ought specifically to be advising
the administration to reconsider.
Of course, what is most puzzling about the music
industry's claim against mp3s4free.net is that, while the
linking is arguably illegal in the United States, it's not
against Australian law under any interpretation. Given
the internationality of the Internet, how much can digital
copyright laws remain a national concern? Perhaps the
most pressing front of this issue is that Google
an
American company, subject to American laws
has
agreed to remove any site in violation of the DMCA.
Unfortunately, while Google is an American company,

music

letters

it's not an American service but the Web's search engine.
A site in Australia that violates American copyright law
might still be yanked from the Google listings, and in
today's world, that can virtually kill the page.
The censorship battle goes beyond the DMCA, of
course. Symantec, a frequent proponent of censorship, is
advocating expanding the law to prohibit transmission of
information and tools that could potentially be used by
regardless of whether or not they could be
hackers
used for other, legitimate purposes, like improving server security against hackers. Meanwhile, its recent
Internet security suite, among other things, includes

parental controls to filter out Web sites "unsuitable" for
children. The software cuts off access to nearly all progun sites (under the category of "weapons") while not
touching anti-gun sites
and this sort of software is
required by law for libraries and schools.
In a global world, on a global Internet, copyright laws
are necessarily vague and indistinct. Until an international policy on digital copyright is reached, it's unlikely
that we'll have a solution that works at all, as the DMCA
currently does not. In the meantime, the United States is
fighting a losing battle; more importantly, it is fighting a
battle it should never have taken up.

This leaves us with an important question, though:

How do we protect copyrights without promoting censorship? For all that people attack copyright law, it is undeniably necessary, and it is used legitimately to protect
against plagiarism and theft as well as illegitimately to
prevent free speech.
What needs to be done is a general rollback of some
current copyright provisions. The use of forced ceaseand-desist orders should be restricted to commercial violations only
that is, if the violation of copyright does
not directly effect the profits derived from that work,
immediate cease and desist cannot be filed. Sharing a
CD's worth of music on the Internet, yes; sharing internal
company memos, no. No one made money off the memos.
In addition, it should be made clear that linking to a copyright violation is not a copyright violation. Finally, legitimate use should gain priority. If information can be used
to aid in breaking copyright law (by hackers) or in helping other people (in server design), this is not illegal.
Are these changes we're likely to see soon? No. But
that is no reason not to work toward them.

Neglected stories Inventing controversy
Dear Editor:
I was very disappointed in the minimal coverage in last week's Phoenix of "Jerusalem
Women Speak: Three Women, Three Faiths, One
Shared Vision," the talk by one Israeli and two
Palestinian women. Everything included in the
article ("Israeli women share a peaceful vision,"
Oct. 30, pg. 6) had already appeared beforehand
in the publicity for the talk. In particular I'm
saddened that none of Damen, Nassar and
Keshet's words were included; they were articulate, informative and moving. Damen's experiences taking Hebrew classes while working with
children on a radio program (until the Israeli
Army destroyed the station), Nassar's description of how military checkpoints impact her life
as a university professor, and Keshet's human
rights activism made a deep impression on me
not only from the injustices and fear that reach
people at the most basic level of their everyday
lives, but from how they manage to maintain a
sense of hope despite it all. I was struck most of
all by how deeply respectful they were of the
humanity and dignity of everyone caught in the
political conflict in Israel-Palestine and how
respectful they were of their audience at
Swarthmore. In light of the significant attention
devoted to Morton Klein's racist remarks vilifying Palestinians and attempting to dehumanize
them in order to justify the use of military violence, it is especially shameful that The Phoenix
chose to neglect the perspectives offered by
Rawan Damen, Mai Nassar and Yehudit Keshet.

Tide thrashes Villa Julie
BY REUBEN HEYMAN-KANTOR
rheymanl@swarthmore.edu
The Swarthmore women's soccer team finished its season this Saturday with a 6-0 thrashing of Viiia Julie
College at Clothier Field. The victory left the Garnet Tide
(9-9,4-6) with a record at or above .500 for the third straight
season. On Wednesday, however, Swarthmore lost its final
conference match of the season on the road to archrival
Haverford, dropping Swarthmore's conference record one
game behind last season's mark of 5-5. The Garnet Tide
will lose all three captains to graduation this year, including Katey McCaffrey, Rebecca Rogers and Catherine
Salussolia.
In the final game of the season, Swarthmore faced a weak
non-conference opponent in Villa Julie College. The
Mustangs arrived at Clothier Field with a 2-14-1, record; a
mark that put little fear into their opponents. "We knew we
had a chance to end on a good note. We wanted to make sure
we played on a high level," Salussolia said.
The Garnet Tide quickly jumped on the Mustangs, opening the scoring in just the sixth minute of play. Kasie Groom
'O7 sent a cross toward the goal from the right side of the
field which found Natalie Negrey 'O7 unmarked in the middle of the penalty box. Negrey headed the ball back toward
the far post, where McCaffrey calmly collected the ball and
slotted it past Villa Julie goalkeeper Katie Rodriguez for the
gamewinner. In the 20th minute, Jane Sachs 'O7 put the
Garnet Tide up 2-0 with a shot from inside the penalty area.
Rebecca Strauss 'O6 gave Swarthmore a 3-0 halftime lead
when she finished a McCaffrey corner kick first time from
inside the six-yard box.
In the second half, Swarthmore continued to pile on the
goals. Jessica Zagory 'O5 scored her first goal of the season
in the 63nd minute when Villa Julie was once again unable
to clear the ball out of their penalty box. As Val Maulbeck
'O6 and Laura Twichell 'O5 battled the Mustang defense,
Zagory was able to make a back-post run unmarked. When
the ball squirted out, Zagory knocked the ball in just ahead
of Twichell's foot to give Swarthmore a 4-0 lead. Two minutes later, Monica Larimar 'O5 scored her first goal of the
season off a McCaffrey assist to make the lead 5-0. Zagory
finished off the scoring in the 90th minute of play with a
beautiful goal off McCaffrey's third assist of the night. "The
last goal was awesome. Mac's pass to Zags, and her finish
was a really good way to end the season," Salussolia said.
The conference schedule ended on a less upbeat note, as

Swarthmore lost 1-0 to Haverford Oct. 29. "We really
should have been better than them. They were a lot faster
than us, did a lot of 1-2 passes around us. We chased the
ball too much. We didn't combat it well enough. We just
weren't in to it. I know everyone really cared, but it just
didn't work out," Negrey said. In rainy weather, the Fords
were able to score the lone goal of the game in the 35nd
minute of play. Jordan Shakeshaft 'O5 lost control of the
ball inside the Garnet penalty box after a strong challenge
from a Haverford attacker. In the ensuing scramble,
Andrea Fishman tapped the ball past Salusssolia from the
seat of her pants. "There were two fouls on the play,"
Salussolia said. "Shaky was fouled, and on the goal I had
the ball in my hands but their forward slid through me.
She knocked it out of my hands, and put the loose ball in
the net." After the collision, Shakeshaft was forced to leave
the game with a concussion.

Despite the disappointing conference finish, Salussolia

put the achievements of the season, and the past four years
in perspective. "I've had a great four years here. It was
awesome to see the program grow. When I was a freshman,
Swarthmore was considered a sure win like Bryn Mawr,
but over the past few years, we've proven we are a team to
be taken seriously. The two other seniors who graduated
with me [McCaffrey and Rogers] have been great to play
with. The friendships we've had has been awesome. I'm

definitely gonna miss being on the field with them and
with the rest of the team," Salussolia said.

MLB's free agency: curse or gift?
From LOYALTY, pg. 20
Nomar to free up money for their other four free agents in
2004 epitomizes what is wrong with the game today. The
owners control the team, and fan input is nonexistent.
As an Orioles fan, I was fortunate to witness first-hand
a rarity in today's world of free agency: a classy player,
Cal Ripken, who played his entire career with one team.
Rip knew the fans of Baltimore loved him and the ownership knew people came just to watch him play. It was a
match made in heaven. Berra, Mantle, DiMaggio,
all players who
Robinson, Gehrig, Koufax, Ripken
spent their careers with one team. There is no player
today who we will be able to add to the list.
Free agency has put the emphasis of the game of base-

ball squarely on money. Though this may overwhelmingly benefit players, the fans no doubt suffer due to outrageous contracts, skyrocketing ticket prices and ridiculously expensive concessions. Moreover, fan loyalty
toward players no longer exists. Mike Mussina used to be
my favorite player; after he bolted town for more money
from the rival Yankees, I now actively root against the
Moose.
I am not advocating the elimination of free agency. It is
certainly here to stay. As much harm as it has done for the
game, however, a new element of excitement exists.
Thanks to free agency, the promise of hope looms this offseason for the Orioles. So long as they sign a couple bigname free agents this winter, you won't here me complaining anymore come April.

NFL predictions: the
good, bad and ugly
OK, so not much has happened in the sports world in the last
few weeks. OK, that's not quite true. The NHL and NBA seasons
both started. Miami lost to Virginia Tech, shaking up college football. Midnight Madness occurred, making me pine again for olde
Tobacco Road. But none of these events really struck a chord with
me. The debuts of Leßron and
Carmelo and the return of Kobe
were all mildly interesting, but only
for the first 15 minutes or so. My
Bullets are likely going to be bad
(though I secretly think they'll be
better than most people expect) and
my Capitals are definitely going to
be bad. I'm not a big college football
fan, as a consequence of not having
grown up following a team. And
while I am a huge college basketball
fan, I, like Allen Iverson, generally
prefer games over practices.
So I shall instead devote the
remaining
450 to 600 words of this
WHARTON
BEN
column to assessing the football season at its exact midpoint. And by
assessing the football season, I
mean assessing the predictions I
made in my first Phoenix column
ever. Looking back with the wisdom of experience upon the whimsy of youth, I see that my first column had parts that were, to paraphrase a hackneyed cliche, good, bad and ugly.
I'll start with the bad. Even by my own modest standards, my
first column was not a soaring pinnacle of editorial journalism. In
my own defense, it was hard to write a meaningful, humorous,
poetic sports opinion piece within the space limitations while writing at least one sentence on every NFL team. (Except one. Sharp
readers who know which one, start a conversation with me to win
a prize.) So a lot of my sentences were along the lines of "The
Redskins are a joke" or "The Ravens will win." Both of those sentences are true, but neither one is poetic (except the second one).
Moving on to the ugly, a few of my NFL playoff picks aren't looking so hot eight weeks later. Probably the ugliest is my picking the
Jacksonville Jaguars to make the playoffs after calling them a
"dark horse." I wish I could say I meant dark as in the inside of a
glue factory and not dark as in the color of a metaphorical horse
that will do better than expected, but alas, I can't. Over in the NFC,
I'm in a similar ditch with the Atlanta Falcons. Although I guess I
was somewhat off the hook there, as I was working under the
assumption that Michael Vick would only miss four games, as was

90% Half Mental

originally predicted by team doctors, not eight or more.
But enough stomping on the grapes of wrath. Some
nay many
of my predictions were remarkably prescient, if I may so much
as toot my own horn. Of the 12 teams I predicted to go to the play-

offs, ten hold records of at least .500, and eight would make the
playoffs if the season were to end right now. I'm even prouder of
the fact that I decisively predicted some of the so-called surprise
teams, like the Seahawks and Panthers (though not the Cowboys or
Vikings). And I'm prouder yet that I called some collapses and disasters. Jeff Garcia's health has been an issue at San Francisco, the
Buccaneers have underachieved in defense of their championship,
the Steelers do indeed suck, and the Raiders have indeed looked
like my grandparents' retirement community flag football team.
But I think what I'm proudest of is kicking some Sports
Illustrated ass. Of the 12 teams they picked, only five would make
the playoffs if the season ended today. Five! One less than half! It
just so happens I'm also beating ESPN's John Clayton (six teams
making the playoffs right now), Len Pasquarelli (seven teams), Joe
Theismann (six), Merril Hoge (seven), Marc Golic (seven), Mel
Kiper, Jr. (seven), Andrea Kremer (seven), Randy Mueller (six),
Sean Salisbury (six), Mark Schlereth (six), Chris Berman (five),
Trey Wingo (seven), and Eric Allen (six). In fact, of the 16 ESPN
football personalities whose playoff predictions were published at
beating me, and only the cagey trio of
ESPN.com, none of
Sal Paolantonio, Ron Jaworski and Tom Jackson are matching me
with eight teams. Regrettably, Rush Limbaugh's predictions were
nowhere to be found.
So what does all this rubbish mean? It means that, in fact, I rule.
I rule more than Sports Illustrated and I rule more than ESPN. It
also means, however, that there is still ample time for the football
gods to melt my wings of wax and send me hurtling back towards
the briny depths of poor writing and the Jacksonville Jaguars.
Who knows. Maybe Sal Paolantonio will indeed have the last laugh.
That would truly be my darkest hour.

Katherine Athanasiades helped lead the Tide to a come-from-behind victory over the F&M Diplomats.

Garnet finish game and
season on positive note
BY ALEX KALKSTEIN
akalkstl@swarthmore.edu
Swarthmore field hockey ended the season with
an impressive comeback victory over the Franklin
and Marshall Diplomats, a nationally ranked team
in the first half of the season. The Garnet trailed 21 at the half but came back with two goals in the
second half to notch its seventh and final win of the
season. Lauren Sippel 'O5, off an assist from Chloe
Lewis 'O6, scored the game-winning goal with just
12 minutes remaining in the match.
Emily
Szydlowski 'O5 and Chelsea Ferrell 'O5 also contributed goals to lead the Garnet to victory. The
Garnet end their season 7-11 overall, 4-6 in the con-

ference.
A talented Diplomat team, fueled by Lindsey
Mummert, scored the first goal on an assist from
teammate Megan Short. As soon as Swarthmore
responded with a goal of its own, F&M fired back
with a goal by Eileen Keever right before the end of

the first half.

Head coach Kelly Wilcox was highly impressed
by the team's performance throughout the game,

but she singled out the team's efforts at the end of
the game. "[The team] held strong against a barrage of offensive corners by Franklin and Marhsall
in the final seconds of the game." Wilcox said, "not
to mention the fact that they did it on a grass field
at an away site, against a team that was ranked in
the top 20 for the first half of the season." She
admitted that the season had its challenges, namely "the team had to adapt to a lot of things this year
a new surface, a new schedule and a very young
team, with seven seniors lost to graduation."
Coach Wilcox acknowledged the determination
and selflessness of the team members. "All along
they did so without complaints, excuses or regret,"

November 6, 2003

she said.
Goalkeeper Karen Lorang 'O7 helped to restrain
the offensive fury coming from Franklin and
Marshall with eight saves in the second half.
Lorang 'O7 believed that "not only did we win, we
played well."
"Our team had trouble earlier, but we fought
back from being down at halftime, closing the season with a shot out half," she said.
Charlotte MacAusland 'O6 was happy with the
effort she saw out on the field. "We came back from
behind, scored on corners which was huge for us,
and our goals were scored by three different players. I'm really glad we got to give the seniors such
a memorable last game because they deserve it,"
she said.
Lewis added that "The game was a good way to
end the season. We were able to come back but we
finished the game with three defensive corners,"
she said. "We also were able to block three offensive
corners to finish the game ahead. Things that had
not happen earlier in the season came together in
our final game."
Heidi Fieselmann 'O6 said the team "really
clicked, working hard to get the ball in the cage. We
played with all out intensity, heart and determination."
Jessie Whitfield 'O6 found a connection between
the way the team's final game unfolded and the rest
of the season. "[The game] really was the story of
our season. [F&M] scored first in first half, but we
came back and prevailed. It seemed like it was the
only way we could end our season fittingly. We
weren't going to let this one go."
Women's field hockey seems poised to continue
these improvements into the 2004 season, if they
learrt from the mistakes and augmentthe successes
learned.

Garnet Tide avenge losses to Haverford
BY EMILY CONLON AND DERRICK WU

econlonl@swarthmore.edu, dwul@swarthmore.edu

The women's volleyball team literally danced off the
court last Wednesday evening at the end of its final season
match. For the first time since the 1995 season, the Garnet
Tide dominated Blue Line rival Haverford 3-2 (27-30, 24-30,
30-20, 30-20, 15-8), putting ah end to the 14-match losing

streak held

by Swat.
The Garnet entered the match with a 13-16 record, posting a 4-5 record in conference play and a 0-2 record against
Haverford. In its previous two meetings, Swarthmore fell
3-2 to the Fords at the Seven Sisters tournament in October
and 3-0 at the Richard Stockton tournament in September.
The team was excited for a rematch and was clearly the
underdog in the eyes of conference volleyball followers.
But the team saw the match as an opportunity to prove to
the conference that they had improved from last season.
"We were very prepared," Erica Newton 'O5 said. "Our
whole practice the day before was defense. Everyone
expected Haverford to win. We were definitely ready for
them," she said.
Haverford stole the first and second matches from the
Garnet, putting the Tide one loss away from the end of the
season. Krista Spiller 'O6 knew the game wasn't going to
end there. "We were down 0-2 and we really weren't ready
to end the season there. Everyone was thinking, 'Either we
play well or our season is over,' Spiller said.
Co-Captain Natalie Dunphy 'O5 agreed. "I wasn't too
worried. I knew that we came to play," she said.
In the third match, the Tide found their offensive
groove and banged many irretrievable balls at the Fords
defense. Co-Captain Emma Benn 'O4 knew it was her
Senior Night, and she lead the team with 20 kills. Dunphy
noticed the determination in Benn's play. "Her first three
hits were kills. The team in generally played with an
urgency, knowing it was our seniors' last games," she
said.
Dunphy and Katrina Morrison 'O4 combined for seven

Dunphy agreed. "I think it's a huge springboard into
next season. Whenever you see a team win against a'big
rival, it kind of opens everyone else's eyes."

where it went on an 8-2 run, and never looked back.

Up-and-coming Garnet proud of season
BY ALEX RYAN-BOND
aryanbol@swarthmore.edu

The men's soccer team finished the season in disappointing fashion last week, falling to Centennial Conference
rivals Ursinus and Haverford 2-0. They finished 12-2 (3-6
CC), capping off an up and down year for the Garnet Tide.
While Swarthmore did not manage to make the playoffs,

the team still had what it considers a successful season, in
which it knocked off nationally ranked Johns Hopkins at
home and also posted its best record in the CC in years,
including last year's winless record in the CC. "I think our
general skill level improved a lot this year," defenseman
Alex Elkins 'O6 said. "The freshmen were also important
this year and helped us a lot with our depth, and we were
also more intense and showed a lot more heart."
"The win over Hopkins was also crucial, because we had
a lot of recruits at that game, and it was impressive to see us
in that game compared to where we were last year," he said.
"Going from 0-9 to 3-6 in the conference is a huge step, and
our program appears much better now."
Last week, Haverford jumped on top of Swarthmore
early, scoring six minutes into the game and adding another goal before the half to put the team down for good.
Swarthmore's play was characterized by sluggish defense
and an inability on offense against the equally matched
Haverford squad. "We basically came out pretty flat in the
first half," goalkeeper Nate Shupe 'O5 said. "They dominated us in the first half, and we were missing some of our
main defenders in Elkins and David Hoyt, so that made it
tough. In the second half, we basically had a lot of opportunities that we couldn't capitalize on, and being down 2-0 at
that point doesn't help either."
The Tide also played conference rival Ursinus last
Wednesday, falling to the Bears 2-0 in what was Ursinus's
first conference win of the season. The Bears managed to
score on two key defensive lapses by Swarthmore, the
gamewinner on a penalty shot and the insurance goal on a
breakaway in the second half. "The penalty shot was my
fault," Shupe said. "I cheated out a bit, and he bent the ball,

so its tough to stop those shots once you've cheated out,

and plus I didn't communicate well enough with my
defenders, so that's why there was even a shot in the first
place," he admitted. "But overall, I thought we played pretty well and were definitely quite intense, but that we just
couldn't score or take advantage of the opportunities we
had."

November 6, 2003

Only one senior on the squad will graduate this year,
captain and premier midfielder Brendan Moriarty 'O4.
Twenty-two players are planning to return to next year's

team. "We should be good next year, and we're going to be
keeping the core of our team together," first-year midfielder Matt Schiller 'O7 said. "We should be able to really build
on the accomplishments of this past season."

Where the loyalty?
Ty Cobb once said, "Before it was ever a business, it
was a game." He uttered those words over four score

ago, acknowledging even in the early part of the 20th
century that baseball was a business and no longer a
game. The owners, Cobb felt, were ruining baseball.
Before free agency, teams owned players. If these
players wanted to opt out of their contracts or felt they
were being underpaid, they had no choice other than
play or sit out the season. Trades occurred
for example, Babe Ruth in 1918
but player off-season signings
with other teams were nonexistent. Owners often treated players with little respect, knowing the players had
no choice but to return. Following Mickey Mantle's
extraordinary 1957 season (which was even better than
his 1956 Triple Crown

campaign),

Yankees
owner Del Webb had
the audacity to ask
Mantle for a $5,000 pay
cut.

Mantle, in dire
straits,
refused. Mantle, however, was forced to
accept a $lO,OOO pay cut
after a "subpar" 1960
season; he responded

Association from the

mid-1960s into the 1980s, Miller was the man who
fought for and eventually won the idea of free agency.
We hear about free agency all the time. A-Rod's $250
million contract was the product of free agency, as are
other bloated contracts like Derek Jeter's and Manny
Ramirez's. But is free agency good for the game?
Free agency has added a new dynamic to baseball; it
has made the game more exciting. More off-season
acquisitions take place, and the fans become more intimately involved in team management happenings. One
could argue free agency adds parity amongst the clubs.
By allowing all teams to bid for top-tier free agents, one
team with a-wealth of talent is essentially guaranteed
to lose one of its top players once they file for free
agency because they can't afford to have him stay (case
in point: Theo Epstein's Boston Red Sox). One obvious
problem, however, is that the team with the deepest
checkbook simply outbids all the others.
The major problem I find with free agency, however, is loyalty. Since its inception in the mid-19705, free
agency has offered players the lucrative choice to
switch teams or often take a "hometown" discount to
continue playing for their current team. Why should a
player remain in a city for $25 million less than another team is offering him? It makes economic sense for
players to move around as frequently as they do. If
owners don't want to show commitment to the players
by offering them their supposed market value, then
why should players show commitment to the owners?
Money has soured baseball. Owners are more concerned with running the team as a business making a
profit instead of as a franchise winning pennants.
Many owners refuse to spend substantial money keeping the players that are the reason for their team's success. This is also difficult for fans, who come to love
certain players only to see them depart after what is
often their most productive year, the season before free
agency where the player wants to put up the best numbers possible to impress other teams. Fans try to show
loyalty to certain players, but owners make this impossible. If owners are so hell-bent on making money, why
let the team's most popular player, who puts fannies in
the seats, walk away at the end of the year? When players sign elsewhere, you hear the same thing year in
and year out: "The fans were great, but the team didn't
want to show me the commitment I deserve." The fact
that the Red Sox are even contemplating trading

The Swarthmore men's and women's cross country
teams set the Centennial Conference Championship
course on fire last Saturday. The men's team finished
third in the championship race, matching its highest
CC finish ever, while the women repeated last year's
fourth- place finish.

Elizabeth Gardner 'O5 and Debbie Farrelly 'O6 paced
the worhen's team last Saturday. Running together
throughout the race and pushing each other in the end,
the pair finished 10th and 11th out of a total of 97 runners. Their performances helped secure not only the
team's fourth place finish but also individual AllConference Honors for the two promising young harriers.

Head coach Peter Carroll was impressed by the performance of his entire team, and, in particular, the

impressive

11th place finish by rookie Farrelly.
"Debbie really stepped it up in the race. She came out
strong this season as a rookie and battled between basketball and cross country training these past few
weeks but was able to pull out a great finish. The fact
that she and Elizabeth made All-Conference Honors
was very exciting," Carroll said.
Carroll also said the women's team did exceptionally well considering that they missed senior Maria
Elena Young. Last year, Young placed third overall at
the CC Championships.
The other top finishers for the women's team were
Njideka Akunyili 'O4, Caroline Ritter 'O6 and Pam
Davis 'O7. They placed 27th, 33rd and 42nd, respectively. Davis, another rookie, has consistently placed in
Swarthmore's scoring five. Not only has coach Carroll
commented on her improvement, but her teammates
have also seen her potential.
"As far as 6K races go, Pam definitely had a better
race this weekend, and that is the product of hard work
[and] dedication," Gardner said. "She will be one to
November 6,

2003

watch in the next race and in the future."
The members of the men's cross country team will
also be ones to watch in the next race and next season.
This season's team has no seniors and will therefore
welcome back all of the runners next season, hopefully
to improve its third-place finish from last weekend.
The star of the race was junior Lang Reynolds who
was the 11th CC Champion. He placed first out of 94
runners in the 8K race. His win also earned him the CC
Men's Cross Country Runner of the Year award. Lang
is the first CC Champion in Swarthmore's history.
"Lang's win was great. We knew that he was a player
someone with great potential to win," Carroll
said. "He ran a smart race, stuck with the team's plan,
picking off one at a time, which let him work his way
up to the front of the pack. First place depended on who
ran the smartest race and that was Lang."
Juniors James Golden 'O5 and Garrett Ash 'O5, and
sophomores Jim Kreft 'O6 and Keefe Keeley 'O6 rounded
out the men's top five in the Centennial race. Golden
and Ash placed 16th and 17th, followed by Kreft in 22nd
and Keeley in 42nd.
"If a second star of the race is named it would have
to be Jim Kreft," coach Carroll said. "His 22nd-place
finish synched the deal
leaving us in third."
Coach Carroll also commented that Golden and Ash
were only about five seconds away from receiving AllConference Honors in the race. "It is kind of bittersweet that had happened because they both ran great
races and five seconds is very little in a race that takes
over 25 minutes to run."
Overall, Carroll was pleased with the runs of both
the men's and women's teams. He made it clear that the
course was difficult, because the "unseasonably warm,
wet course made it a challenge for the Swarthmore
runners." But they were all able to leap over the obstacles that the weather presented to finish strong at the
top.
The next race will be the NCAA Division 111
National Championships on Nov. 15
