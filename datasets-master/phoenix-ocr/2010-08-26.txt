Rebecca Chopp speaks to the gathered campus community at her inauguration in early May.

BY JACQUELINE SMALL

jsmall2@swarthmore.edu

Lucretia Mott, one of Swarthmore's
founders, would have been happy to
attend President Rebecca Chopp's inauguration.
Not only is Chopp an accomplished

scholar and administrator, her official
induction as the college's first female
president this May was a clear victory
for Mott's vision of equal rights.
The weekend of the inauguration was
marked by a symposium of professors
and alumni who spoke on panels about
civil discourse and sustainable living.
Alumni and faculty also participated
in arts performances and readings at a
program on Friday evening called, "A
Celebration
of
Community:
Performances in Honor of Rebecca
Chopp's Inauguration as 14th President
of Swarthmore College." Many of them
attended the ceremony itself, as did
Swarthmore students, and representatives from neighboring institutions
such as Haverford, Bryn Mawr,
University
of Pennsylvania
and
Widener University.
One of the six speakers at the ceremony was the provost of the college,
Constance Hungerford, who spoke of
Chopp's merits as an individual.
"We hail you especially as a fellow
scholar, who brings a distinguished
record of ground-breaking research in
feminism and theology, a pursuit of
inquiry and writing that you have sustained even through the distractions of
administrative responsibility at Emory,
and then the Yale Divinity School and,
finally, at Colgate," she said.
Nathaniel Erskine 10, who served a
term last year as StuCo vice president,
gave a speech at the inauguration praising Chopp's accessibility to students.
"President Chopp [is] an attentive
and reflective listener. She continually

NEWS IN BRIEF

Egg vandals plauge Borough of Swarthmore
Over the summer, the quiet town
of Swarthmore was hit with a series
of vandalism attacks.
According to the police report,
between July 27th and August 3rd,
various residents reported vandals
armed with eggs, water balloons
and pellet guns attacking houses,
homes, and in some cases, individuals.
The incidents, which were committed during the late evening and
early morning hours, occurred at
Harvard and Yale Avenues, the 300
block of N. Princeton Avenue, the
400 block of Drew Avenue, the 600
block of Yale Avenue, the 200 block
of Cornell Avenue, the 400 block of
Harvard Avenue, the 200 block of
Yale Avenue, the 300 block of South
Chester Road and the unit block of
South Chester Road, according to
the police report.
Police have obtained a vehicle
description and possible license
plate number from one of the incidents and are actively investigating
the crimes.
Despite these cases of vandalism,
Swarthmore has consistently had a
crime rate below the national average, with 52% fewer occurrences of
property crime per person, 53%
fewer occurrences of violent crime,
and 52% fewer occurrences of total
crime, in 2008.

August 26, 2010

Still, the police report cautions
that while some may see these incidents as "harmless pranks," they
are "dangerous activities that could
cause injury."
They add that "Persons identified committing these offenses will
be charged to the fullest extent of
the law."
Swarthmore borough manager
Jane Billings said that she did not
know of the vandalism cases before
hand, but considers Swarthmore a
fairly safe town.
When asked how vandalism
affects the borough, she said that
the incident "affects somebody if
they're [directly] affected by them,
but not the borough as a whole."
When asked whether measures
should be taken to prevent future
cases, Billings said that such measures will be taken only if they are
recommended by the police depart:
ment, which does not report to the
borough directly.

The Chief of Police of the
Swarthmore Police was on vacation
and unable to be reached at the time
of publication.
"I would completely defer to the
police on that. If they had a problem
and they thought it was necessary,
they would bring it to the Borough,"
said Billings.

Maintenance,

trash that others had left
behind. Party remnants were a
few bottles that students could
take care of.
But it was toward the end
that the mess had accumulated
to a much higher degree, especially in the kitchen.
Cho recalled that in the
excitement of leaving, students
had neglected to wash the dishes they had used with their previous care. They had also failed
to clean up the free food that
had been scattered in the ML
kitchen for all to take and eat.
"I understand why our
deposits weren't refunded,"
said Doug Woos 'll, another
summer
resident.
"Both
kitchens were extremely dirty,
and I don't envy the EVS people
who were tasked with cleaning
up the mess. Most people have
the common sense to clean up
after themselves, especially
when the space is shared with
so many other students, and
most people did a pretty good
job; a few specific individuals
were responsible for the
Chernobyl in the kitchens."
The kitchen had been
strewn with food scraps, leaving the area "filthy with rotting food." The refrigerators
were in equally "filthy" condition.
Maloney commented on the
state of the mess, saying that
she worked alongside the EVS
staff in cleaning rotting food
from three of the refrigerators
in particular because she
"could not leave [the EVS staff
members] to this disgusting
task alone."
In addition to the mess in
the kitchen, the hallways and
dorm rooms were filled with
trash as well.
Maloney said that, clean up
involved taking out countless
bags of trash and that the floor
was a sticky mess. As a collective mess, the situation at ML
took far longer to take care of
than a normal residence hall
clean up.
The summer coordinators
had repeatedly reminded students to clean after themselves.
Cho recalled Maloney sending
occasional messages when the
trash level seemed to be
increasing. The summer coordinators had also recognized
the RA's effort in informing
everyone about consistently
cleaning up their rooms and
the kitchen and the fact that
not all contributed directly to
the mess.
However, they noted that
the situation was a result of
collective action.
"I understand that not
everyone contributed to the
mess," said Maloney. "But it is

the summer and so everyone is

Environmental
Services
Technicians and numerous
other summer program coordinators were greeted with a
messy kitchen and trash-filled
hallways when they visited
Mary Lyons dorm on Monday,
August 9.
Maintenance and EVS
Technicians called on Rachel
Head, assistant dean for residential life, and Patti. Shields,
director ofenvironmental services, after having gone through
weeks of gradually deteriorating conditions in the off-campus dorm. Director of Summer
Programs
and
Facilities
Coordinator Patricia Maloney
had already been surprised by
ML's lobby conditions when
she made a brief visit on
Saturday. But Maloney said
that Monday's scene was "completely unacceptable."
The incident incurred some
serious consequences. None of
the 87 summer residents in ML
were refunded their $5O security deposits.
This penalty was especially
unpopular with those who
claimed 'not guilty.' They were
just as taken aback by the accumulated mess as maintenance
and EVS staff had been. They
sent remarks and comments
through e-mail as insider
explanations of what had happened and also as replies to
what they felt about being
penalized for the mess. Xingda
Zhai 'l3 said in an e-mail that
many students had left early,
and that the mess had been
made after their departure.
Other students remarked on
how they had unwillingly contributed to the final trash
buildup due to circumstances
at the time.
"There was no cleaning by
staff in the last few days, which
rendered all other cleaning
impossible," summer resident
Benjamin Yesley 'll said in an
e-mail. "By Friday, every trash
bin in ML was overflowing,
and the halls were congested
with things that no one in ML
would ever want to claim. I was
totally unable to dispose of
trash in any civilized way, and
ended up putting more refuse
on the floor, or leaving it in my
room, because there was literally no better place to put it."
ML conditions had apparently not been too bothersome,
at least until the last couple of
days. Daniel Cho 'l3, one of the
summer residents, said that
any mess that might have been
made during the initial period
had not been too extreme as to
alert the EVS staff. There had
been students who constantly
cleaned the kitchen and the responsible."

Former Rep. Tom DeLay heading for jury trial, judge rules
BY NOLAN HICKS
DAILY TEXAN, AUG. 25

A Travis County district judge ruled
Tuesday the long-standing saga over allegations Tom DeLay laundered" money to
fund Republican candidates running for
the Texas House during the 2002 election
will go to trial.
Judge Pat Priest, who was specially
appointed to the case, ruled that DeLay
would receive a trial ahead of two codefendants but he won't rule until today
on whether a change of venue should be
granted.
"I think we need to try Mr. DeLay
first," Priest said. "[DeLay] has been
demanding trial since day one and he's
going to get it."
The judge also rejected several defense
motions to dismiss charges against
DeLay and his co-defendants based on
prosecutorial misconduct.
The pre-trial hearings began at 9 a.m.

and lasted into the late afternoon, but
DeLay appeared confident. He insisted to
reporters during a break in proceedings
that he would be proven innocent of
money laundering and conspiracy to
launder money but said that he would not
receive a fair trial in Travis County.
"This is a political maneuver by a
rogue district attorney [Former Travis
County District Attorney Ronnie Earle],"
he said. "And if I had gotten my trial
speedily, like I think I'm entitled to, I
may still be in Congress and I may still be
in the leadership of Congress."

The Texas charges were brought by
Earle, who was investigating if $190,000
in corporate campaign contributions
donated to DeLay's Texas political action
committee, laundered through the RNC
and then donated to seven Republican
candidates running in Texas House races,
was in violation of Texas' ban on corporate contributions to candidates running
for state office. It was also revealed
recently that the Justice Department had
concluded its probe into the relationship
between DeLay and former lobbyist Jack
Abramoff, who plead guilty to charges of
corrupting public officials in 2006. A congressman, two White House officials from
the Bush administration and two of
DeLay's congressional aides were among
those convicted of accepting bribes from
Abramoff.
He said he wouldn't have done anything differently to prevent the appearance of impropriety that triggered a sixyear federal probe into his ties with
Abramoff and indictments in Texas.
"I don't think there's enough money in
politics," DeLay said. "Money is corruptible to the corruptible, it is up to the individual. There is nothing wrong with participating in the process and [raising
money to help] candidates get elected. I'm
not ashamed of anything I've done."
Charges against DeLay in the
Abramoff inquiry were dropped last
week by the Department of Justice.
Priest quickly ruled on a motion from
DeLay's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, that he

should be tried separately from two codefendants, James Ellis and John
Colyandro. Ellis was DeLay's chief Texas

and ran Americans for a
Majority Political Action
which Texans for a
Committee,
Republican Majority was modeled after.
Colyandro was selected by DeLay and
Ellis to run TRMPAC.
After ruling that DeLay's trial should
proceed separately, Priest heard a series
of motions from defense lawyers to dismiss the charges.
The judge heard arguments in closed
because of discussions about
session
after lunch on the
grand jury material
legitimacy of Earle's use of three grand
juries to obtain an indictment of the former congressman. DeLay's lawyer,
DeGuerin, said before the closed session
that after failing to obtain an indictment
from one grand jury, Earle used a newly
installed panel that produced the indictRepublican

ment.

"The defense is standing in a very
deep hole with a very short stick, but I
don't want to preclude them from presenting their case," Priest said after hearing a series arguments alleging prosecu-

torial misconduct.
DeLay said he didn't expect a favorable ruling from the judge on the issue of
prosecutorial misconduct, but that the
important thing was putting the question
on the record, so that it could be appealed
and challenge the Travis County District
Attorney's authority.

"What's

important here

is to make the

case and put it on the record because
there will be other things coming down
the pike when it's all done," DeLay said.
The judge also heard arguments on
whether Earle and current District
Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg had
biased the potential jurors by speaking
with the press.
The judge ruled against several
motions to dismiss the charges Tuesday
and indicated that he's likely to reject the
others today.
"They would liked to have* the indictments dismissed but they were not," said
UT law professor Steve Bickerstaff, who
attended the hearing. "The impression
that was conveyed today is that Judge
Priest is ready to go to trial."
DeLay's lawyer will argue today that
he cannot get a fair trial in Austin
because of his role in the controversial
2003 mid-cycle redistricting ofTexas' congressional map.
"Everybody knows that Travis County

is the last bastion of liberalism in the
state of Texas and that everyone who
lives in Austin either belongs to an
organization or is politically motivated
one way or another and knows what's
going on because they talk to each other,"
DeLay said. "We will present our case to
the judge. There's no way I can get a free
and fair trial in this county."
After the hearing was adjourned at 5
p.m., DeGuerin said the case was probably moving forward to trial phase.
"It's just a matter of when and where,"
he said.

Pig Iron, a previous recipient of seven'

noise with "Welcome to Yuba City." The production was the highest attended show last-summer
at the 2009 Live Arts Festival in Philadelphia,
while simultaneously selling out 14 shows.
The ensemble created a comical portrayal of
the American West. Pig Iron's production process
is an "open beginning." which means there is an
initial sense of the work's setting, but a script and
characters are absent. Bauriedel said. "Every
time we are making something from scratch, the
challenges are trying to follow what's exciting in
the rehearsal room."
Each actor imagined his or her own characters
using the director's initial concept of the
American West "Everyone in the ensemble was
absolutely stunning. One of the pleasures of the
play was watching the actors transform into these
widely different and interesting characters,"
Bauriedel said.

What She's Wearing:
Cannizzaro's jacket is from a London thrift store and
she found her black, newspaper-boy cap at a hat shop in
Japan. "I love these shoes," Cannizzaro said of her tan
oxfords; which she found in Swarthmore's famous little
costume shop. "I liked the shoes so much and they fit so
perfectly, the teacher said 1 could keep them!" Her knee
high socks are from Target* a Swarthmore student made
her shirt, and her navy knit skirt is American Apparel,
which she paired with an Urban Outfitter's necklace
and her mother's vintage leather purse.
.
It's an outfit of basic cdlors, but Cannizzaro finds the
perfect look for the transition from summer to fall, with'
the short, summery lengths of her skirt to the jacket,
knee highs and oxfords rounding out the look for fall.
Her outfit also hits the runway mark, as it was definitely back to basics for Fall 2010 collections like Celine,
Marc Jacobs and Stella McCartney (the former two
being Cannizzarro's favorite designers).

Getting to and from Philly: the Liberty Bell by train
&

.

swarthmorephoenix.com

Welcome to Swarthmore. If you're not from the
area, when you say you go
to Swarth-more and the
person you've informed
asks, "Where's that?" you
probably
reply,
"Philadelphia." And if you
say
Philadelphia,
the
chances are they'll say, "So,
have you seen the Liberty

Bell?"

By the end of the year,
Jen Johnson
be able to answer "Yes."
In-town, Off-campus ■
Swarthmore is about

eleven miles southwest of
the birthplace of the United
States. Depending on what
mode of transportation you take, what time of day, and
what day of the week it is, it takes between thirty-five
minutes and two hours to get downtown.
Driving and parking downtown can be expensive and
a hassle-however, taking a car into the urban center is a
problem most Swatties don't have. Most Swatties rely on
Transportation
the Southeastern Pennsylvania
Authority (SEPTA) via the Media-Elwyn Line (formerly
the R3), which stops at the foot of campus. Trains run
once an hour and more frequently during rush hours.
Schedules can be found on the SEPTA website
(www.septa.org), and the Student Dashboard lists the
arrival times of the next three inbound trains, which will
take you to Center City. Schedules and fares are subject
to change throughout the year, so a paper railway time
guide will not be accurate indefinitely. The organization's website lists service changes, but reportedly, the
most reliable way to get updates about service changes is
to subscribe to its Twitter feed.
The train is more likely to be late than early, but most
off-peak (non-rush hour) trains are punctual. Inbound
trains arrive on the platform nearest to the softball field,
next to the station office. Bring $l5 cash for the train fare.
After you board the train and it starts rolling, the conductor will come through and ask for, "All tickets and
passes." If you have purchased a ticket beforehand, slide
it into the black clip on the seat in front of you, and the
conductor will validate it as he passes through. Advance
fares are cheaper than onboard fares, and can be purchased at the station office Monday through Friday from
5:30 AM to noon. Currently, weekend and evening
onboard fares are the same as advanced purchase fares,
but weekday fares before 7:00 PM are more expensive
onboard ($12.00) than in advance ($10.75). If you buy your
ticket onboard, tell the conductor you'd like a round trip

ticket to Market East Station. You can also ask for a
round trip to Center City, which is the fare zone. Either
way, to get to the Liberty Bell, you should get off at
Market East. If the trains are moving well, it takes about
forty minutes to arrive.
Unfortunately, your train could arrive on any of several tracks within Market East, making the nearest exit a
variable factor. To get to your destination, make your
way up to the street and find a corner. Make a tour of the
block if necessary-if you do, you should see Reading
Terminal Market, a great place to grab lunch that is quite
a destination itself.
Ideally, you want to find yourself between the Hard
Rock Cafe on the corner of 12th & Market and the
Burlington Coat Factory on the corner of 10th & Market.
There should be an important-looking building with a
statue of William Penn on top down the street to your
right; this is City Hall.
If you have time, it's worth a look, but your destination is in the other direction. In Philadelphia, numbered
streets run roughly north-south, and named streets run
roughly east-west.

Walk away from City Hall on Market Street as the
numbered cross streets decline. At 6th and Market, the
scenery changes from urban jungle to small-and-wellmanicured national park, and you have arrived.
At the north end of the park between Race & Arch
Streets, the National Constitution Center is an interactive historical museum concerned with the birth of the
United States, open 9:30-5:00 Monday through Saturday
(open until 6 p.m. on Saturdays) and noon-5:00 on
Sundays. Adult admission is $l2. The Independence

Visitors' Center between Arch & Market is where many
different city tours begin, as well as the site of the nearest public restroom. The Liberty Bell and Independence
Hall are open daily 9 a.m. 5 p.m.. Tickets are required
March through December for Independence Hall, but can
be reserved by phone or online. Tickets are normally
free, but there is a $l5O per ticket surcharge for advance
reservations.
When you're ready to return to campus, reverse
course. Just make sure you've kept your train ticket. If
you feel likely to get lost, the weather turns out to be
awful, or walking from Market East to 6th & Market is a
hardship, the alternative to walking is to stay underground and change to the Market-Frankford Line (you
will have to pay again, though not so much) and ride it to
sth & Market. Unfortunately, SEPTA's rail system is not
particularly good at accommodating physical disabilities
-

affecting walking.
•

To call this area the historic part of Philadelphia does

not do justice to the city's life apart from its political significance to the creation of the nation.

Yet, it is the history of this area that exists in
American culture as the most popular idea of
Philadelphia. The trip to the Liberty Bell, Independence
Hall, and the National Constitution Center is not so simple that you couldn't get lost, or so quick that it only
requires you to set aside two or three hours. It is nevertheless a good first trip off campus. On the whole, it's a
safe and straightforward trip with a clear and significant
goal, and should you get lost downtown, it shouldn't be
hard to reorient yourself and get directions.

action-packed
film, an adapta-

tion of the Scott

Pilgrim graphic
novel series by
Bryan
Lee

O'Malley featuring
Michael
Cera, adds an anime and video gameinspired action element to spice up the
tale of an awkward teen in searh of
romance, which seemingly-typecast
Cera has already explored in numerous
films.
In Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Scott
Pilgrim (Michael Cera) encounters the
literal girl of his dreams, Ramona
Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead),
though he's dating high school student
Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). Once .he
finally gets Ramona to go on a date with
him, he finds that there is a League of

10

Ramona's Evil Exes out to get him. In
order to date Ramona, he must defeat all
of these exes.
The movie is presented as if it were a
video game. For each object and character there is a list of details as the viewer
scans and surveys parts of the room to
get a better feel for and ready immersion
into the world of the film, just as one
would when playing a role-playing video
game. This aide to immersion draws the
viewer into the film and the action never
slows, assuring that the viewer, whom
the film seems to assume has attention
deficit disorder, is never bored.
The fast and upbeat pace of Scott
Pilgrim vs. the World is refreshing and

movie. This innovative device ensures
that the viewer will pay attention and be
entertained.
Along the way, the themes of the
struggles of teenage love and romance
emerge throughout the film, making the
fun more than just sheer enjoyment but
also a poignant take on the genre. After
each battle, the trust of the couple of

some strange exes, Scott begins to question Ramona's character and their relationship begins to tear apart. It seems as
though the League has done its job. It is
only when Scott begins to learn selfrespect that he is able to look past
Ramona's flaws and accept their relationship enough to continue to fight for
its success. The film increases its meaningfulness by making comments on
romance and break-ups, and the importance of self-respect in creating lasting

relationships.

It is this combination of pure entertainment value and poignant, though

makes Scott Pilgrim a delight to watch

It takes a familiar genre, and adds a welcome flavor to the experience. The
action-packed fight scenes in which
Scott Pilgrim uses advanced martial arts
and acrobatics expands on the awkward
teen type-cast in which Cera is
entrapped, making him as much an
action hero as an awkward nerdy hipster. The innocence and nonchalance by
which the character of Scott Pilgrim can
traverse between the tropes of the nervous teen who is squeamish around girls
and those of the the martial arts guru

adds to the humor of the film that
charms the audience into getting behind
Scott Pilgrim as he battles for a love that
he respects and in which he believes.
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is one of
those summer hits that proves to be a
total entertainment experience. In
blending the pleasing aspects of teenage

Bridging social commentary and cheap entertainment
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY QUITTERIE GOUNOT
qgounotl@swarthmore.edu

For many people, the words "pulp fiction" evoke a
very specific and immediate association: the 1994
movie by Quentin Tarantino. Both an example and a
parody of the film noir genre, Pulp Fiction immerses
the viewer into the fragmented yet interconnected

lives ofLas Vegas mobsters and small time criminals.
Fewer people, however, know about pulp fiction,
the genre which gave the famous film its name.
Perhaps it is the very nature of the genre that is to
blame. After all, pulp fiction is not the kind of literature that teachers like to pass out for students to
study. Known for their lurid stories, filled with gratuitous and explicit sex and violence, pulp magazines
are not exactly considered art. As students in 2010, is
there anything for us to learn from the cheap entertainment popular in the early part of last century?
This is a question that has been on the mind of
Hilary Trout 'l3 for some time and developed into the
current McCabe exhibit, "Sex, Action, and SocialCommentary: Pulp Magazines in America." Spanning
some eight cases all around the entrance and lobby of
the library, this exhibit brings together over thirty
specimens of the pulp fiction genre, and other original
documents such as letters concerning alleged copyright violations. This collection, donated to
Swarthmbre College by Philadelphian author David
H. Keller's family, includes many of his own stories.
However, the collection also features stories,
essays, and poems by a variety of other authors such
as John Murray Reynolds, H.P. Lovecraft, and Ray
Avery Myers. Visitors might be surprised to see mentions of famous literary figures like Ursula LeGuin
and Isaac Asimov. "Under the grim and grime of pulp,
you get some major household names," Trout said.
In fact, many well-known American writers of the
past century launched their literary careers that way.
For example, both Ray Bradbury and Tennessee
Williams published their first stories in pulp magazines.
Pulp fiction might seem out of place at an institution like Swarthmore, as it is first and foremost cheap
entertainment, deriving its name from the low-grade
wood pulp paper on which it was printed. With a varying but always low price, pulp magazines did not pretend to compete with the so-called classier entertainment of the "slicks," more expensive publications recognizable due to their glossy covers. The writing was
often amateur and almost always verbose because
writers were typically paid by the word. All the same,
it is precisely this commonplace quality that made the
pulps such a staple of American newsstands from
their appearance in the late 1890's to their decline in
the 1950'5.
"It was popular because it was cheap," Trout said.
"It was something everyone could afford, entertainment everyone had access to as long as they could
read or get someone to read it to them."
Beyond shockingly racist cover art and depictions
of scantily clad women, pulp fiction can be seen as a
vehicle for social and political ideas. Stories that
might strike us as profoundly sexist in their portrayal of gender roles are countered by many examples
more sympathetic to a feminist audience. Pulp fiction
encompasses views as diametrically opposed as
socialism and capitalism. The modern audience is
called to sift through and identify for him or herself
those ideas that are worthy. "The authors are beginning to work through questions like racism, sexism
and technological mayhem on the page, though not
always in ways progressive people would like to see,"
librarian Melanie Maksin said. "It's a medium that is
far out there in many ways, including socially and
politically."

As the exhibit makes clear, pulp fiction reflects the
prevalent anxieties of its time, such as the advent of
technological warfare, the excesses and inefficiencies
of governments, and the depletion of natural
resources. "The pulps were a small glimpse into what
was going on in the cultural subconscious," Trout
said.
Through the pulps, writers of all social origins,
professions, and political persuasions delivered a raw
bulk of stories and ideas. Much like Wikipedia today,
the pulp can be blamed for its inconsistent quality, the

12

"Sex, Action, and Social Commentary" is the newest McCabe exhibit covering the oft-hidden genre of pulp fiction
"anything and everything" that seem to make it up.
But it can be praised for its wonderful accessibility
and integration of popular involvement.
One thing is sure: the significance of pulp fiction

has been seriously overlooked.
"By showcasing our collections, we want students
to think about what else may be lurking in the
library," librarian Pam Harris said.

with different motivations.
If you ask them about their reasons for
applying to American educational institutions, some say "a good education," others
"a change of scenery," and a small group
does not even know.
As evidenced even in this small example, we, as the international students,
come from not only different countries but
also from different mind frames.
As a Turkish student from an
American school in Istanbul, I am here for
a number of reasons, the most important
of which is to have a multifaceted education. The European education system
expects students to make career plans
nearly as early as kindergarten and builds
up their education based on that decision
for the rest of their lives. An engineer
takes only technical and "necessary"
classes in college, missing out on a lot of
other subjects.
As opposed to the strict field education
in Europe, the American liberal arts education gives the student a broad understanding of life and the liberty to discover
new things that might be interesting. I can
be on the pre-med track and pursue my
interest in journalism while taking sociology classes at the same time.
What do you call freedom, if not that?
On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean,
we drew thick lines between academic
fields and stuck to them for our lives. But
how efficient is it to categorize students
based on their initial educational preferences and turn a blind eye on any other
field? Is it better to encourage students to
focus on a single study and ignore the rest?
Then, we end up with well-educated
doctors who do not even know how to com-

engineers who do not know anything
about the world issues. Those are the
unfortunate creations of the system.
At a personal level, I must add the
importance of the First Amendment, in
other words the freedom of speech. A journalist's biggest nightmare is probably censorship or the red pen. For different reasons, I have been struggling against the
red pen in the past few years.
In my high school newspaper, we could
not write opinion pieces about politics
because it is prohibited by the Ministry of
Education regulations. Therefore, the
completed issue was controlled by the
Dean of Students, and every now and then
we would publish the issue with a blank
space in a corner because an article
became the victim of the red pen.
After a point, any kind ofcritical article
was impossible to publish and it got really
frustrating. The newspaper was becoming
just an advertisement booklet where the
recent events on campus would be reported with as little criticism as possible.
When I realized that there was no way
of fighting the bureaucracy, I decided to
find a loophole in the system and utilize it.
I wanted to write about the negative effects
of the strong political polarity in Turkey.
The method I came up with was writing
an allegorical article using the chemical
polarity to portray polarity between the
Turkish political parties.
It fortunately passed the censorship
and became the first opinion piece to ever
be published in my high school. It was a
truly fulfilling experience, yet I believe

journalists should not need to struggle
with the restrictions to share their opinions. Agreeing or disagreeing is one thing;
prohibiting the share of ideas is another.
It has not even been a week since I
arrived at Swarthmore, but I am already
writing a column, sharing my experiences,
opinions, and ideas through the newspa-

per.

And most importantly, I do it without
any kind of restriction. On the contrary, I
am encouraged to share as much as possi-

ble. It is a generous opportunity, and I am

planning to use it as productively as I can.

one can think of. More, perhaps even most
importantly, is that there is absolutely no
connection whatsoever between being an
elite baseball player and occupying the hallowed ground reserved for "clutch" players.
***ln a nutshell: it takes'an aggregate
sum of all plays made by a given player
over the course of a season that adds to the
probability that his team will win a game
and subtracts from it a version of that sum
that takes into account how important the
given situation was in terms of winning the
game (i.e. batting with the bases loaded and
two outs in the ninth inning when losing by

Essentially, it shows how much better a
player performs in an important situation
compared to how he would in a less important one.
Just for fun, I took a look at the players
who have raised their game in the clutch
better than anyone else this year and put
their Clutch Ratings opposite Wins Above
Replacement (WAR), a statistic that determines a player's overall value (measured in
how many more theoretical wins that player would be worth to his team over the
course of a season than, were he injured,
the prototypical weak-offense/averagedefense free agent who would be available
to sign at a moment's notice). For reference,
4 Wins Above Replacement usually puts a
player in the top 25 in all of baseball, 3 in
the fop 40, and 2 in the top 80.
Here are the top 10 from the unfinished
2010 season:

To label someone a clutch
player is to ignore the big
picture. To deny the existence of Clutch is to
ignore the little one.

already, 15% jock
ex-ballplayers, and 5% Joe Morgan*.
The Stat Guys refuse to acknowledge
that which cannot be quantified, while the
other side is distrustful of data they see as
potentially misleading, preferring to go
entirely by what they see, which periodically involves someone who has the slightly ethereal ability to rise above human concerns such as pressure and perform regardless. Since seeing is, to them, believing, let's

call that side the True Believers. A little
heavy-handed? Absolutely, but take baseball out of the equation and the two opposing maxims here are simply "I know nothing that cannot be proven" and "I know
because I believe."
*The first thing you are taught when
being initiated into the statistical community is that at the end of the day, just about
everything is Joe Morgan's fault, oil, spills
and forest fires not excepted. Also, they
don't care how much he appears to dislike
playing baseball, J.D. Drew IS, in fact,
underrated.
What the Stat Guys have going for them
is that, while the stories about great
"clutch" moments in baseball have proven
endlessly repeatable, the supposed ability
to consistently perform "in the clutch" has
not. Enter Fangraphs.com. For those unfamiliar, Fangraphs has asserted itself as the
Mecca for Stat Guys everywhere a place
to analyze, debate, reason, conclude, rinse,
and repeat when it comes to baseball statistics**. This does not, however, mean that
they are satisfied to use only the categories
that have already been created. No, in addition to the usual sets of numbers you might
expect from a baseball-themed website,
Fangraphs has created several custom categories of its own. And in the ultimate middle finger to the True Believers, who stand
for nothing if not for the fact that you just
can't even begin to put a number on what

Top 10 "Clutch" Players, 2010

Yadier Molina, Cardinals C / 109 / 17
Placido Polanco, Phillies 3B / 101 / 3.5
Clutch Average: L4O
Wins Above Replacement Average: L 9
The Stat guys would be overjoyed to see
this list; a couple of excellent players, a couple of horrendous ones (you rarely see negative WAR ratings in the major leagues
since, as you might imagine, such players
would not normally be allowed to play in
the major leagues), but overall a mixed bag
that points to no specific trend. The average

player who is among the elite in the clutch
is a good if not spectacular player worth
about 2 wins to his team.
Here are the bottom-dwellers, the players who, in important moments, evidently
struggle to hold their bats correctly:
Bottom 10 "Clutch" Players, 2010
Player / Clutch / Wins Above Replacement
Rajai Davis, Athletics OF / -162 / 0.7
Ben Zobrist, Rays 2B / -159 / 2.7
Ryan Theriot, Dodgers IF / -150 / 0.2
Derrek Lee, Cubs IB / -139 / 11
Jayson Werth, Phillies RF / -134 / 3.5
Adrian Beltre, Red Sox 3B / -127 / 5.6
Cody Ross, Marlins OF / -126 / 16
Adam Jones, Orioles OF / -114 / 17
Carlos Gonzales, Rockies OF / -112 / 3.7
Alexei Ramirez, White Sox SS / -111 / 3.2
Clutch Average: -L33
Wins Above Replacement Average: 2.4

Again, nothing illuminating. If anything, the chokers appear to be better than
their Clutch counterparts, at least according to WAR. Beltre and Gonzales, in particular, are having outstanding seasons, and
would probably not be offered in exchanged
for Jose Lopez and Lastings Milledge. If,
however, that is too small of a sample size
for you, we can widen the picture a bit. Will
the Clutch rating, when its totals from the

last three seasons are added up, reveal any
patterns unto us?

Top 10 "Clutch" Players, 2008-2010
Player / Clutch / Wins Above Replacement
Carlos Lee, Astros OF / 3.68 / 5.2
Stephen Drew, Diamondbacks SS / 2.78 / 7.3
Raul Ibanez, Phillies OF / 167 / 4.0

Pedro Feliz, Cardinals 3B / 2.54 / 19
Ryan Howard, Phillies IB / 2.35 /. 9.6
Ichiro Suzuki, Mariners OF / 2.35 / 118
Chone Figgins, Mariners IF / 2.25 / 91
Michael Bourn, Astros OF / 195 / 6.4
Brian Roberts, Orioles 2B / 175 / 9.0
Jose Lopez, Mariners IF / 0.88 / 4.7
Clutch Average: 2.32
Wins Above Replacement Average: 7.2
Yeah....no. Carlos Lee, clutch as he evidently is, might just be the worst everyday
player in baseball right now, and he didn't
have to lower his game that much in order
to achieve that status. Perennial All-Stars
Ichiro and Howard muddle up the picture
even more, which is of course the whole
point. Some great players have happened to
perform in clutch situations over a given
period of time, but it is not repeatable or
consistent (both Lee and Howard, for example, have had multiple seasons with negative Clutch ratings). The same is true for
the mediocre and the terrible. Since we're
at it...

Bottom 10 "Clutch" Players, 2008-2010
Player / Clutch / Wins Above Replacement
Felipe Lopez, Cardinals IF / -3.97 / 5.6
Adrian Beltre, Red Sox 3B / -3.66 / 119
Luke Scott, Orioles, OF / -3.59 / 6.2
Troy Tulowitzki, Rockies SS / -3.45 / 10.2
Chris Young, Diamondbacks OF / -3.44 / 6.3
Jayson Werth, Phillies OF / -3.42 / 13.3
Matt Kemp, Dodgers OF / -2.94 / 8.8
Chase Utley, PhiUies 2B / -2.76 / 18.8
Brian McCann, Braves C / -2.66 / 14.0
Ryan Ludwick, Cardinals OF / -2.28 / 10.3
Clutch Average: -3.22
Wins Above Replacement Average: 10.5
Now this is getting ridiculous. By any
measurement, Utley has been one of the top
five players in baseball over the past three
seasons, and McCann, Tulowitzki and
Werth have all been excellent in their own
right.
Like I said above, and please note the
inherent caveat here, when judged by the
standards that have been attributed by one

August 26, 2010

side to what the other side claims cannot
be measured by any such standards...no,
there doesn't really seem to be any such
thing as a consistently "clutch" player, and
those who have posted impressive ratings
in that category do not necessarily belong
to baseball's elite.
And yet—and this is going to sound
crazy at this point in the column—is there
really any doubt in anyone's mind that
clutch players do exist? Is it possible to
watch an infielder who has fielded ten
thousand ground balls let one carom off of
his glove with the winning run on third
base and say that it doesn't take a little... well, something...extra to make that
play?
Do we have to watch one more batter
stand in the box as both the last out and the
tying run, looking like he would rather be
trapped in a car with Mike Tyson's pet
tiger than where he is right now, before we
acknowledge that this is not a quality that
every player possesses inside ofhimself? In
the end, the reason this argument will
never be resolved is because everyone—
Stat Guys and True Believers alike—is correct.
And yet, still they would have us believe
that their views are irreconcilable when
the truth is that they don't want them to be
reconciled. No, a baseball player cannot
come up with thirty-five consecutive hits
in high-leverage situations because baseball simply does not allow one to collect
thirty-five consecutive hits in any situa-

tion.
And yes, playing pop psychologist is
pointless, but we shouldn't need an introductory seminar with Professor of
Psychology Andrew Ward to see what is
right in front of our faces—that when the
chips are down, some players let it get to
them, so that it affects their performance.
And some don't. To label someone a
"clutch" player is to ignore the big picture.
To deny the existence of Clutch is to ignore
the little one.
As little as either side is interested in
hearing this, there happens to be room for
both of them.

Soccer ladies' ECAC title win voted "Moment of the Year"

to finish at number one, outdistancing
the men's soccer team's Sweet 16 berth
in the NCAA tournament, which finished second, and swimmer Travis

which finished third. Rounding out
the final five moments was the baseball team's victory over F&M to
secure a playoff spot and the men's
basketball team's victory over heavily

As if they were short on victories.
The Swarthmore women's soccer
team's ECAC (Eastern College
Athletic Conference) South Region
championship was voted "Moment of
the Year" for Swarthmore athletics in
the 2009-2010 season.
The title, which was clinched with
a 1-0 victory over PSU-Behrend on
November 15th of last year, was the
third straight for the Garnet, making

one of the most
lasting impressions from the
title run was the
resilience with
which his team

advantage.
Anckaitis pointed out that all three of
the team's title victories have
occurred on the road.
"Even though our energetic Swat
crowds haven't had the chance to be
there in person for some of [the
team's] most exciting accomplishments, we always feel that essence and
try to play with the extra boost they'd
give us if they should be there," said
Anckaitis.

during the 2009 season. To be able to

a time when we have so much energy,
is exciting."
The soccer team's success easily

On the season, the Garnet finished
16-4-1, peaking at Number 15 in the
rankings devised by the National
Soccer Coaches of America (NSCAA).
The 2009 season was also the first time
that the program was nationally
ranked for the entire year.
Anckaitis was quick to refute the
notion that the soccer team's phenomenal success over the past three seasons has created heavy expectations
going forward.

"Our past performance doesn't set
the expectations. We always set high
expectations of ourselves regardless of
past performances" Anckaitis said.
"Our successes just validate our plan,
the execution and work we put into
it."
The Garnet begin their third
straight title defense with the Swat
Kick Classic Tournament. The inaugural match takes place on Friday,
September 3rd against the Baptist Bible
Defenders. Kick-off is set for 7:00 p.m.
