Swarthmore Borough Council is considering a referendum on alcohol that would allow for a hotel on the college's current softball field.
The hotel is to the rear and left of the train station in this artist's rendering from the borough's 1999 revitalization task force report.

Borough vote on alcohol first step to hotel
By Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Phoenix Staff
Taking the first step in support of a
hotel on college land, the Swarthmore
borough council is hoping to legalize
retail sale of alcohol in the currently dry
in a strange irony
only
town, but
on college property.
Council members believe many
Swarthmore residents are in favor of
putting a hotel or inn within the borough.
And for such an establishment to be eco-

nomically viable, they said in interviews, it would need to serve alcohol.
Swarthmore has been dry since 1949,
when borough residents voted 1,111 to
55 to ban the retail sale of alcohol. Making the town wet again would require a
referendum next spring, but council
members said they fear the consequences of completely allowing the retail sale of alcohol.
"We do not want bars in Swarthmore,"
said council member Alice "Putty"
Willetts. "You have to be very, very care-

ful how you word this thing."
Because the Pennsylvania Liquor
Control Board regulates bars and taverns in the same category as restaurants, neither the borough nor the state
could prevent someone from buying a
liquor license and opening one.
That is because state regulators have
a loose definition of restaurant, said
council vice president Ann Seidman. "If
you have a pot of water and thirty hot

The Computing Services Committee is
cutting back the Internet bandwidthavailable for non-curricular activities, according to a campus-wide e-mail sent Friday.
Beginning in September, heavy users will
be asked to reduce their Internet activity
and will risk losing their network access
if they do not comply. The e-mail emphasized that thresholds would be high
enough so typical Internet usage such as
"sending e-mail" and "routine access to
Web pages" would not be affected.
"Colleges are being asked to subsidize
students' entertainment," said Manager of
Networking and Systems Mark Dumic,
"something they haven't traditionally
done."
Dumic blamed "a good part" of this
year's doubled traffic on student use of
Hotline and Napster software, which allow users to share software and digital
music files with others around the world.
The illegal transfer of copyrighted materials permitted by the two programs has
led dozens of colleges and universities to
ban Napster from their campus networks.
The committee considered and rejected a
proposal to institute a similar ban.
The policy is not meant to target intellectual property or copyright liability,
Dumic noted. "The issue we're trying to
address is not a content issue," he said.
"We're trying to conserve a scarce, costly
campus resource."
The Computing Center will collect usage data with a program produced by the
3Com Corporation called Traffix, designed to monitor bandwidth use and TCPport addresses. Dumic said that, while this
data can indicate visits to certain sites or

Haverford plans to offer co-ed apartments next year
By Mara Hvistendahl
Phoenix Staff
Joining a handful of other
schools that have responded to
student demands for more progressive housing options,
Haverford decided to offer co-ed
housing to upperclass students
beginning next year.
The change, which came out of
both desire among the general
community and more specific
concerns from the gay and lesbian community, will mean that

many of the apartments that
house a third of Haverford's students will now be open to mixed
groups of men and women.
Mixed gender arrangements will
only be allowed in two-bedroom,
three-person apartments.
Wesleyan University and
Hampshire College are among
the small number of colleges that
already allow similar housing
arrangements. It is unclear, however, whether Swarthmore,
which is intricately linked to
Haverford and traditionally at

the forefront of progressive administrative policies, will soon
follow suit.
"We've talked about coed housing before, and Housing Committee has been real clear in its recommendation that we should
not have co-ed housing," Dean of
Residential Life Myrt Westphal
commented.
Westphal said that part of the
reason the committee has rejected mixed gender housing is
because members are concerned
that straight couples would take

advantage of it to live together.
"They're opposed to having love
relationships living in the same
room, whether they're the same
gender or opposite genders, because it just creates too much of
a problem if and when they break
up," she said.
Committee members have also
expressed concern, however,
that a co-ed housing policy would
project an image that the college
is not necessarily ready to account for. "If we had co-ed housing, then some parents might not

allow their children to apply to
and to come to Swarthmore...
There was a sense that it might
hurt the diversity of Swarthmore
if we had this kind of policy."
She said, however, that she expects the issue will come up
again in the future and that the
committee will reconsider it at
that point. "If students want us
to look at this, then Housing Committee will put it on its agenda
next year and look at it and see

Environmental services employee HamzaWali, front, works on his computer skills with Susie Ansell, his student partner in the Learning for Life program.

Students, staff learn from each other
By Mara Hvistendahl
Phoenix Staff
"I'm at a point in my life right
now where I see the importance
of learning and of advanced education," Hamza Wali said. Wali,
59, has worked for Environmental Services for three years, but
for the past year he has spent
three work hours each week honing his computer skills.
Wali is a participant in Learning for Life, a program that pairs
staff members with students
with the aim of creating meaningful learning experiences for
both parties. He has been working with Susie Ansell 'O2, one of
the program's student coordinators, to learn word processing
and Internet skills.
The partnership has played to
his interest in business
Wali
would like to start his own and
has brought him an invaluable
tool for his future entrepreneurial ventures. "I just left the computer before I came here," he
said, laughing, in an interview.
"I'm very elated and pumped up
about the program. It's been a
catalyst or a motivator for me."
The idea for Learning for Life
originated from a student from
the Class of 1998 and was taken
up by Pat James, director of community service learning programs, and education professor
Diane Anderson. After Anderson
received grant money and Ansell
began to solicit students to get
involved, the program was
launched last fall as a service
component to Anderson's course
"Literacies and Social Identities." Students in that course had
extensive training and committed 40 hours to the program over
...

the course of the semester.
Since then, student involvement has been integral to the significant evolution of the program
from a classroom requirement to
voluntary commitment. The
number of students participating
in the program has grown to 30.
Staff interest has also increased,
and one of the challenges that
Ansell and the other two student
coordinators, Liz Derickson 'Ol
and Matt Oransky 'O2, now face
is finding student partners for all
interested staff.
According to many of its participants, the success of Learning for Life stems from its emphasis on generating community.
The relationships between students and staff that come out of
the program are meant to be
mutual learning experiences, and
both groups are instrumental in
making decisions about the future of the program.
When Derickson and Don
Bankston, an employee of Environmental Services, were paired
together last fall, neither knew
anything about HTML. Bankston
had made a part-time profession
out of computer repair and
wanted to learn more about the
Internet, so the two set to learning the Web design language.
After meeting with several computer science professors and
Computing Center employees,
they gradually reached the point
when Bankston was able to create an elaborate Web page independently funded by advertising.
In addition to alyns.com, his
personal Web page, Bankston has
since created several otherpages
for clients of his. He now also
works as a technical consultant
for Hand Technologies, an

Internet-based company.
Bankston's project has been a
source of pride for many Learning for Life participants, and it
even resulted in collaboration
between Bankston and another
learner, Sharon Pierce, who is
also an Environmental Services
employee. Pierce, who has been
focusing on photography in her
partnership with SuellenLee 'OO,
is now helping to provide photographs for Bankston's Web site.
Anderson said that this type of
exciting collaboration is exactly
what theprogram aims to accomplish. In most cases staff members have more defined, skillspecific objectives than simply
improving reading and writing
skills. Most partnerships revolve
around computer skills, and
Anderson said that one staff
member hopes to learn how to
play the piano next semester.
"We do have a fairly open understanding of what literacy is," she
explained.
Many staff find that degree of
flexibility the most rewarding
aspect of the program. "I'll never
stop learning as long as Learning
for Life is there, because the way
it's set up, you can see what your
needs are for knowledge and
[say], that's what I'd like to learn
next," Bankston said.
Staff hold a high degree of autonomy in the administration of
Learning for Life. Both staff and
students sit on the program's
steering committee, and Wali is
helping Anderson conduct research on the program.
Anderson and Derickson both
said that they hope that sense of
involvement will eventually be
effected in the broader college
community, where they see re-

source provisions as heavily oriented toward faculty and students. They have worked to secure e-mail addresses and computer access for staff members,
and, as the result of grant money
that Ansell applied for last fall,
13 staff members received used
computers for their homes as
part of the program.
Despite these advances, the
program coordinators also emphasized that problems remain
both with administering the program and with the broader aspiration of fully integrating staff
into the college community. In
the future, the steering committee hopes to make Learning for
Life accessible to all staff (because their schedules tend to be
more flexible, most current staff
participants are employees of
Environmental Services). Ansell
and Derickson would also like to
see accessible resources increased for staff not in the program. The two have applied for
a Lang Opportunity Grant, and,
if they receive it, they hope to
work toward increasing resource
access, with the ultimate goal of
installing renewable computers
in staff lounges.
"Staff don't feel comfortable in
certain spaces on campus,"
Ansell said. "We want to create
the sense that the staff is celebrated on campus."
For now, Learning for Life remains a positive source of community and inspiration for those
involved. Lee and Pierce exchanged Christmas gifts, and a
number of staff members have
invited students into their homes.
"It's become a support system
that I never envisioned," Ansell
said.

After strong student reaction
against the idea of a "major plus
one" restriction on course minors, the proposal presented to
the faculty by the Council on
Educational Policy last Friday
promoted instituting a cap on the
amount of overlap between curricular elements but not on the
number of them.
This most recent proposal of
the CEP is "for creation of minors, with a constraint on the extent of overlap that would be allowed between curricular elements, although not on the number of elements," said Provost
Jennie Keith, a member of the
CEP The precise details of these
constraints have not yet been released.
No decision was reached at the
meeting, and the faculty will continue to discuss the new proposal
at their next meeting on May 9.
There is no guarantee that the
motion will come to a formal vote
then or that the issue of course
minors will be resolved before
the end of this academic year.
The CEP originally proposed
the instatement of course minors
to amend perceived inequities
between the course and honors
programs. While the need for
course minors has been recognized, a method to properly
implement them has not yet been
decided upon. The new proposal
attempts to forge a compromise
between the interests of students
in pursuing a number of degree
elements and the concerns of faculty that students overextend
themselves. Some faculty feel
that the current policy allows
degree padding.
To address these faculty concerns, the "major plus one" restriction, which would have permitted a student to pursue only a
single degree element in addition
to a major, was suggested. Student reactions were strongly
against this proposal, spurring
the CEP to formulate a new compromise proposal.
According to Louisa WhitfieldSmith 'Ol, a member of the CEP,
"the compromise
presents a
very viable option for faculty,
administrators and students."
She believes that this new proposal will prove much more satisfying to students because it
remedies the current difficulties
faced by course majors without
excessively restricting their academic options.
"It's about equity of opportunity for course students,"
Whitfield-Smith said, "...giving
people who are doing de facto
minors now a sense of belonging
as an 'official' member of their
department communities."

A day with a Tiananmen dissident
By Min Lee
Phoenix Staff
Meeting Wang Dan for the
first time, one is struck by his,
well, for lack of a better expression, plainness. His short and
slender build, his somewhat
subdued demeanor, his lax
handshake and soft hands all
belie the real stature of the
former student leader.
After the initial pleasantries,
I was put at ease instantly by
his easygoing attitude, and the
more time I spent with Wang,
the more normal he seemed.
But he is, after all, no ordinary
figure. Wang, who spoke to the
Swarthmore community last
Friday, was one of the student
leaders of the 1989 student democracy movement in China.
The 'B9 student movement
began as a tribute to late liberal
reformer Hu Yaobang, the
former General Secretary of
the Chinese Communist Party,
who died in April of 1989. But
the initial protests gradually
snowballed into a large-scale
popular movement that eventually led to the takeover of
Beijing's largest public space,
Tiananmen Square.
On June 4, 1989, the Chinese
authorities cleared the square
by force, killing and injuring
hundreds of innocent students
and civilians in the process.
In theaftermath of the crackdown, Wang was captured after
spending a month in hiding. Following his arrest and an 18month detention, he was sentenced to a four-year term on
the count of spreading
"counter-revolutionary propaand engaging in
ganda
"counter-revolutionary incitement." He spent the next nine
years in and out of jail until being released two years ago on
medical parole and exiled to the
United States.
Strolling on the streets of
Philadelphia, however, Wang's
youthful looks did not stand out
one bit, as he appeared more the
tourist than the revolutionary.
Moments after setting foot on
the premises on the Liberty
Bell, he quickly gestured his
camera at me. After rushing
through the bell pavilion, we
carried on at the same pace
through Independence and Congress Halls, snapping photos
here and there.
At one point he brushed aside
my suggestion that we sit down
and listen to a tour. "This stuff,
we learned in high school," he
said dismissively. While I'm
sure he understood fully the historical import of these locations
Wang is now a graduate student in history at Harvard he
did not seem to take it to heart.
It was not Wang Dan, Chinese
freedom fighter, visiting the
symbols of freedom in
America. It was Wang Dan,
tourist, checking out Philly's
routine tourist spots.
Later, at a gift shop on South
Street, he swept up a couple of
postcards and a cup with "Philadelphia" emblazoned on it
rather indiscriminately.

Swatties snag big prizes
By Ibrahim Busnaina
For The Phoenix
Last week brought good news

to the many Swarthmore stu-

dents who applied this year for
Fulbright, Mellon and National
Science Foundation Fellowships.
Eighteen Swatties have received
awards so far, including four who
are awaiting final acceptance to
specific programs.
Out of 11 applicants, only one
Swarthmore student, Leigh
Nolan 'OO, has received final approval for a 2000 Fulbright Fellowship. The Fulbright provides
a stipend and travel expenses for
a year of foreign teaching or
study. Fellows must first be approved at the national level by
the Fulbright office in New York
and next by the local office of
their host country.
Four other Swarthmore applicants, Brent Wasser 'OO (Austria),
Darius Ornston 'OO (Finland),
Meredith Weems 'OO (Germany)
and Andrew King 'OO (Germany)
were accepted at the national
level but have yet to get the final
go ahead from their host country.
Associate Dean Gilmore Stott
noted that only half of all
Fulbright applicants nationally
are accepted through the U.S.
office, and only half of these studentsreceive final acceptance in
their host country. He expected

Wang Dan answers questions Friday as Min Lee translates.Wang spoke to
a packed Scheuer Room about the prospect of democracy in China.
Nor did he dwell on the irony
that the man largely responsible
for his captivity, Chinese President Jiang Zemin, had visited the
same grounds just prior to his
release.
Our conversation was even
more commonplace, jumping
from the latest movie releases (a
big Jet Li fan, he just saw "Romeo
Must Die") to his new life at
Harvard to the U.S. presidential
election (he was a Bradley supporter).
For a dissident in exile, he did
not seem particularly homesick,
perhaps because his parents are
free to visit him in the US. The
one poignant moment came when
I asked whether he had visited a
certain landmark in China. "I
thought I would get to visit
sooner or later," he said wistfully,
"even my classmates at Harvard
have been there."
His anonymity became even
more conspicuous when we visited Chinatown for lunch. Not one
single soul recognized him. "I look
too ordinary," he said. But the situation did not even change when
he came face-to-face with one of
his several memoirs out on the
market, which had his portrait on
the cover. The shopkeeper walked
right past him, even asking him
to move to the side.
On the trainride I learned that
Wang was a Swattie at heart. His
exhaustive reading list while in
prison included works such as
Sam Huntington's "Clash of Civilizations" and Michel Foucault's
"Power of Knowledge." He said
he found Harvard too conserva-

tive and uptight. "I like having
friends with pierced tongues,"
he said. He was most amused
when I informed him of our
"Dash for Cash" tradition.
But Wang put his private persona behind him when he
emerged to address a capacity
crowd in the Scheuer Room. He
answered questions from audience members with the precision of a polished politician and
the depth of a seasoned intellectual, injecting moments of levity along the way. He spoke of
the increasing role that nongovernmental organizations
should play, in lieu of governments, in pressuring regimes
that disrespect human rights.
His future role in the democracy movement, he said, was to
function as an independent intellectual in the growing independent intelligentsia emerging
in China, neither swayed by the
government or by the masses.
Wang also acknowledged the
new spaces created by popular
culture, giving as an example
the best-selling author Wang
Shuo, who "trivialized sacred
Communist ideologies" to the
point where people could not
take them seriously any more.
But the defining moment of
the event came in a gesture of
humility. In response to a question, he said, "history often coincidentally and mistakenly
creates these 'so-called' heroes,
and I am one of them," to a mixture of applause and laughter.
It was the Wang Dan I knew
at his best.

Swarthmore to meet the 25 percent acceptance rate.
In addition to the Fulbright
winners, Emily Manetta 'OO,
Linsey Wolter 'OO and Benjamin
Rutter '97 were selected by the
Andrew W. MellonFoundation as
recipients of 2000 MellonFellowships. According to Stott, these
are awarded to students who are
preparing for a career "of teaching and scholarship in humanistic studies."
Michael Anderson '99, Tamara
Brenner '9B, Alia Brukman 'OO,
Seth Budick '9B, Daniel Kraut 'OO,
Jacob Krich 'OO, Maria Krisch '99,
Susannah McCandless '99, Tara
Schubert '9B and Anne Tischler
'99 were all selected as winners
of the National Science Foundation Fellowship. Their NSF Fellowships will provide funds for
research pursuits in fields indicated on their applications. The
2000 group will receive funding
for graduate study in fields including economics, genetics, evolution, biochemistry, physics, geography and microbiology.
Overall, Stott considered this
year uncannily successful. He
noted that the number of candidates has been higher than in recent years, as has their level of
success. "Swarthmore is known
as a place for wonderful students," he said. "It has been one
of the best years overall."

Co-ed dorms on the rise
From CO-ED, pg. 3
how it meshes with what our
goals are and what our values
are," Westphal said.
According to Tim Stewart-Winter 'Ol, coordinator of the Queer
Peer Counselor program, the issue of co-ed housing may come
up very soon. "If the administration is willing to engage this issue, I would like to work to
change this policy -1 would much
rather that Swat be ahead of the
curve on this particular social
change than behind the curve."
Westphal said she welcomes
student comments, especially
from members of the queer community. But for many students,
the issue does not arouse strong
opinion on either side they are
in favor of co-ed housing, but
theymight not take advantage of
it if it were offered.
"I think as long as it's reserved
for upperclassmen, then people by
that point know what kind of privacy they need and who they can
share their space with comfort-

ably," said Jack Borrebach 'O2.
This seems to reflect the re
ception the new policy has re
ceived at Haverford. Most stu
dents support it, but administra
tors anticipate that only five ol
the 134 apartments allowed to be
co-ed will be rented by mixed
gender groups next fall.
Some students would argue
however, that it is just a matter ol
having the option available to those
who want it, however few they
number. Stewart-Winter woulc
like to see the college work towarc
the progressiveness and flexibil
ity of a mixed-gender policy.
"I've always thought that even
tually it will be commonplace fOl
this to be allowed," he said
"When my parents went to col
lege, there were lots of restric
tions on mixed-gender interac
tions, visiting hours, curfews, el
cetera. I think that by the time
my kids are in college, they'L
find the ban on mixed-gendei
friends living together just as
silly as those restrictions now
seem to me."

dogs to boil, that's a restaurant."
In order to gain more control
over the owner of a liquor license, some members of the
council are hoping a hotel could
be built on college property. They
said that since the college has an
institutional interest in preventing a restaurant from becoming
a tavern or bar, it could, through
the terms of a lease of its property, prevent the owner of a liquor license from creating a tavern or a bar.
"We're justtrying to accommodate it if the college wants it,"
said council member Don
Delson. "We're not imposing it."
Of course, even if the college
actually wants to lease some of
its land for a hotel, where it would
be located and whether it would
be profitable are among the
many unanswered questions
about the idea.
"The college hasn't made that
decision yet and they have the
right to take their time," said
Willetts.
Leaving that decision for later,
borough council has asked the
state for an amendment to the liquor code that would allow the
town to limit the sale of alcohol
to college property.
"Nothing in the existing law is
narrow enough," Seidman said.
Currently, the state only allows
a limited set ofreferendum questions on the sale of alcohol; without the change in state law,
Swarthmore could choose to allow the sale of alcohol at hotels
but could not limit alcohol sales

urn m er

Council members in favor of a
referendum said they were confident the change would pass at
the state level.
"I think it's likely because
we've had excellent help from
our legislators in the [state]
House and Senate," said Delson.
If the state does change the liquor code, though, the restricted
wording would still have to pass
in a referendum of Swarthmore
residents, and guessing the outcome of that vote is much harder.
Willetts said she was not sure
how borough residents felt about
the issue and was in favor of a
which pollster and posurvey
litical science professor Keith
Reeves said he would be able to
do.
If the referendum did pass,
Delson said the decision would
then lie with the college. And if
the college decided against the
idea, he said he thought the council should just keep the borough
completely dry.
Delson said support on the
council for the change in the liquor code and for a hotel on college property did not mean the
council was imposing anything
on the college.
"It is an imposition if the borough is imposing it," he said, "but
there is no obligation on the part
of the college."
And Willetts said she knew of
many Swarthmore residents who
would prefer the town to stay
completely dry.
"I think a lot of people are perfectly happy the way we are," she
said.

From INTERNET, pg. 3
the transfer of certain types of
files, it cannot determine the content or legality of usage.
"The view we have is a very
high-level one," he added, "and
we have to go through a lot of
effort to find out who an individual is, and even then we have
to ask them about the content."
Tom Stephenson, chair of the
Computing Services Committee,
agreed, saying that heavy network use did not necessarily connote copyright infringement, or
vice-versa. The college would not
hunt for MP3 or software pirates,
he said, but he added, "If the college uncovers infringements, it
needs to take steps to stop it.... It
might be that we'd have to make
sure you stopped, not just ask
[that you stop]."
The announcement comes only
a week after the band Metallica
named Napster and threeuniversities as defendants in a $lO million lawsuit. Stephenson said the
suit "didn't figure into the announcement, but I think we're
going to have a more concerted
approach to educating people as
to their responsibilities under
copyright law."
Some students argued that the
college should purchase enough
bandwidth to accommodate highbandwidth applications. "Swarthmore has the resources to give
us the kind of Internet access we
want, which means free, fast and
unregulated," said Russell
Shiguera 'O2. "It's not like we
don't pay for it."

Within several years, all interested students may be able to
receive a stipend for summer internships at approved community service organizations in the
Greater Philadelphia area or possibly in their hometowns, Director of Community Service Learning Programs Pat James announced two weeks ago. The program will be launched with the
Summer of Service 2000, a more
limited pilot initiative that will
provide financial support for approximately 25 students to participate in public service internships in or near Philadelphia this
summer.
The program will be administered by the Summer of Service
Committee, whichis overseen by
The Swarthmore Foundation.
Members of the committee are
drawn from the Community Service Learning Office, the
Swarthmore Foundation and the
college administration.
The primary purpose of the
Summer of Service is two-fold,
according to James. First, the
program is intended to encourage all students to devote at least
one summer to public service
and to explore this field as a possible career choice. Second, the
program makes extensive community service work possible for
students who would otherwise
need to spend their summers
earning money for college.
The Summer of Service should
also lessen the burden on the
Swarthmore Foundation, an organization that awards grants to
students working on a variety of
service projects, while at the
same time supporting the efforts
of established community organizations.
Many of the students who formerly would have applied to the
Swarthmore Foundation for
funds to cover summer community service work will now be
able to receive funding through
the Summer of Service program,
in which students apply directly
for an internship at an approved
organization. Indeed, several students who originally applied for
funding through the Swarthmore
Foundation will instead undertake Summer of Service internships in their hometowns this
summer.
In the future, the Swarthmore
Foundation will continue to fund
student-directed
projects,
whereas the Summer of Service
program will support internships
created and supervised by service organizations.
The idea for the Summer of
Service program emergednearly
two years ago during discussions
within the Student Life and the
Academic Programs Planning
Subgroups of the Committee on
Long Range Planning, according
to Vice President Maurice
Eldridge.
Although opportunities for
subsidized internships were
available in the natural and social sciences, the college did not

,

offer as many similar programs
in the humanities and particularly in the area of community
service, Eldridge said.
He added that the internships
will serve as a direct extension
of the education students receive
in the classroom.
"I think that the summer internships give students the real
world experience that allows students to apply theoretical knowledge gained in college and perhaps shape that knowledge
in
another setting," he said.
Funding for the Summer of
Service program will come from
the current $230 million capital
campaign in the form of a $2 million endowment, according to
Eldridge.
James noted that it was "pretty
unusual" for a capital campaign
to support a creative project such
as the Summer of Service. "It
puts Swarthmore in a leadership
position in terms of service learning," she said. "I don't know of
any other schools that offer students support to do service at
quite that level."
But money from the capital
campaign will not be available in
time to cover the costs of this
summer's internships, and the
college has not yet secured an
alternative source of funding.
The college is currently exploring several potential sources of
funding, according to Eldridge,
who said he was "not un-optimistic" about the possibilities for
obtaining the necessary capital.
Students interested in this
year's program may apply for an
internship at one ofabout a dozen
service organizations approved
by the Committee. This
summer's list includes organizations ranging from Congreso de
Latinos Unidos Latina Domestic
Violence Program, a non-profit
agency that advocates for victims of domestic violence from
the Latino community of North
Philadelphia, to the Swarthmore
Fire and Protective Association,
a volunteer organization that responds to local fire and emergency medical calls.
Most of the approved organizations are "reasonably wellknown" by the college and have
had Swarthmore students work
with them in the past, according
to James.
"We have a fairly good sense
that they will offer good internships," James said.
In addition to a basic living allowance that covers housing,
food and transportation costs, all
interns will receive a stipend of
$lB5O, the amount that students
on financial aid are expected to
earn each summer. This stipend
may vary according to future
fluctuations in summer earning
requirements for students on financial aid, but the program is
open both to students who do and
those who do not receive financial aid from the college.
James predicts that the program will realize its goal of accommodating all students who
want internships within four or
five years.

The Internet police
The none-too-metaphorical lines of communication
between Swarthmore and the outside world are caving
in under the pressure of frantic bandwidth usage.
Faced with the sudden realization of limited supply on
their Internet line, the laissez-faire Computing Center
made the unconventionally disruptive decision this
week to put a cap on individual byte transfer.
We support the CC for making practical claims to
bandwidth control. In the scheme of things, policing
quantity of usage is a nice-guy tactic when compared
to the oft-inflicted software and content bans at other
colleges. The CC no doubt made a well-informed choice
and they will make their policy work.
That said, we don't think policing is the long-term
answer and we don't think the attitude of increased
control is good for anyone. Here's why:
Rules are meant to be broken. The type of person the
CC wants to control is the type of person who has the
know-how to get around the system. We're not saying
there will be a slew of rerouted bytes, but if a few
people are hell-bent on kicking ass at Counterstrike,
there could be a few.
Since when does "college business" and faculty
research have priority over student academic usage?
Even if the bulk of student traffic is recreational, the
CC's new policy language essentially equates important, official-type usage with important, official-type
people. It's dangerously close to us versus them.
If the CC is currently renegotiating their contract
with our service provider, they have to be nearsighted
not to want more bandwidth. Unless they know something we don't, Internet usage is unlikely to plateau.
The types of data that everyone (not just students)
transfers are increasingly not 2-bit text commands but
rather multi-millionbit streaming media. What
happens when official-type people start using the
Internet for video teleconferencing?
The college currently pays $33,000 a year for
Internet access
surely less than the salary of one CC
staff member, and there are about two dozen of them.
The money needed for more bandwicth is measly
compared to what we spend on CC salaries alone. The
Internet is the worldwide focus of popular technology;
it should hold a dearer place in the college's heart.

A dry run
Somewhere in the elite stacks of paperwork that pile
up on the desks of campus higher-ups, there is a
proposal that could very well change the alcohol policy.
The Deans are expecting students this fall to come up
with changes to the party receipt system, changes that
will still allow students to drink safely but also cover
the college's butt. Students will have a crucial decision
to make, because if they don't act, the Deans may.
It is along these lines that we are reminded of this
year's Spec Weekend. Spec Weekend was officially dry,
because having a "wet" one has been extremely
problematic in the past.
While the dry weekend was probably a good idea
based on precious harassment, the social scene was far
from perfect. It may have just been coincidence that
an alcohol poisoning and multiple incidents of vandalism occurred during a dry spell, but we doubt it.
Students decided to drink privately
a circumstance
which has been shown to increase the frequency of
alcohol poisonings. Private parties drew noise complaints and vandalism erupted in these same spaces.
We can't ignore what happened. But if students are
to enact change on their own, it will be necessary to
understand where the administration is coming from.
The liability of a student dying because of alcohol that
the college paid for has unbelievable consequences in
the minds of Deans and faculty. The proper solution
which is probably beyond anyone's grasp right now
will require both fessing up to our own illegality in a
more than superficial way and remembering the
inescapable harm of a noose on public drinking.

D.C. protesters have real concerns
To the Editor:
We are appalled thatRohan Hoole must endorse statesponsored violence and police brutality because he disagrees with the goals of the thousands who converged
on Washington, D.C. last week to protest International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank policies ("DC
protestors don't know the facts," Opinions, pg. 9, April
20). But focusing on tear gas and illegal arrests obscures
the real importance of these protests.
Hoole writes that "it is ironic that precisely when
these institutions [the IMF and World Bank] have become more progressive, the protestors in D.C. are
calling for them to be abolished." None of the
Swarthmore protesters ever advocated thatthe World
Bank or IMF be abolished. Hoole has misrepresented
the intent of the protests, which was not to "shut down"
the IMF or the World Bank permanently, but rather
obstruct these meetings in order to draw attention to
the need for radical reform.
Hoole says the "majority of the people in my unit
[at the World Bank] were actually from developing
countries," seemingly divorcing them from first world
agendas and alliances. The simple fact that the World
Bank and IMF delegations include third world participants does not guarantee these delegates' allegiance with their own poor and working class people.
The government officials from these countries are
usually among the most conservative, northern-educated and wealthy members of the government. But
even they aren't necessarily given the power to advocate on behalf of their country's majority: they are
often coerced by loan threats into going along with
IMF/World Bank demands.
Hoole claims that there is "irony" in the relationship
between the protests and the World Bank's recently
"becom[ing] more progressive." The opposite is true:
there is a direct correlationbetween the power of those
inside these institutions who do want reform and the
growing popular resistance to IMF and World Bank
policy. This resistance movement fundamentally addresses the system of global economic injustice, of which
the IMF and World Bank are but two components. It is
led by more than 1200 citizens organizations ranging
from African women's groups and Latin American peasant associations to the AFL-CIO and international labor,
to NGOs from 65 countries. With the cooperation of

World Bank director Jim Wolfensohn, these groups have
been able to push their concerns, at least in rhetoric, onto
the World Bank's agenda.
We are not conspiracy theorists, as Hoole would portray us. We are concerned by real increases in poverty,
real destruction of ecosystems and real losses of" human
and economic rights.
Hoole's characterization of the group as a bunch of
"white liberals" makes invisible the students of color who
participated in the protests as well as their reasons for
doing so, and means to relegate all white students to one
patronizing and unthinking group. Our entire group engaged in public discussion in which we wrestled with the
complex issues of sustainable, democratic economic development. We are disappointed that Hoole did not attend.

Down South: the neglected stereotype
By Elizabeth Goldsmith
For The Phoenix
So I was 18 and a would-be frosh at another school's equivalent of Spec Weekend. I was hovering by the food table, wondering how I should go about mingling
with what I just knew were some of the
smartest people in the whole wide world.
Another spec came up to me to break the
ice. After we exchanged names, he asked
the next standard question: "Where are
you from?"
"Kentucky," I replied.
"Oh, really?" A knowing look came over
his face, and I winced to myself, sure he
was going to ask me about Wendell Berry
or some other Kentucky-related issue
about which I'd have to demonstrate my
ignorance.
"Well, then, this must be a real culture
shock for you, right?"
What?
"I'm sorry, what did you say?"
"Well, I mean, you know, Kentucky, it's
not exactly the intellectual center of the
nation, is it?"
Excuse me?! "I'm not sure what you
mean by that."
"What?—Nothing, I just was wondering
if this was, I don't know, a new experience
for you."
Yeah, asshole, they took the hayseed out
of my teeth and they're making me wear
shoes.
I didn't say it. I should have said something, though, just as I should say something every time somebody tosses off a
slur about rednecks, or "Southern" accents, or "trailer trash." Sure, he meant it
as a joke. And it wasn't funny, because no
matter what his tone or intention, what he
said was very serious.
I have heard many Swatties make similar comments. It is ironic that in a place
which seems to set such a high premium
on diversity and tolerance, it is oftenthose
who claim the closest connection with
those virtues who are the most emphatic
participants in this kind of stereotyping

a kind which is at its core about as hierarchical, objectifying and classist as ste-

reotypes can get.
Everyone knows what I'm talking about;
it's part of pop culture. Want to demonstrate how ignorant an idea is? Say it with
a "hick" accent. What's Kentucky like?
Full of people sleeping with their siblings
and living in trailers. These ideas are reflected everywhere, from magazines to
movies, from the "Could ya please payiss the jay-elly?" guy on the fruit preserves commercial to the rowdy drunken
men on TV dramas who drive pickup
trucks withrebel flags on the back.
Well, people speak the way they do because of where they were born, and people
live where they can afford to live. Speaking with an accent does not make you stupid, living below the Mason-Dixon line
does not make you an asshole, and living
in a place that didn't cost a million dollars
does not make you worthless. What this
stereotyping amounts to is a judgment of
someone based on where they come from,
where they stay, how they talk and, for all
practical purposes, how muchmoney they
have a judgment whichis wrong in both
senses of the word: inaccurate and unjust.
And that sounds like a pretty good definition of prejudice.
I'm being hypersensitive, some people
would say. Well, if that is what I'm called
for being angry at prejudice which has
hurt people I love, then I'm glad to be.
Yes, this does hurt people. I had a friend
come to visit me at Swatand end up afraid
to speak because he was made fun of—or patronized: "Oh, that's so cute! Say 'ice

cream' again!" I'd spend the weekend being quiet with my normally loud and
cheerful friend, embarrassed that I had
brought him somewhere where people
thought it was acceptable to be thatrude.
I have a friend who wants to go to graduate school in New York City, and so has
spent the last two years trying to teach
himself not to pronounce his words the
way he was raised to, because he knows
that otherwise he won't be taken as seriously. What drove that point home for him
was a visit to me at Swarthmore freshman year, when he found himself silent
witness to a conversation wherein an accent just a little too similar to his own was
used, without being disputed or even
noted by anyone present, to convey ignorance.
I don't think most people who subscribe
to these notions mean to be cruel or biased. I think most of them don't even realize what they are doing, or that what they
are doing has the power to affect people's
lives adversely
and the idea that it
wouldn't even occur to them is almost
more upsetting than a conscious choice. I
know I don't speak for everyone who has
ever felt connected to similar comments
about states, accents or lifestyles. What I
can say, though, is that I think that those
who want to consider themselves aware
ofissues of diversity need to keep an open
mind about what that means. An effort to
see past stereotypes should not discriminate between them. I think most of us here
would accept that in theory; it's unfortunate that we don't always seem capable
of putting it into practice.

tETTERSTOTHE EDITOR

Don't overreact to SBC budget cuts
To the Editor:
I am writing in response to your editorial and article on the
SBC budget cut ("Butchering Swat," Staff Editorial, pg. 7; "Student groups face 19 percent funding cut," News, pg. 3, April 20).
The majority of this campus seems to understand the budget
cut and, while unhappy, realizes that Budget Committee had no
other realistic choice. I think it's wonderful that so many campus organizations are reaching unprecedented levels of activity, but the need for money does not create money.
Realizing that $350,000 is more than $284,000 (the amount SBC
can afford to allocate to student groups) does not make normal
students "economists without a shred of heart or soul." Instead,
it shows that this campus has finally realized, after about three
years of high spending, that Swatties cannot continue to do all
of these activities on the SAF funds alone.
The Phoenix surmises that many would be willing to pay an
even higher SAF fee to cover the increase in spending as well as
the capital replacement. Not all students would agree. Having
everything free on campus is a great Swarthmore tradition, but
it does mean that Swatties at large subsidize activities that hundreds may participate in and activities that only two people participate in. We all make choices about what we do with our time.
Playing hockey with the Mother Puckers, going to a SAC-funded
party, bringing in a speaker, or playing Ultimate are all luxuries, not an inherent right. With limited funding available, not
every group can always do everything it wants, or even "needs,"
to do.
Budget Committee will need to relearn how to say no to prevent such crises from happening again. In light of this current
budget cut, I hope that student groups on campus will recognize
the precious nature of their funding and will work to use that
money more efficiently. I also hope that The Phoenix will choose
to make the best of theirbudget cut instead of dealing with it "in
the most disgruntled possible way."
Annaliesse Hyser 'O2

To the Editor:
Last Monday afternoon I was sitting in my room contemplating how I could best hurt next year's Swarthmore community, since I will not be here to do it myself. Then I remembered that I was meeting with my fellow SBC members that
evening to discuss the currently proposed financial situation
for next year, and I got so excited that I had to run around
campus five times.
If you believe that SBC's action of cutting budgets was at all
due to our own evil intentions or recent miscalculations, you
are simply wrong. If you talk to any treasurer who had to go
through the ordeal of spring budgeting in recent weeks, I am
sure s/he will tell you that we were not exactly throwing money
at her/his group. We are a group of students, just like you, who
get together on a weekly basis for the purpose of making sure
that, financially, student groups are running smoothly. No, we
are not perfect. No, we are not the same people from year to
year or even semester to semester.
Perhaps past budget committees are to blame for the situation in which we now find ourselves, but that does not make it
productive to sit around and complain about it. We need to be
responsible and we need to set a precedent of financial responsibility. Individuals who complain about the lack of funding
for their particular organizations are left with several options:
1) find a way for club sports and the Halcyon to go back to the
funding they came from, 2) go crying to the administration for
more money, 3) "...make do in the most disgruntled possible
way" (Phoenix Editor in Chief Justin Kane 'O2, as quoted in
The Phoenix) or 4) recognize the fact that if we live beyond
our means we are pushing the responsibility elsewhere. The
question comes down to this, are we children who go crying to
mommy and daddy every time things go wrong, or are we adults
who play the hand we are dealt? The choice is yours, I am out
of here.

What I have
learned
At some point during the semester, my

room, though usually the ne plus ultra of
cleanliness and order, became, at least to
me, a minor disaster. I currently tally the

clothing I have left at two pairs of socks
and something that, while nominally classified as underwear, would serve this purpose at best incompletely. It would seem
that finally the legion rigors of the end of
the semester have bested me, and I, with
silent acquiescence, am obliged to sift
through a pile of papers, so numerous as
to nearly equal a chapter of Hugo's, just
to find the keyboard.
It is hard to press on in our academic
journey in these heady days of spring. As
I once wondered how I awoke, if only
enough to drive a car, to go to school every morning at 6:30, now do I wonder how
those poor unfortunate souls, still confined to the invisible-iron gates of secondary education, manage to hang on
until well nigh the middle of June
oftentimes.
Nevertheless, the learning must continue, and so, as the final Phoenix of this
academic year preaches on, these are a
few of the things I have learned, in and
out of class in, with what I hope is no offense to Sinatra, the April of my years.
1) I have obsessive-compulsive disorder. Having spoken of this with other
devotees of the malady, I am now certain of its nefarious influence in my life.
Yet, I think it has gotten better. When I
was in high school, once I checked to see
if my contacts were in their cases once
a minute for nearly forty-five minutes
before convincing myself of their safety
and my necessity for sleep. Now, I
merely relegate myself to putting the
television on the same channel every
night before turning it off and the specific positioning of my wristwatch when
not in use. I haven't gotten up in the
middle of the night to re-brush my teeth
in months.
2) I am funny by accident. Though my
circle of friends, acquaintances, wellwishers and evil-doers is rather restricted,
I do receive a great deal of commentary
on a bi-weekly basis regarding the neardelusional writings herein. And what I
have come to conclude is that I do not
know what is funny. Sometimes, the conversations go like this:
Person: "That was really funny."
Me: "When I said we should all be
shipped off to Siberia to work in coal factories and forced to eat live rats as recompense for our crimes against the
masses?"
Person: "Yeah, except for the 'recompense' part. I think we should be paid in
dollars."
And other times:
Person: "Your column stinks."
Me: "The one in which I likened Willets
to the fifth level of hell?"
Person: "Yeah, what would simoniacsbe
doing in Willets?"
3) Five-hundred words isn't enough.
Agitate for longer columns. I can't guarantee humor, but I can guarantee more
words.

Losing our
footing
On a stone tablet in the northeast corner
ofClothier is inscribed a message delivered
there by the President of the United States
on Oct. 25,1913 while giving the Founders'
Day address: "Do not forget as you walk
these classic places ... you are here to enrich the world and you impoverish yourself
if you forget the errand."
It justmight be timefor another Dr. Wilson to deliver another speech such as this
at Swarthmore College, a Swarthmore College which I feel has lost its grounding in
a world of apathy, worldliness and dogmatic defence of the status quo. Maybe
this is not the case, though. It is possible
that all we need as the quintessential "ethically intelligent" community is a reorientation toward what really is important and
worthwhile in our universe.
I feel that there is a need to reorient ourselves somewhere, somehow, because I
believe the trajectory we find ourselves
on is one shaped too much by our surroundings: the consumerism, the apathy
and the logic of accumulation that seem
like watchwords for who we are. I'd like
to think, as I have written before, that we
are as beings infinitely more complex,
powerful and valuable than summaries of
our consumer profiles and our investment
portfolios. A need for a change is clear.
The most serious concern among my
own community, the Left, seems to be a
lack of positive vision, and I believe that
is indicative of a lot of what I see around
here in other groups. We know what we
don't like about the current system, but
we don't know where we should go to
change what we don't like. How can we
go up to the World Bank and tell them to
humanize without giving them an alternative model on which to operate?
I don'tpretend I know the answer to what
a new trajectory should be, what a new
project for theLeft or for our society should
look like. I can, though, write down a couple
of thoughts I have about the problem.
The first is that we as individuals tend to
allow ourselves to be pigeon-holed into the
famous category "rational, self-interested,
atomized." And this can lead directly to us
not thinking of community or friendship at
all; we refuse to acknowledge our connection to those around us. What community
looks like in economics is interdependent
utility curves and defining social welfare
functions. What it can look like in life is a
real coming together to define a project that,
while tremendously difficult, is also not just
a weighted aggregation of interests.
The second is the need to reaffirm the
language of democratic citizenship, of a
stronger democracy. The lack of this language encourages individuals to hate the
whole idea of "protesting," the real process of democracy. This negative cult of
technocracy ends any really strong feelings about anything, because the assumption is that you don't know what you are
talking about. Not only is this blatantly
wrong, it is dangerously undemocratic.
These are just a couple of things that I
feel important, but if you disagree or have
others, come talk to me about it. It could be
the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Housing opinion unethical Kushner's
identity

To the Editor:
I would like to respond to Ted Chan's
article about the housing lottery and the
alleged conduct of an RA at the junior lottery ("Ethics problems sour housing lottery," Opinions, pg. 8, April 20).
Mr. Chan's treatment of this topic, in my
opinion, was highly unethical. There were
at least 18people that were spoken of in his
article, but only one name was given. That
is poor, unethical form. The article was
poorly researched and I feel that he abused
his position at The Phoenix to air his beef.
There are more misrepresented facts.
The Wharton triple went to special needs
and its status was updated on the board
outside Dean Westphal's office. The board
is updated every day before the lotteries
begin. Housing packets are distributed
two and a half weeks before blocks are
due and four weeks before the senior lottery. In those four weeks, changes are
made to fit the needsof students with special needs. Those special needs are none
of our business. The Housing Committee
and Deans do not feel it necessary to reprint over one thousand packets for the
benefit of students interested in a Wharton
triple or any other changes made.
Let's move on to the Worth triple that
Mr. Chan was not lucky enough to receive,

and his notion that it was as the result of
Ms. Yoon's actions. It is true thatMs. Yoon
announced this triple was still available.
It is blatantly false that she manipulated
and "organized" three juniors into picking this triple. Who are we to judge the
sincerity of the juniors wanting this
space? Moreover, before Ms. Yoon announced the availability of this triple, she
asked Dean Westphal for permission. In
fact, Ms. Yoon was well within her jurisdiction as an RA.
As to Mr. Chan's grave concerns over
"unethical practices in obtaining housing,"
Dean Westphal is a professional who has
been doing this for many years, and she is
more than qualified to recognize special
needs and how to best serve students with
such needs. Once again, no names were
given, which leads me to believe that exaggerated rumors and gossip were made
to fit the purposes of a specific agenda.
In defense of Mr. Chan, he did apologize
to Ms. Yoon and Dean Westphal for misrepresentations in his article. In the future,
I hope The Phoenix will refrain from being
the community gossip forum and continue
on its path to better, well-informedand wellresearched journalism.

Vandalism in
Parrish

Mascot plan
already tried

Alcohol should
not be a staple

To the Editor:
We write to alert the community and to
express our distress over an act of vandalism that occurred sometime during the
night of April 8. The portrait of John W.
Nason that hangs in the hallway of the first
floor of Parrish was defaced with a red
marker.
While acts of vandalism are sadly not
rare occurrences at Swarthmore, we felt
compelled to bring this particular act to
the attention of the community. John
Nason played a valued and significant role
in Swarthmore's history, having served
the college for 21 years, including 13 as
president of the college (1940-1953). He
continues to be an honored member of our
community, and still visits the campus on
occasion.
Damage to works of art and to documents of the college's history can be irremediable; we cannot replace what we lose.
Happily, in this case faculty in the Art
Department have determined that the
portrait can be restored, but this will be
at considerable cost to the college.
We write to you in part to ask that anyone with information about this vandalism
come forward, but mainly so people will
understand thatthese thoughtless destructive acts can have far deeper repercussions
to our community than one might realize.

To the Editor:
Ted Chan's April 13 column ("Sultans of
Swat?", Sports, pg. 22) eloquently scorned
the vagueness of "the Garnet Tide" and
deplored the absence of a college mascot.
"If the administration won't facilitate the
selection," he wrote, "I may go insane and
run the contest myself...."
Go insane you would, Ted. "The administration," or a tiny part of it, already tried
this in 1995-96: I proposed a mascot contest that fall. We solicited ideas from the
students, faculty, staff and Alumni Council. A committee chose six finalists from
more than 100 suggestions: the Swarming
Earthworms, the Garnet Foxes, the Griffins, the Wild Kangaroos, the Mighty Oaks
and the Little Quakers. (Footnotes on request.)
Not everyone cheered us on. "If you
choose an animal, the animal rights folks
will be up in arms," warned an alumnus.
More typical were haughty declarations
that any mascot at all would lump precious
Swarthmore with pathetic also-rans
among the beer-soaked, sports-crazy
hordes that never show up in U.S. News &
World Report. So among the voting options
was "No Mascot."
I don't have to tell you who won. And 77
percent of the students were on the "winning" side.

To the Editor:
I am writing in response to your article
"Crime, alcohol poisoning mar dry Spec
Weekend" (News, p. 3, April 10). "With a
relatively tight noose on excessive drinking," reads the article, "students' main concern is there was too little fun to be had
last weekend."
The implication here is that students'
primary source of entertainment on campus is alcohol. With that removed, students
are unable to enjoy themselves with safe
and sober diversions. Were this the case,
it would be a sad day, indeed. However,
the problem may be with non-representative claims made by the article, and not
with the actual sentiments of Swarthmore
students, many of whom take advantage
of the film, music, and conversation opportunities that Swarthmore offers.
Instead of blaming the single dry weekend, perhaps we should locate part of the
problem in Swarthmore's regular social
life. If students aren't able to find non-alcoholic entertainment during Spec Weekend, than this probably signals a ongoing
deficiency that students and administrators alike should be interested in correcting.

To the Editor:
I was upset and disappointed by Scott
Kushner's comments in last week's Phoenix ("Baseball's purest things," Sports, April
20, Back Page). Specifically, I take issue with
his reference a poem by Jenny Yang entitled
"I am AsianAmerican Woman." In this column, Kushner states, "I am Division 111 collegia! baseball player because I like to write
about patriarchal assault in cheezy inspirational pieces of self-identity... Well that was
fun, moving right a10ng..."
No matter who you are, publishing a
poem as genuine and personal as Jenny's
takes guts, especially in The Phoenix.
Sure, to call it a "cheezy piece of self-identity" is perfectly legal and a matter of
opinion, but if we want to hear about something besides Sharpies food and the lack
of parking spaces, we need to support
people when they take risks and give us a
piece of their heart. Invalidating people's
self-identity for "fun" doesn't seem like a
particularly valuable use of newsprint or
a way to change the conditions that makes
those pieces of self-identity necessary in
the first place.

Mumia retrial
To the Editor:
We at Just Cause are sure many on campus know something about the case of
Mumia Abu-Jamal. Sentenced to death in
1982 for the murder of a Philadelphia police officer, Jamal's case has gained global attention.
Mumia Abu-Jamal must not die: he deserves a new trial. In the next weeks, Jamal
will have his day in federal court. We hope
you will join us that day in Philadelphia,
along with thousands more who will take a
stand against the racism, classism and inequity that plague our court system.

Four year journey: a senior looks back
By David King
For The Phoenix
I've known for quite some time now that
I wanted to write some kind of retrospective article on my time here at Swarthmore.
The question is: where to start?
I guess I'll try the beginning. I chose
Swarthmore four years ago because, well,
it just fit. It was a liberal arts college with
an engineering program, the campus was
beautiful, the food was supposedly great
(for a college), the people were friendly
and the campus met my criterion of being a train ride away from New York
(okay, two train rides).
Today, though, I feel sad to say that this
school has let me down.
I've been deliberating whether or not
to write all this, because I've only said it
privately to a couple of people. But... here
I go.
What bothers me about this place is that
people here tend to think more with their
heads than their hearts.
You volunteer with SHIP or tutor in
Chester? I'll show you a handful of people
who lock themselves up in Cornell, emerging only to trek down to Sharpies. You're
an RA and a SAM and a WA? Well, how
often do you stop to chat with your
hallmates? How are you as a friend, in
being supportive to people who look to you
for guidance or for an ear?
In shooting to get into graduate school
or to be recruited by a consulting firm, do
you appreciate your time here, on this 300acre arboretum?
In my Ways of Seeing class two years
ago, Abbe Blum taught us something that
has stuck with me: while inhaling, say "I

Today, though, I feel sad to say that this school has let me down.
What bothers me about this place is that people here tend to think
more with their heads than their hearts.
am here," and while exhaling, say "now."
I encourage you to try it.
It's kind of funny to be a senior now. Not
funny funny, but scary funny. (Seniors
know what I mean.)
When I arrived at Swarthmore in August 1996,1 saw the juniors on my hall as
far above me. Now, I find myself having
that dreaded "second semester senior"
conversation an average of 13.5 times a

day.
Other person: "So, do you know what
you're doing after graduation yet? Or is
that a bad question to ask?"
Me: "No, no, that's okay. I'd like to write
for a newspaper or magazine."
"Oh."
"Yeah. I think I might just go back home
to New York and look for something there
for the time being. But I definitely want
to go to graduate school some day."
"Oh."
"How about you?"
"Well, after doing an honors doublemajor in psychobiology and sociology/anthropology with a minor in engineering
and a concentration in Asian studies, I'm
going to the Kennedy School at Harvard.
On the side, I'll have an internship with
Goldman Sachs on Wall Street."
"Oh."
"Yeah. Do you know how much an apartment in Manhattan costs?"
Okay, I'm kind of exaggerating. But in
all honesty, as I think about finding a job,

the reality of leaving Swarthmore hits me.
The real world isn't sheltered. The real
worldis concerned about profits. The real
world uses sex to sell. And the real world
won't challenge you intellectually.
So, this is kind of scary for me right now.
I've contributed to The Phoenix since I
was a freshman, when Katey Menzer
wrote a boldand witty column and Vincent
Jones wanted to tell us "another thing."
Writing articles has, without a doubt, been
my greatest joy here. And here I am on
my last one.
I guess I'll end on two notes. First, please
do not put down Sharpies. This is a soft spot
for me. Linda McDougall and company are
always open to requests and suggestions.
Try e-mailing them, rather thanbad-mouthing them just to make conversation.
Second, academics aside, this school can
be a great place. You can be SWIL, SQU
and ETS. You can be DU, football team and
SCF if you want. You can play drinking
games on a Thursday night or you can, like
me, choose not to drink, and people will
generally respect that.
Wherever you're from, and for whatever reason you chose Swarthmore, don't
forget just how much you've got here
outside the classroom or computer lab. If
you do live between Cornelland Sharpies,
at least stop and smell the flowers as you
walk from one to the other.
As for me, I don'tknow where I'll be in
32 days, but lam here ... now.

Don't ban guns in church Uninformed
at Sharples
tabling

To the Editor:
In his column last week ("Praying for a
good campaign," Opinions, pg. 9), Dan
Korobkin asks, "Come on who wouldn't
support a ban on guns in churches?" Well,
you can add me to the list, along with the
legislatures and governors of the 22 states
Korobkin mentions (including Pennsylvania) and just about anyone else who bothers to work through the theory and empirical research on concealed carry of handguns. Korobkin's wholecolumn is based on
the assumption that allowing concealed
carry by sane, law-abiding adults is "bad."
The fact is, the people who are licensed to
carry concealed handguns in this country
...

are, statistically, far less likely to commitany

type ofcrime than the population as a whole.
Preventing licensed people from carrying
handguns in particular locations does nothing more than make their lives more complicated, while destroying the deterrence
effect towardreal criminals at these places.
The theory is very simple. If a criminal
is somewhere that people are allowed to
carry concealed handguns, every potential
victim is also potentially armed and can
fight back. Telling the honest people in this
country that they shouldn'tbe able to protect themselves, in a church of all places,
is backward thinking and will cost lives.

To the Editor:
Occasionally I am asked to consider
signing a petition whenpeople are tabling
at Sharpies. However, I never have
enough information or the time to contemplate the issue when standing at the
table so that I can make the decision
whether to support the issue.
For instance, a recent proposal that I
was asked to support would provide $1
billion for shelters for women. I am in
support of spending money on such
causes. However, my support is not limitless. The time over which this money
would be spent was not specified, so I
could not begin to consider whether this
would be an appropriate amount for the
government to spend on shelters for
women.
In most cases, I think it is a bad idea to
petition an issue that has not been presented to the college community beforehand. It would be better if people petitioning an issue publicized their position
beforehand by putting signs around campus, stuffing mailboxes or holding meetings on the issue. It would be even better
if flyers had references to opposing arguments and rebuttals to these opposing
arguments.
These changes would allow me to make
a more informed decision about whether
to support these issues when presented
with a petition at Sharpies.

A hopeful
farewell
It gets tiring to listen to me complain
all the time, don't it? So I decided, I've
spent enough energy causing a ruckus
about other Swatties' ill-conceived opinions and the inadequacies of this institution. Instead, I will use my last
Swarthmore article to give Swarthmore
the due praise it deserves: this college has
brought together the soulful, complex and
multi-talented friends who will always
stay in my heart.
More accurately, I thank all the students
ofcolor in Swarthmore history whopressed
the Admissions Office and Senior Staff to
aggressively recruit and admit more students of color. In particular, I thank the
members of the Classes of 1996 to 1999, and
the previous Dean of Admissions Carl
Wartenberg and his staff for recruiting and
admitting me and my classmates —producing the largest entering class and largest
student of color population ever at
Swarthmore. It was as if Wartenberg gave
one last gift to the college and to me by helping to create the Class of 2000 before he
passed away, never having gotten a chance
to meet the fruits of his labor.
Those upperclassmen whorecruited the
Class of 2000, and the students of color of
my class, are at the heart of what I have
called "community" for these past four
years. This community held my hand
along a difficult journeyof professors who
didn't understand how I learned, course
reading about our society that didn't reveal the truth and an academic program
that didn't recognize and incorporate the
fact that most student learning occurrs in
the context of life experiences prior to
Swarthmore and in activities outside of
the classroom.
I fear, however, the phenomenon and
dynamism that we call "the Class of 2000"
may be the last of its kind at Swarthmore.
This supportive culture of friendship was
formed in part by the Admissions policy
created by Wartenberg's office and college community pressures. But, after we
graduate, I wonder if the faculty, senior
staff and Admissions Office will have the
will to press for greater interaction with
and visibility in the racial minority-dominated urban public schools
the schools
where the average student is not from the
upper-middle class. Will people like me
disappear and become relegated only to
being the few Evans and Lang scholars?
In the future, will people like me not have
the opportunity to learn the elite culture
of academic and class power that
Swarthmore reproduces so well?
I hope not. I hope that this college community will not decide that just a handful
of "Jennys" or those who share my
struggles will be enough to satisfy this
institution's privileged taste for "diversity." I hope that more people like me will
be admitted so that this school will finally
cave in to pressures that demandfor Asian
American studies and ethnic studies. It's
nice to hear a final dose of hopefulness
and positivity from me about cultural politics, isn't it?
Remember: the revolution will not be
televised. Listen to the static.

FINDING
the

right

balance

making athletics and academics work together
BY MIN LEE WITH SONIA SCHERR AND NATHAN ASHBY-KUHLMAN

Finding

an appropriate place for non-intellectual activities at an institution
that professes to be one of the most cerebral places in the world has always been an

immensely challenging and delicate task.

But a whole host of recent developments among them the rapid decline in athletic performance at the college and increasing recruiting pressure on coaches have rendered the need
to find the right balance between academic and athletic excellence especially acute of late,
precipitating an identity crisis of sorts. Last December, President Al Bloom asked the Board of Managers to establish the Athletic Review Committee (ARC), a group charged with the broad mission of
reviewing the role and impact of athletics at Swarthmore and charting its future course.

In the second installment of a two-part series, The Phoenix takes an in-depth look at the larger debate over
Swarthmore's athletic program the issues at stake, the policy implications and the future prospects.
Over 40 interviews with various members of the community reveal that while there is an almost unanimous consensus on the broader mission of the college, precisely what kind of relationship between our athletic and academic
institutions that mission translates into is the source of great contention. The debate is best characterized as a difficult

negotiation between the deep-seated intellectual values of Swarthmore and the changing realities of modern collegiate athletics.

Soul-Searching at

Swarthmore

Swarthmore has come a long way from the days of former
president Frank Aydelotte in the earlier part of the twentieth century, when athletics were deemed purely recreational.
But even with the emergence of a competitive athletics
program and the college's recognition of the educational
value of that program, it remained deeply committed to
the amateur ideal. In a 1960 speech, former president
Courtney Smith warned of the growing professionalization
of student athletics in higher education. Citing passages
from Aristophanes' "The Clouds," Smith painted a picture
of athletics that complemented the educational program
by easing the rigors of academic work and instilling in students important values such as teamwork and discipline,
but never overwhelmed it.
"In an educational institution the books come first," he
concluded, "but the good books will tell you that they welcome not standing alone."
This idealby and large rings true today. The mission statement of the Physical Education and Athletic Department
still dwells on the same themes that Smith articulated 40
years ago. And it is a vision with which most members of
the community share and identify. In conversations with
Phoenix reporters, students, faculty and administrators
alike spoke of the "balancing" effect of athletics as an "outlet for stress," as well as its crucial role within the larger
educational philosophy of the college. All the student-athletes profiled in the first installment of the series emphasized that they were students first, athletes second. Many
coaches were drawn to the college precisely because of its
pure amateur quality. Lee Wimberly, head coach of the
men's basketball team, who took a leave of absence two
years ago to serve as the head scout of the NBAs San Antonio Spurs, made a conscious choice to keep his coaching
career within the liberal arts college circuit. He started
his career at Pomona, because he "felt their priorities were
in the right place," before moving on to Swarthmore 14
years ago. "I didn't want to be at a place where the tail
wagged the dog," he said.
But just how exactly and to what degree athletics should
play second fiddle to the academic program here is a question that Swarthmore has grappled with constantly throughout its history and continues to struggle with today. It is a
sensitive issue about which complete candor is uncharacteristically absent on a campus known for its outspokenness.
Indeed, numerous professors either denied or ignored requests for interviews. Several students requested anonym-

ity as a condition of being interviewed. Almost all the subjects interviewed for the story asked to review their quotes.
From 1975 to 1984, Swarthmore boasted a football record
that would make Notre Dame proud. Under the stewardship of former head coach Tom Lapinski, the Garnet Tide
completed a formidable 30-6 run, taking two Centennial
Conference championships along the way and making frequent appearances in national rankings. Lapinski is still
the all-time winningest coach in the conference. But the
unprecedented feat came to an abrupt end when Lapinski
left the program in 1985. Rumors have surfaced since then
suggesting that Lapinski was fired because he won too many
football games. But according to various sources familiar
with the situation, Lapinski left because of a widerange of
reasons. One of these reasons had to do with the fact that
he recruited players of a certain background who did not
feel comfortable at the college, and, in spite of that, he did
not try to integrate the team with the rest of the community.
The controversy surrounding Lapinski's departure aside,
the episode at the very least points to a tension between
the character of the college and the culture of competitive
athletics. Lapinski tended to create a "siege mentality"
among his football players, according to a source. Even
though the football team managed to maintain a mixed
record in the immediateaftermathof Lapinski's departure,
soon the Garnet Tide barely caused as much as a ripple.
"Swarthmore, where football's just for fun," read the title
of a Philadelphia Inquirer article on the woes of the football team. In 1995, Swarthmore began what would become
the longest losing streak in college football at the time. At
the end of a winless '97 -'9B season, fresh from a mass exodus of players, the football program looked as if it had run
its course.
But theadministration intervened to resuscitate the program, bringing in current head coach Pete Alvanos and expanding the football budget. Bloom in particular was deeply
moved by the poignant stories he heard whiletraveling with
the football team in California two years ago and spearheaded the revitalization efforts.
While Swarthmore did finally end the losing streak early
last fall with a lopsided win over Oberlin in a match many
consider to be a somewhat orchestrated contest (the college even ordered an extra set of goalposts in anticipation
of the win), other members of the community began to have
second thoughts about the re-emergence of athletics into
the spotlight. The Faculty Advisory Committee to the Dean
of Admissions, as well as faculty members not on the com-

mittee, became concerned about the growing number of
admissions decisions that took athletic talent into consideration.
And even despite football's mini-revival, other sports
were still lagging. Men's athletics in particular have suffered badly, witnessing a sharp drop in their Centennial
Conference record in the past five years and an alarming
decline in the level of participation. The feelings of
lessness and defeat once exclusive to football players have
begun to manifest themselves across the board, as the previous installment in the series documented.
At the same time, the college has begun to feel the brunt
of the shifting face of collegiate athletics. Changes in NCAA
Division 111 legislation expanded the so-called non-traditional season, allowing for more contests in each individual
sport and encouraging the one-sport focus. The prevalence
of specialization in general in high school and collegiate
athletics meant that schools could no longer count on multisport athletes. This in turn placed a heavier burden on admissions to admit more athletes.
Specialization also goes hand-in-hand with the gradual
disappearance of talented "walk-ons," student-athletes who
were not recruited. "We used to be able to depend on students who would just show up and make our teams," said
Director of Athletics Bob Williams, "but people aren't just
showing up anymore they're recruited and wooed to other
schools." Neither does it help that many of Swarthmore's
counterparts, including those in the Centennial Conference,
are stepping up recruiting efforts. To lure potential student-athletes, these schools are "creatively packaging" financial aid packages
which often include merit-based
aid packages
in ways that are inconceivable at
Swarthmore, as one coach put it. Many Swarthmore coaches
are already trying to compensate by spending more than
half their time recruiting.
With all these factors vying for attention, President Bloom
decided to ask the Board for a bit of institutionalized soulsearching, which eventually saw the creation of the AP r^ m

Admissions and Athletics
A major focal point of the debate is an admissions policy
known commonly as "slotting."
Talk to different people familiar with the practice, and
you will yield a range of definitionsof slotting. Some coaches

of a prospective student-athlete whootherwise might be less

likely to get in given the low percentage of qualified students admitted to Swarthmore overall. Dean of Admissions
Robin Mamlet explained the version of slotting she approves
of: hypothetically speaking, if candidates A and B are competing for a spot, all things being equal, if both candidates
share the same special intellectual quality that Swarthmore
looks for, then the slottedcandidate will have a better chance
of gaining admission. In other words, the slotting system
simply gives an extra boost to a candidate that would otherwise have a fair shot at getting in. The admissions office
does not "dip"
the common admissions parlance for lowering academic standards for student-athletes. "In order
for a kid to be slotted, it has to be a kid who has to be great
for Swarthmore anyway," said Mamlet.
The slotting system, first introduced by Mamlet when
she arrived on the job two years ago, marks the first systematic attempt to address the needs of athletic teams in
the admissions process. In the past athletic talent was factored into admissions decisions as well, but in a much more
haphazard way. Under the new system, the athletic teams
are allocated a total of 120 slots. The distribution of slots
across sports is decided by an internal committee within

"We can have a healthy
range of excellent, competitive intercollegiate
programs. The question
is, how many?" asked

President Al Bloom.

the athletics department. Currently the football team receives half the slots, a total of 60 places. The original idea
was to rotate slots from sport to sport, according to Director Williams, but the initial set of spots never strengthened
the targeted sports, so the present distribution still remains.
Slotting is highly indicative of the distinctiveness of
Swarthmore, especially when it is compared to admissions
practices at other schools. A recent report issued by the
faculty at Amherst revealed that in recent years, prospective students with high athletic ratings were significantly
more likely to be admitted than prospective non-studentathletes, especially among students with lower academic
ratings. Amherst president Tom Gerety openly admitted
to the Amherst student newspaper, The Amherst Student,
that the drop in standards can partly be attributed to efforts to rebuild the football team. Such an admission by
President Bloom would be unimaginable. At Swarthmore,
an almost puritanical insistenceof never subordinating the
academic and intellectual agenda to anything else still persists.
Which is also why slotting, while supposedly creating a
convenience for coaches, often turns out to be a headache
instead. A slot is not a guaranteed acceptance. Take football, for example the program has never been granted
its full capacity of 60 admittances.
In the recruiting process, coaches used a rough set of
guidelines provided by the admissions office, including
certain quantitative measures such as board scores and
grades, to determine the recruitability of prospective student-athletes. In some cases they send in actual transcripts
to the admissions office and ask for feedback. But the problem is admissions decisions are based on a set of criteria, if
they can be defined at all, that are above and beyond the
quantifiables. Bloom and Mamlet are adamant "that the
college must hold to the standard of admitting only those
applicants in whom the admissions office perceives potential to thrive in our academic program, a passion for learning and eagerness to be part of a community which is committed to intellectual pursuit and to placing that pursuit in
the service of a better world." And these special qualities
can only be gleaned from the entire application, including
essays and recommendations, not just grades and scores,
said Mamlet. While she often sees a correlation between
scores and the qualities Swarthmore looks for, she thinks

that, "For all applicants, scores give only part of the pic-

ture; some applicants have very high scores and do not
possess the qualities we look for in Swatties, while other
candidates have relatively low scores and would still be
wonderful students and citizens here."
And of course, coaches are not privy to the entire application package. Therefore many situations arise in which
prospective student-athletes, who, on the basis of their transcript, may receive positive comments from theadmissions
office, end up not being in contention at all. Alvanos recalls how, at the University of Chicago, where lie previously coached football, the admissions office "would look
for all the positive reasons to take an athlete. Their admissions office looked at it as 'Can this kid do the work, not
can this kid meet the profile?'"
Certain coaches speculate whether that "profile" also
happens to be the profile that the U.S. News and World Report rankings are looking for and does, in fact, include increasingly higher board scores. But contrary to popular
perception, SAT scores of students have not risen significantly. Students admitted to the class of 2003 had an average combined SAT of 1440, compared to 1420 of the admitted class of 1999.
Regardless of whether Swarthmore's desired profile is
based merely on scores or not, it is abundantly clear to everyone that prospective students who meet the profile and
have athletic talent constitute a very finite pool.
"There are not a lot of them out there, and the ones that
are out there everyone wants," said Alvanos. And colleges
who need those students the most to improve their programs are also least attractive to them. Swarthmore
coaches often lose students to institutions with better athletics programs such as Williams or Amherst and the Ivy
League schools.
"It's my sense that Swarthmore College is the hardest
place to recruit in the country from a coaching viewpoint,"
said Karen Borbee, head coach of women's field hockey
and lacrosse.
Most importantly, despite the fact that students can be
strong both athletically and academically, at some level
there is a tradeoff, as every person interviewed agreed
unequivocally. Coach Alvanos suggests that Swarthmore

Community Building

is not even targeting the same student-athlete as Williams or Amherst. A popular targeted profile of his is
someone who would not necessarily be able to start at
an Ivy League school, but at Swarthmore would probably start as a freshman, and if accepted at the Ivy
would choose to go there and choose not to play at all.
"Is that person truly a good athlete?" Alvanos wondered.
"At some point we have to start talking about talent,"
he said. Even with the implementation of slotting, the
football team has still been held to that single win over
Oberlin.

One of the much neglected purposes of athletics at
Swarthmore is community building, which is, in fact, included in the athletic department mission statement. But
the athletic institutions at Swarthmore are often accused
of detracting from a common sense of community.
Brendan Nyhan 'OO has noticed a growing phenomenon
of self-segregation among athletes, citing evidence such
as athletes-only e-mail lists and parties. The nature of
organized sports are also inherently insular, said Nyhan.
Many teams require up to two weeks of pre-season before school starts, for example.
Bob Gross, dean of the college and a member of the
ARC, takes a more flexible approach. "We are a community of subcommunities," he said. The nature of groups,
at least healthy groups is such that "they exist, but they
have permeable membranes." He hopes to explore how
permeable those membranes are as part of his work for
the committee.
But what may lie at the center of the absence of community around athletics at Swarthmore may be an inherent incompatibility between Swarthmore culture and
athletic culture, which is an integral part of mainstream
American culture.
One of the questions posed by the ARC asks, "What
are the 'opportunity costs' of recruiting athletes vs. admitting otherapplicants?" Imagine Duke questioning the
"opportunity cost" of accepting Grant Hill as a student.
"There's something in [the] Swarthmore spirit that permeates the atmosphere of Swarthmore that is fundamentally against mainstream culture in general, and that includes athletics," said Delonte Gholston 'O2, who doesn't
play a sport.
No matter how hard Alvanos tries to integrate the football program into campus life, he always seems to run up
against a brick wall. Alvanos worked hard to try to make
football games an event, bringing in a high school marching band and inviting faculty members to "guest coach,"
but whether the impact is lasting remains to be seen.
Strains of these differences were easily noticeable in
conversations with different members of the community.
Non-student-athletes and professors readily downplay
the importance of winning as part of a healthy athletic
experience.
"It's not just about being close and scoring a touchdown," said Alvanos, "it's about winning and feeling you
have a chance to win."
On the other hand, Christine Leahey 'OO, who found
her friend Carlo Fitti's 'OO decision to stick with football
despite the odds highly admirable, seemed befuddled
when asked by the interviewer whether she realized how
painful the losing streak might have been for Fitti.
"Having a winning team can never be the highest priority," said Rose.
Asked whether the college should phase out chronically losing teams, JohnDolan 'O2, who does not participate in athletics, replied, "It would still be better to have
a lovable losing team that we all appreciate and use for
social purposes or exercise or desire to play the sport...
than to not have the sport at all."
But nonetheless, the incompatibility of Swarthmore and
mainstream culture is no excuse for the lack of acceptance of student-athletes, counter athletes and coaches.
"To take pride in my sport," said one student-athlete
who asked to remain anonymous, "isn't something I
should be ashamed about." The student is transferring
to Williams because of its superior athletic program. He
hopes to fulfill his longtime goal of becoming an AilAmerican athlete next year. It's a goal he must try to
fulfill in his college days, said the student-athlete, or else

Academics vs. Athletics: Is There a Trade-off?
Many outstanding student-athletes do exist at

Swarthmore, but because of the premium it places on

preserving its unique intellectual qualities, Swarthmore
can only reconcile academics and athletics at an institutional level on a very particular set of terms, the consensus seems to be. Even granted that, the perception of
those terms varies from person to person.
While the coaches are still trying to pinpoint what exactly defines a Swattie, some students and faculty members are complaining that the admissions office is compromising its essence, that it is in fact deviating from its
stated definition of slotting.
"I would be shocked if that was an accurate description of what's happening," said psychology professor
Barry Schwartz.
Classics professor Gil Rose is also among the dissenters. "The danger is by putting resources of various sorts
into the intercollegiate program, we are jeopardizing to
some extent other things that we value and we should
value even more than the opportunity to play other colleges in sports," he said.
"I think it's proper for Swarthmore given its characteristics and values to place a very high priority on intellectual curiosity and commitment to intellectual life,"
said economics professor John Caskey, who advocates
the gradual phasing out of the football team, "and that
means unavoidably you're putting a lower priority on
some of these other things."
Often deeply interlaced in these arguments is a careful cost-benefit analysis. Rose has heard about and recognizes the important lessons learned on the playing
field, but other extracurricular activities foster the
same values, he suggested. At some point we have to
question, "Is it worth the investment we're putting in?"
said Rose.
Some of the dissenters believe that the educational
value of athletics is overrated at best. "Educational?"
Rose wondered out loud when asked about the educationalpurpose of athletic competition. "Give me a break!
I'm having a good experience, but educational?"
"Sports is not connected to my intellectual experience here," said Rohan Hoole 'OO plainly. "What's that
got to do with our education, really?" he asked. "It's a
hobby."
But no one is questioning the academic competence of
student-athletes although the ARC will be examining
athlete participation in the honorsprogram and their academic performance. Rather, they are making the case
for an extra intellectual spark.
"There are football players who are very intellectual
and very creative," Hoole emphasized, "and there are
also a lot of them who are not and are just smart people
who work very hard."

or Unbuilding?

regret it for the rest of his life. But the unsatisfactory
state of Swarthmore athletics aside, he still finds
Swarthmore an ideal school. "Swarthmore offers me
most of the things I want in a college," he said, "so I
wouldn't mind coming back here."
"The college prides itself on diversity," said Sue Davis,
longtime head coach ofboth the men's and women's swim
teams, "but diversity in the form of athletics is not part
of its diversity."
"A lot of people are stuck in their head, and there's
nothing wrong with being stuck in your head, especially
in an institution like this that values being stuck in your
head," said the anonymous student-athlete, "but people
have to allow for the fact that not everyone's the same.
Some people like to work hard not just in academics but
also in athletics."

«

Solutions and Future Prospects
Many interviewed for this article, including adminis-

trators and faculty, proposed the phasing out of several

intercollegiate sports. Swarthmore does in fact field an
extraordinary number of teams for a school of its size.
Johns Hopkins, more than twice the size of Swarthmore,
fields the same number.
Caskey suggested that, by focusing on sports that are
more individual, many of the lingering issues will be resolved. "Just by chance you're going to get someone who,
let's say, runs cross country, you may by chance get someone here who's a truly outstanding cross country runner
and that person can go ahead and run and run competitively without other people who are also competitive."
"Maybe we can't have the breadth of programs that
Williams or Amherst can offer," said Bloom, "but I certainly believe that with a student body of 1375, we can
have a healthy range of excellent, competitive intercollegiate programs. The question is, how many?"
Another committee on athletics, chaired by Caskey and
staffed by several coaches including Borbee, convened
two years ago as part of the long-range planning process
and made the same recommendation.
But cutting sports is bound to disappoint many involved, not the least of whom is athletic director Bob
Williams, who himself agrees with the assessment. "The
last thing an athletic director wants to talk about is the
elimination of sports."
Asked if football is one of the sports where a harmonious balance can be achieved, President Bloom answered
also with a cost-benefit analysis line ofreasoning. "Increasing specialization requires that to be competitive in a sport,
a large proportion of the team needs to be made up of
students who have already developed considerable talent
in that sport," he said. "Yet there are only a certain number of admissions places in which the college can take
such talent into account, as compared to the diverse range
of talents we look for in building a class."
"We have all these wonderful kids who are intellectually passionate [on the football team]," he continued,
but we've won one game in three years," noting similarly disappointing results in soccer and basketball.
In any case, come December, when the ARC is due to
make its recommendations, the campus community
should brace itself for a contentious debate.
In fact, Caskey's committee was so concerned about
the potential backlash of its proposals that it recommended that the implementation process, in order to
counter "special interest opposition," must "include a
carefully orchestrated political campaign to convince the
alumni, the Board of Managers and others of the wisdom of the proposed action."

Southern fried funk: Nelly's 'Country Grammar'.
A unique style makes
rapper the next big thing
By Scott Kushner
Phoenix Staff
Imagine this. You're twenty
years old. You've never really
had a place to call home, as you
were born in Texas but moved to
Spain and now you reside in the
ghettos of St. Louis. Growing up
as the youngest kid in your neighborhood, you were always getting into trouble with the older
boys. You bounced around from
family member to family member and from school to school,
trying to get settled down, but
stability doesn't find you until
you find the game of baseball.
Baseball keeps you focused so
that you are immune to the distractions of the city streets.
You're so good in fact that you
have the ability to play professionally. So what do you do when
you're presented with offers to
play? You turn them all down so
you can start a rap group with
some of your high school buddies. Probably not the wisest
choice you could make
unless
you make it big.
For St. Louis rapper Nelly, this
decision could not have been
more real. In 1996, Cornell Hayes
Jr. (a.k.a. Nelly) and five friends
known as the St. Lunatics
(Kyjuan, City Spud, Murphy Lee,
Ali and Jason) independently released their first single "Gimme
What Ya Got." The single was a
huge success locally, selling an
impressive 7,000 units en route
to becoming the number one song
on St. Louis' top hip-hop station.
After four years of struggling
to get a record deal as a group,
Nelly decided to go solo and soon
after signed with Universal
Records. His first album, "Country Grammar," is due out shortly,
and if early indications are correct, it could be an enormous hit.
His first single "Country Grammar (Hot Sh*t)" has already broken into Billboard's Top 10 rap
singles; the video is scheduled to
appear on BET next week.

Orleans rapper/"actor"/producer/basketball player/"sports

'Macbeth' au naturel 'Keeping the Faith' a fresh debut
By Justin Kane
Phoenix Staff
Getting primitive. Goingau
naturel. Running with the
wolves. Regardless of the
name, there is something refreshing, something essential
about the return to nature. We
shed our city skins
our aspiring politico trench coats,
our schmoozy chit-chat and
and
pretentious facades
slither into something a little
more comfortable. Which is
precisely why I was intrigued
to hear that the upcoming production of Shakespeare's
"Macbeth" will be staged in
Scott Amphitheater.
It's appropriate, certainly
art and nature are like the
wine and cheese of the culture
world: proven winners when
done right, but unpalatable
when the host makes the
wrong choices. Fortunately,
the amphitheater is an excellent choice
the straightlaced tulip poplars and gray
stone leave the audience feeling appropriately dwarfed,
and Crum Woods as backdrop
inspires a certain Crusoe-like
desire to make a go of it in the
wild.
And "Macbeth" isn't a bad
choice, either. As directorAndrew Bryce 'OO pointed out,
"Macbeth" is a play about "primal forces of nature and atavistic lusts," and the character of Macbeth is himself an
emotional least common denominator, wracked by the
most primitive and furious
passions.
The
combination
of
"Macbeth" and Scott Amphitheater gives the cast and
crew a lot to aspire to, and aspire they do. Eben Myers 'Ol
fills the titlerole, literally. His
intimidating stature brings the
enormous amphitheater down
to a reasonable size, and in this
space he gives a reserved but
intense performance. His
Lady Macbeth (Liane Rice 'O3)
is a perfect counterpart, diminutive and seemingly fragile but brimming with fury and

evil and later, with guilt. The
two play off each other well,
although Rice occasionally
dominates their exchanges.
Steve Salter 'O2 plays
Banquo to the hilt, first gregarious as Macbeth's companion and later chilling, if a bit
overwrought, as the specter
of Banquo returned to haunt
the newly crowned Macbeth.
Marvin Barron 'O2 puts on an
admirable performance as
King Duncan, the affable but
aged monarch whose kindliness is rewarded with murder.
As one of Duncan's porters,
Laura Pyle 'OO steals a delightful scene during the second
act, drunkenly lecturing
Macduff (David January 'O3)
and Lennox (Danielle Masor
'O3) on the pleasures and dangers of drinking. The episode
is the strongest incarnation of
a subtle thread of humor that
runs through the production.
The cast as a whole is solid
if not spectacular, at times
battling to make themselves
heard over the power of both
the amphitheater and the play
itself. The crew, led by Bryce
and assistant director Jessica
Nakamura 'O3, seems to adopt
the "if you can't beat them,
join them" strategy for dealing with the amphitheater,
keeping the set, lighting and
sound to a minimum. The tactic works on and off, sometimes highlighting the intersection of natural and artistic
beauty and at other times
drowning the actors, who did
much of their practicing in the
Hicks Mural Room, in the
green expanse that surrounds
them.
In the end, "Macbeth," the
final show of Bryce's long theater career at Swarthmore, is,
like the old wine-and-cheese
standby, a proven winner.
While all elements of the production do not come together
perfectly, it's difficult to deny
the overwhelming appeal of
two fundamentals of human
nature, art and nature,
Shakespeare and the amphitheater.

It's the age-old joke: A rabbi
and a priest walk into a bar... only
this time, it's been stretched into
a screenplay, and it is both the
freshest of a barrage of new romantic comedies and Edward
Norton's directing debut. "Keeping the Faith" is the story of three
childhood chums and the forbidden love triangle that forms between them. It begins with an
image of Norton that we know all
too well: leaning heavily on the
bar in a dimly lit pub, disheveled
and heavy-eyed. Norton slurs
drunkenly at the bartender, who
is surprised when Norton unzips
his coat and reveals his collar.
That's right, this time the musing Norton is a priest; Father
Brian Finn, to be exact.
And it just so happens that his
best friend, played hilariously by
Ben Stiller, is Rabbi Jacob
Schramm. Friends since childhood, the two men have remained
close, each pursuing a career in
his respective religious sect.
Both Father Finn and Rabbi
Schramm have turned their congregations upside down, sermonizing with a "SisterAct"-ish twist
and drawing in crowds from the
street. Despite religious divisions, the two are bound together
by their love of God and each
other. Seemingly inseparable, the
best friends play basketball,
schmooze and formulate plans to
unite the Gentiles and the Jews,
including a non-denominational
karaoke bar.
The only thing missing from
the picture is Anna, the third
musketeer, their tomboy junior
high friend, who, having moved
away, has been out of the picture

Tarble

for years. Until one day, seemingly out of the blue, Brian gets
a call from Anna, who will be in
New York for business and would
like to reconnect. So the rabbi
and the priest walk into the airport and are confronted by their
friend, who's now a total fox.
As luck would have it, both
men are single, one because of
his vows, the other as a result of
too many botched blind dates arranged by forceful Jewish mothers. And they both fall for Anna,
who, 15 years prior, seemed like
one of the guys. Obviously, the
tug-of-war that ensues and an insane amount of miscommunication causes conflict in the friendship triangle. There's nothing
like a disputed pretty lady to
spoil that ol' male bonding.
Knowing the effects that an
intimate relationship would have
on the men's relationship, Jacob
and Anna, having become romantically involved, agree to keep
things on the down low. Not only
would Brian be weirded out by
their new interaction, but Jacob's
image would also suffer. What
would the council of rabbis who
are considering Jacob's promotion think of his dating a (gasp!)
blond, blue-eyed Gentile girl? So
they sneak around, concealing
their relationship, all the while
falling in love and getting themselves in deeper than they really
want to be.
For the most part, the story line
is good and relatively well-developed. The dialogue, however,
could use a little reworking and
a 15-minute cut would have done
wonders for the audience members, who were shifting restlessly in their seats, trying to revive their napping derrieres.
Similarly, the tone could have

Courtesy TOUCHSTONE PICTURES

stood some revamping, since it
tended a little too much toward
the larkish and sitcomesque.
Still, to avoid sounding too embittered, and to refrain from taking out the stress I've built up
over the course of the semester
on this harmless flick, I have to
say that "Keeping the Faith" was
not all bad. It had its share of
charm and humor. The acting
wasn't bad, per se, and the plot
was far from predictable, maintaining throughout the intriguing
and complicated dance between
religion and personal belief.

I was really tempted to ask him to show me how
to take some risks, but I refrained. Instead, I asked
him about the change in the pickle policy because
two years ago the pickles were only distributed by
the people working behind the counter at Tarble.
Joe told me that people started getting jealous when
they received one pickle instead of two or three.
Overall, Tarble Joe was disappointingly positive,
whichmakes me believe that true bitching can only
come from within. From within the bubble we hear
things like "If only everyone here were as pretty

that all the decent men already have boyfriends."

to as Tarble Joe and works at Essie Mae's snack
bar.
There is no doubt that people are flattered when
they receive a flower shaped piece of tomato or
compliments on their haircut from Joe. But the
praise continues with touching stories like this one
of Lupe Jimenez '00: "One time I asked for a tuna
hoagie and Joe said, 'You want oregano on that,
right?' and I answered 'no thanks.' He replied, 'No,
you do. Trust me.' And ever since then I have
oregano on my tuna hoagie."
I asked Joe what he thought of Swarthmore students. "When I first started working here I had
heardthat Swarthmore had a lot of freaks," he said,
"but everyone here is pretty nice." If Joe had any
complaints about our student body it was that
"people need to relax a little more and be more
spontaneous. Sometimes I say hello to people and
they don't know how to handle it."
I tried explaining that we are i
simply surprised with such abWant to have a great job that is FUN, PAYS, FEEDS,

Ultimate players and alumni attempt superhuman feats of gluttony
of around 25 alumni and 20 cur-

Imran Posner, Jeremy Slezak and Charlie Ellis challenge for the frisbee.

Good things come in

rent students.

On Saturday the Earthworms
and Warmothers stayed home at
Swat for a change, while alumni
who had played Ultimate in years
past came to the hallowed field
of Mertz for one epic battle:
alumni versus students. In addition to this Manichean contest,
there was a contest to see who
could drink half a gallon of chocolate milk the fastest.
The alumni came from as far
away as Modesto, Calif. (Peter
Vella '96), or as close as the Ville
of Swarthmore (Tim Heffernan,
who graduated in December).
Heffernan, Vella, and the other
alums had a joyous reunion lasting late into the afternoon. Other
former Swatties included Imran
Posner '99, Roger Bock '99, Dave
Lewis '9B, Mandy Hourihan '9B,
Gabby Kruks-Wisner '9B, Cathy
Worth '97, and others for a total

Before the alumni-students
match-up, the annual Callahan
Challenge took place. While the
contest usually involves eating a
quarter pound of beef jerky and
then drinking half a gallon of
chocolate milk in under ten minutes, the beef jerky was forgone
this year to keep the players out
of the hospital. This year's contenders were Vince Pallaver 'OO,
Daniel Schwartz 'Ol, and Paul
Wulfsberg 'O3.
Pallaver was off to a quick start
before slowing down to a crawl
after about five minutes. Video
footage later showed that Margaret Parker 'OO and Nate Schaffran
'OO aided Pallaver illegally by
drinking some of the chocolatey
goodness, disqualifying him from
the contest. Pallaver did win the
iron stomach award, though, for
going back onto the field after ten
minutes for all-out Ultimate re-

plete with bids.
Schwartz struggled even more,
getting only halfway through his
Nestle Quik before starting to feel
ill. It tookSchwartz more than ten
minutes to finally drink his two
quarts, whereupon he retired to
his room for the day. The winner,
frosh upstart Wulfsberg, washed
his tasty beverage down in about
100 seconds, amazing onlookers
with his gluttony. Wulfsberg then
lay down onto the ground for a
while with a distant gaze on his
face before returning to the
Willets Ist South bathroom to do,
well, what people normally do in
the Willets Ist South bathroom.
He was back on the playing field
shortly thereafter, though, claiming the Callahan Challenge Championship.
The previously briefly mentioned Manichean contest between students and alumni was
won by the forces of good (the
students) by a score of 21-14.

Rugby

outpoints No. 2 Princeton

|y Joanne Jacobson, Payal Shah
ind Shannon McGrael
or The Phoenix
The women's rugby team cultivated an undefeated season
vith an 11-8 victory on Saturday
igainst the second-ranked team in
he nation, Princeton University.
[hey finished the season 7-0.
"The name of the game was
teamwork," said team captain
Rhiana Swartz 'OO. "Every single
person contributed something
critical. It was incredible the
pinnacle of my rugby career and
of our team's performance."
Princeton jumped out to an
early lead in the first half, but,
like true champions, the Swat
spirit remained strong. A few
minutes into the second half, the
team responded.
With a textbook penalty kick,
Swartz booted the ball out of
bounds, bringing the team within
inches of Princeton's try line. After Swat won the lineout, a scrum
was formed. The ball was passed
out to the backs, and Danielle
D'Olivera 'OO pitched it to
Meredith Hegg 'OO, who scored
the try. The try by Hegg knotted
the score.
The action went back and forth
for several minutes, until
Swarthmore was awarded a pen—

alty kick close to the 40-meter
line. "There was one of those
great moments in athletics when
Meghan [Brennan 'oo] andRhiana
stopped and looked at the uprights
and asked Sarah [Nusser 'o2] if
she could do it," Hegg recalls. "Of
course she could." Nusser came
through for the team, sending the
ball right through the uprights on
the long penalty kick attempt.
Princeton came right back,
though, scoring with a penalty
kick of their own to tie the score
at 8-8. After Princeton's penalty
kick, Swarthmore's swarming
defense kept Princeton from
scoring the rest of the game. It
wasn't for lack of trying, however, as Princeton's aggressive
offense approached the try line
a number of times. Led by fiery
fullback Rabi Whittaker 'O3, who
made several fierce hits near the
goal line, Swarthmore was able
to keep Princeton from putting
up any more points.
The forward pack formed an
impenetrable wall of defense, effectively getting to the ball in
rucks and malls. The front row,
comprised of Hegg, Swartz and
Taina Guarda 'O2, bound together
to work as one unit in the scrums.
With seconds left in the game,
Swat was once again awarded a
penalty kick. The fans collec-

tively held their breath while they
waited with nervous expectation.
With a calm that transcended the
tension in the air, Nusser positioned the ball, stepped back, and
sent it sailing through the uprights.
Swat had won the game, showing that they were the little team
that could.
Perhaps head coach Alan
Matas captured the moment best.
"The only thing I knew was that
I was leaning against the goal
post with tears running down my
face," he said. "I cannot remember being this proud of a team.
They played flat out, full psycho
rugby."
B-side played a tough game
against Princeton B-side, which is
also a ranked team. They lost 100. Swarthmore played well defensively, holding Princeton back
from scoring in the second half
until the last few minutes of the
game. Unfortunately, they were
unable to generate any offense
against a stifling Princeton D.
Joan Javier 'O3 played an excellent game as fly-half, establishing a great connection with
the scrum half and kicking the
ball when necessary. B-side has
come a long way this season,
holding their own against worthy

challenging, highly dynamic, and extremely relevant to the

Keep Boggs out
Generally, if you have 400 home runs, 300
wins or 3,000 hits, you're a mortal lock for
Cooperstown. I'm hoping that when 2005 rolls
around, theBaseball Writers of America will
reconsider that and throw awayWade Boggs'
key. Yes, Boggs got to the 3,000 hit plateau
and won five batting titles. So what? He was
essentially the Dave Kingman of hits, with
far less character. Boggs was selfish and
slow. He didn't hit for power, didn't sign autographs and had a number of instances
where his shady character was more than
exposed.
Now Boggs certainly wasn't a terrible
baseball player. 3,000-plus hits is a whole
bunch, but that was helped out by finishing
his career with the expansion Devil Rays.
Boggs just wasn't anything special to
watch. Sure, he was a good bet to get a hit.
But he didn't score a lot of runs. He sucked
in the field and he was slower than the pope,
even in his prime.
Dave "King Kong" Kingman was a righthanded slugger whoplayed for seven teams
in his sixteen year career. Save for one
Ruthian effort (.285, 48 HRs, 118 RBIs),
Kingman was pretty muchRobDeer through
his career, a .236 career hitter who struck
out as much as I did high school (1816 times).
And what do you know? Kingman isn't in the
Hall of Fame.
So like Kingman, let's throw out Boggs'
best season (.357,24 HRs, 89 RBIs, the very
stats from the original RBI Baseball where
you always pinch-hit Tony Armas for Spike
Owen). If you throwthat season out, Boggs'
highs are 11 HRs, 78 RBIs, generally with
over 600 plate appearances. And that 11HR
season is even an outlier. For someone who
hit at the top of potent lineups, Boggs didn't
score many runs or hit for any power numbers.
He was hardly your ideal role model, either. I remember going to a game and being
in the clubhouse a couple hours before game
time. Every player signed my program, except Mike Boddicker, who was in the bullpen
warming up for his start, and Boggs, who
just said no in a very mean fashion. But my
experience with Boggs isn't the only instance
where Boggs' true colors have come through.
His four-year affair with Margo Adams, a
California woman who eventually filed a palimony suit against him, was well-documented.
He also started screaming at a flight attendant for no reason.
On the field, Boggs harassed scorers to
give him hits in place of errors. He did just
the opposite when he made an error in the
field, once costing Roger Clemens a couple
of points on his ERA, which Clemens didn't
take too kindly to. That incident and Boggs'
off-field shenanigans with Adams severely
affected Red Sox clubhouse chemistry. In
that regard, Boggs was generally a huge
negative throughout his career.
Kirby Puckett, who would have gotten to
3,000 hits if he hadn't spontaneously gone
blind, deserves to be in Cooperstown a hundred thousand times more than Boggs. He
lead his team to two World Series Championships. Boggs might have beenhanded one
on his horse with the Yankees, but he never
even led the Red Sox at all. Kirby loved the
game, he was a leader and his stats are better than Boggs even if he didn't reach any
worthless magic number. Even in Beantown,
Puckett was infinitely more loved than the
wretched disease that Boggs was in the Boston clubhouse.

defeat arch-rival Haverford 7-2

By Laura Brown
Phoenix Staff
The Swarthmore women's tennis team
is now in sole possession of second place
in the conference, going 2-0 in conference
and 2-1 overall since the last update in the
Phoenix.
On April 14, Swat faced the Green Terror of Western Maryland. For the first
time in four years, Swarthmore had their
full top lineup able to attend and not suffering from illness. With everyone in attendance, the team toppled Western Maryland 6-3. Garnet women picking up the
points were the No. 3 doubles team of Kim
Tu 'O2 and Laura Brown 'OO, No. 1 singles
Jen Pao 'Ol, No. 3 singles Fran Simonds
'O2, No. 4 singles Tanya Chotibut 03, No. 5
singles JamieFlather 'OO and No. 6 singles
Brown. Tough losses came at No. 2 singles
with Laura Swerdlow 'O2 losing a tough
three-set match, No. 2 doubles team of
Flather and Katherine Voll 'O3, and the
most surprising loss at No. 1 doubles, Pao
and Swerdlow.
After the match Pao said "Laura and I
just played horribly. My forehand [normally a consistent weapon for Pao] was
sailing long and Laura was hitting too
many overheads off the court or in the
net."
Swat next faced off against a non-conference foe, The College of New Jersey,
on April 18. Swat went into this away
match missing two of their top players and
came out with a 0-9 loss. The match was
highlighted with fast-paced doubles at the
number one spot where Pao and Swerdlow
faced off against a team from TCNJ.
Swarthmore lost this match 4-8, which was
the closest of all the doubles matches (No.
2 Simonds/Brown lost 2-8, No. 3 Stacey
Wagaman 'Ol/Voll fell 1-8, No. 4 Michaela
De Soucey 'OO/Corrine Brinkley 'O2 lost 38). All of the singles matches were hard
fought, with tough losses at No. 1 where
?

Pao took a nationally-ranked player to
three tight sets and No. 4 where Brown
battled for over two and a half hours in a
tiebreak loss. The highlight of this match
was not the tennis played but the food
eaten afterwards. The players stocked up
on their carbohydrates for their opponents
the next day on excellent cuisine at Pao's
nearby home.
The next day, Swarthmore had their last
conference dual match of the season facing nemesis Haverford. Swat came out
blazing in the doubles, taking a 2-1 lead in
the match score. The No. 1 team of Pao/
Swerdlow smashed to a 8-5 win, followed
by a blowout at No. 3 where Tu/Brown
pummeled their opponents 8-3. The only
loss was a close 6-8 defeat at No. 2 with
Flather/Voll. Swarthmore knew that the
Haverford team would come out fighting
in the singles, but the team felt confident
after a few words of wisdom from the
team seniors and captains. Swat shot down
any chance of a come-from-behind
Haverford victory with three quick
straight-set wins by Swerdlow, Simonds
andFlather. Soon to follow in victory were
Brown and Pao, with straight-set wins of
their own. The only singles loss was at No.
4 with freshman Chodibut, who lost a close
match, but with experience, she is sure to
win next year.
The definite player of the day was senior Jamie Flather. Team captain Brown
remarked, "Jamie is usually noted for her
consistent play, and the inability for an
opponent to put anything away because
of her speed in getting to every ball. Today, Jamie was her usual consistent self,
plus she was applying pressure and totally
whooped her opponent 6-0, 6-0."
Swarthmore is preparing for the Conference tournament this weekend.
Swarthmore will send one doubles team
(Pao/Swerdlow) and three singles players
(Flather, Brown, and Voll) to compete in
the single and double draws.

Golf weathers tourney
Kauiman

putts to conterence record

By Ted Chan
Phoenix Staff
Matt Kaufman 'Ol, Swarthmore's
leading golfer throughout the season,
had a miserable day on Friday. Unfortunately, Friday was the first day of the
Centennial Conference Golf Championships, for whichKaufman and the rest
of the golf squad had been gearing up
all season. Thebest golfers have a short
memory, though, and Kaufman came
back on Saturday with a sparkling,
record-setting performance which
catapulted him to All-Conference honors.

Kaufman shot an 85 on the first day
of the two round tournament at Eagle's
Landing in Maryland, quite substandard for him. Extremely high winds
made the course very difficultto navigate. A mere four players broke the 80
mark on the day.
"The first round on Friday was extremely difficult. It was one of the
windiest days I've ever played golf in
my life and it was very tough to score.
I had a really bad day," said Kaufman.
But turnaboutis fair play, and on Saturday Kaufman took it to Eagle's Landing. His score of a one-under par 71
vaulted him into first place, giving him
first team All-Conference honors. The

score is also the best round ever shot
in Swarthmore and Centennial Conference history.
Kaufman did it with a steady performance in which he made very few mistakes. He hit fairways and putted well.
"Saturday was considerably better
for myself," said Kaufman, "It was one
of my best rounds ever, for sure. It's
been hard for me to keep my game in
top shape with the demands of
Swarthmore, but I know I'm as good as
any of those guys and it feels good to
prove it. I really had no pressure on
myself going in to the round, since I
basically played myself out of contention on Friday. I justplayed real steady
and made very few mistakes."
The rest of the squad which contributed to Swarthmore's solid 10-5-1 campaign did not fare as well as Kaufman
at the tournament. Overall, the team
finished sixth in the conference, a one
spot improvement over last season's
last place performance.
With all four of its top golfers returning next year, Swarthmore may be a
highly competitive team next season.
For now, they have Kaufman's tremen-

dous, record-breaking performance to
build off of. Next season, this is a squad
that may be looking for far more than
that.

Holding court

with Jen Pao
No. 1 singles player 27-2
in Centennial Conference
By Laura Brown
Phoenix Staff
"Pao wins 6-0, 6-0." Anyone who has
been around the tennis team the last few
years has probably seen, read or heard
that result a number of times. Jen Pao 'Ol
has been the Swarthmore women's tennis
team's No. 1 singles player for the past
three seasons, compiling a gaudy 27-2 conference record in singles. She has been
named to the First Team All-Conference
Team in singles and doubles for the past
two seasons and is expected to be named
again. Last year, Pao won the conference's
singles tournament, losing only six games
on her way to the title.
Pao does not fit into the stereotype of
the typical champion tennis player. This
5'3" junior, who only started playing tennis seven years ago, does not blast her
opponent off the courts. She simply returns every ball, waiting for her opponent
to make the mistake. With tremendous
quickness and endurance, Pao has the ability to run down almost any shot, especially
when she switches hands so that she is
able to play a forehand on both sides of
the court. At the 1998 Eastern Rolex
Championships, Pao made it to the semifinals before falling to the eventual champion. Pao played two three-set matches
that each lasted over three hours against
two players from Skidmore. After seeing
Jen running and getting every ball back,
i"he opposing fans remarked on her likeness to the Energizer Bunny: "She keeps
running and running and running..."
Not only has she earned her opponents'
respect on the court, but her own team values her extreme athleticism and dedication to the sport as well. If anyone a practice complains about being

nlayed in the

Goalkeeping runs in Jane Kendall's
lood. A senior from Maryland, hailed as
he lacrosse capital of the world, Kendall

is carved out a quiet reputation as one
[the nation's elite goaltenders. Kendall's

ister Nancy was an All-American, so it
natural that her coaches at Sidwell
fiends High School in Washington, D.C.
rould place her in the net.
"I guess my coaches thought
goalkeeping ran in oUr family," she said.
In addition to Nancy, Kendall's twin
Uyssa was also a star defender.
Alyssa, who attends Duke University,
ilayed defense on the lacrosse team with
fendall in high school and the two made a
wnning combination. "She was my best
fear," Kendall recalls fondly.
While Kendall may come from a talented
lacrosse family, she stands in no one's
shadow. A first team Ail-American candidate this season, she is ranked as the No. 6
'goalie in the NCAA standings for all of Division 111. In 1998, she was named to the
Brine/IWLCA Regional All-American Second Team and was placed on the All-Cenlennial Conference Second Team as well.
She is currently on the Swarthmore
women's lacrosse career record list for
saves, coming in fourth with 383 saves,
with a number of games still left to play in
her career. Kendall currently leads the
Centennial Conference with a 62.7 save percentage and 66.6 save percentage overall.
Kendall returned to Swarthmore this
past fall from Madrid, Spain, where she
studied for the '99 spring semester. Since
Kendall plays both field hockey and lacrosse, she knew that time abroad would
mean time away from one of her sports.
She chose to miss lacrosse due to the fact
that the field hockey team had no back-up
goalie. She expressed her fear of what taking a season off from athletics would do
to her. She felt her past field hockey sea?as

son reflected her fears as she did not perform as well as she had expected and
hoped. However, she felt that field hockey
helped her to readjust to the world of
sports and greatly helped to prepare her
for her upcoming lacrosse season, on
which she has been focusing.
Kendall prefers field hockey because
it's more physical: "You really have to use
your whole body." With the low scoring
games, Kendall feels that there's more
pressure than in a lacrosse game.
In lacrosse, however, Kendall says, "It's
all mental. If I let myself get frustrated,
the game is over." She feels that lacrosse
is an easier game for her mainly because
it is a faster gameand it is higher scoring.
Rhiana Swartz 'OO, a fellow athlete, pays
homage to Kendall, "Jane is the ultimate
competition one you size up before the
game and think you own, only to get completely schooled once the game starts."
Kendall, truly one of the most charming, intelligent people one could ever
meet, is a natural leader, talentedand competitive.
Kendall has always been quick to pass
on credit for her success to her coaches.

About head coach Karen Borbee, she
raves, "Karen is the reason why I came

here. When I talked to her as a pre-frosh,
she was just so down to earth, reasonable
and intelligent." Kendall admires Borbee's
philosophy: academics first, athletics second. "I think she serves as a great model
for all of Swarthmore."
Kendall chuckles a little when speaking
ofLisa Rubin, one of theassistant coaches.
"She's highly entertaining. No but seriously, I owe it all to her. She's my goalie
coach and she has an excellent shot. Her
shots are the equivalent to the best shots
I see all season."
The otherassistant coach, Kelly Wilcox,
is an alum of Swarthmore and played on
both teams with Kendall when she was a
freshman. "When I played goalie with
Kelly, she really helped me to step it up a
notch. She was a great player and is a great
coach."
Kendall'spresence will be sorely missed
when she graduates this fall. Her outlook
on life is similar to her driven, competitive spirit on the lacrosse field.
"I just want to save the world really,"
Kendall smiles.

Men's lacrosse locks down winning record
By Mike Lloyd
For The Phoenix

}

The Swarthmore men's lacrosse team
secured its first winning record since 1985
this week with a victory over Dickinson
College. On April 15 on a rain-drenched
Clothier Field, the Garnet Tide beat the
Red Devils 17-6. This latest win brings the
Garnet Tide's record to 7-5 and avenges
last year's loss to the Red Devils in

Carlisle.

The Garnet offense, which has recently
a string of several illnesses and injuries, came back to life
against Dickinson, posting their secondhighest goal total of the season.

suffered through

Swarthmore's offense controlled the flow

rftf the

game, scoring 13 goals at even
and four with a man advantage.
B lake Atkins 'O2 and Greg Nelson 'O2 did
job controlling face-offs, with
both midfielders winning 10 each and only
losing a combined 7 face-offs.
Swarthmore out-shot Dickinson 37 to 20,
with nine different players recording either a goal or an assist.
Freshmen Than Court and John Murphy

led the team to their first conference win in
two seasons, withboth playersrecording six
points. Court scored a career-high six goals
on ten shots and Murphy dished out three
assists and scored three goals for
Swarthmore. Mark Dingfield 'Ol andAdam
Dickinson 'OO both scored two goals and
threeassists. Attackman Pat Friel 'O3 played
a great game, scoring three goals and one
assist and causing several Red Devil turnovers that led to Swarthmore goals.
Not to be outdone by the offense, the
Swarthmore defense played a wellrounded game, holding Dickinson to only
six goals. Goalie Sig Rydquist 'OO continued an impressive season with 15 saves
against the Red Devils. Defensemen
Tucker Zengerle 'OO, Ford O'Connell 'OO,
and Charles Fischette 'Ol hounded the
Dickinson offense all game, forcing
Dickinson into committing many turnovers. The team also minimized mistakes,
committing only three penalties.
Even when Swarthmore was penalized,
the penalty-killing defense was powerful,
managing even to kill off a two-man disadvantage in the fourth quarter when
goalie Rydquist committed a slashing pen-

alty at the same time as Zengerle was
called for a questionable unnecessary
roughness. Mo Hernandez-Anderson 'OO,
a surprise backup goalie, helped the defense deal with the double penalty by
making two spectacular saves before
Rydquist could re-enter the game.
Sophomore midfielders Atkins and Jason Choi led the team with 9 and 8 ground
balls respectively. Both played great
games between the restraining lines and
on defense. Atkins also chipped in two
assists in the victory. Other point scorers
were Coby Smith 'O2 with a goal, Mo
Hernandez-Anderson with an assist, and
Joel Weber 'Ol with an assist.
Last week, the Garnet men lost games
to seventh-ranked Washington College 2012 and second-ranked Gettysburg College
23-7. Murphy matched his career best with
four goals against the Shoremen, while
Atkins handed out five assists. Friel
scored three goals in both games, giving
him three straight contests with hat tricks.
This Saturday the Garnet Tide plays
arch-enemy Haverford at Clothier field at
1:30. Attendance should be strong for this
match-up with theirrival.

Sometimes it seems that the only college sports are football and basketball,
with baseball thrown in here and there.
We all know that despite our very dedicated players, these are not our most successful teams, aside from the women's
basketball team.
But we don't have to turn to obscure
sports teams to be proud of our alma
mater. This past week highlighted two
powerhouse teams that are proud to call
Swarthmore home. Both the women's tennis team and the women's rugby team finished off theirregular season strong, with
wins against Haverford and number-tworanked Princeton, respectively. In fact,
rugby went undefeated this year. How
better to complete a season than with a
win over a nationally-ranked team?
Women's tennis finished 9-5, second in the
conference, and the players look to finish
well individually at conferences this weekend. I think it's safe to say that these two
teams have had the most tangible success
this spring.
But that's not to say that the other teams
have had no successes. A quick recap of
the past season (in random order):
Women's Lacrosse- Fueled by Delicious

Nuts; we've definitely surprised many

people, F&M for example. I personally
suggest attending the remaining two regular season games to watch some good lacrosse. Especially today's 4:30 game
against Haverford (Hint, hint...).
Women's Rugby- What is there to say but
that they kicked a lot of ass? That win
against Princeton was something else.
Men'sTenni- Though they started rather

slow, the Bandits have picked up the pace.

They've won all of their past four games
and are looking at Bloomsburg this week,
with NCAAs looming on the horizon.
Men's Lacrosse- I'm sure you've had all
the records thrown at you a number of
times, but the shutout against Kings' was
indeed a feat. The 6-0 opening winning
streak? Impressive. The first winning season since 1985? Only a taste of what is to
come in the next few years. Nonetheless,
it will take a win over Haverford on Saturday (1:30 at Clothier Field) to silence the
skeptics.
Baseball- I'm not going to be crass
enough to suggest that the team has had a
number of "moral victories." But the wins
against Johns Hopkins and F&M were key.
Good show.
Women'sTennis- The five losses are not
representative of how good this team is.
Three of these losses were to Division I
teams on their spring training trip and
therefore, in my opinion, are discounted.
I hereby declare their true record to be 92. Fantastic.
Softball- Considering last year's record,
the Garnet has made tremendousinroads
this season. Tuesday's win against Washington shows that they do belong in the
Centennial Conference. Props out to these
girls for the time and dedication put into
the team
it's finally paying off.

UNDEFEATED!

KENDALL SAVES THE DAY

KAUFMAN BREAKS RECORDS

Split decision
Because this is final issue of The Phoenix of the year, I am forced to choose from
a number of newsworthy topics for this
week's column. I was able to pare my
choices down to two, both of which truly
deserve their own separate recognition
but will unfortunately have to share my
column today. My apologies.
The Best Team in the Country?
If there is a team on campus that has
gotten a taste of the championship glory
that Ray experienced, it is the women's
rugby team. Last weekend, they hosted
Princeton, the number two ranked team
in the nation, and upended them 11-8 to
cap off their first undefeated season ever.
This weekend, Princeton is competing in
the "Final Four" of women's rugby. Conceivably, they could become the national
champions. The Swarthmore women, however, are still trying to get the respect and
support of our athletic department.
Don't let the term "club team" fool you.
The women ruggers are mean and nasty,
not to mention damn good. They were phenomenally successful, going 7-0 and allowing only two scores all season with many
contests being blowouts by 50, 60 or even
greater margins. With 54 people on the
team, they boast the biggest women's team
on campus.
The measly $2OOO per year allotted to
the team hardly serves as ample funding
for the team. Registration for the players
alone costs over $750. Add equipment
costs, hiring referees, van fees, etc. and it
is obvious that the $2OOO is not nearly
enough.
The rugby team is as dedicated a bunch
as you will find at Swarthmore. Four days
a week are spent practicing and Saturdays
are devoted to games (and post-game celebrations). They even subject themselves
to the most primitive forms of fund-raising, all for the right to play just seven
times in a semester. Of course, don't forget that the game ofrugby is as brutal and
vicious as you will find. Broken noses, dislocated shoulders, sprained ankles, and
torn MCLs abound; these women don't pull
punches whether in practice or during
games.
Rather than be commended and supported for their hard work and success,
the team has recently been burdened with
the fact that their field will be relegated
as a parking lot for trucks working on the
new science facility. Their new "field" is
apparently on the other side of the Crum.
Something about wading across the Crum
to get to the playing field strikes me as
ridiculous.
Finally, Swarthmore has a team to be
proud of. We have a team that is setting
the standard for excellence. We have a
team that has proven that you get back
only what you put in. The women on the
team have put forth the energy into making themselves a well-oiled ass-kicking
machine. Now it's time for the school to
put forth the energy into making sure that
they get the funds, facilities, and recognition they so richly deserve.
The Dynamic Duo
Of all the students, athletes, coaches,
administrators, and alumni, there are no
two bigger fans of Swarthmore athletics
than Dave Lester and Ray Scott. You
might know them just as Dave and Ray,
the equipment room guys, or as the two
