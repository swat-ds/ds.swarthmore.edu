Once known as the Sager Symposium,
the newly titled Queer Issues Symposium
addressed the importance of place and
identity for gay, lesbian, bisexual and
transgender people with events and workshops throughout the week.
According to the official website's
"Statement of Purpose," this year's Queer
Issues Symposium "interrogates the

Sarah Apt 'lO agreed that the Queer
Issues Symposium pushed for active
reform. "I thought the symposium was
great and I think people who weren't able
to come should talk to those who could, so
they can learn about how to mobilize
around issues and try to reform the system," Apt said.
Following the workshop, three scholars
of queer activism discussed LGBT issues
on a panel named "Queer Justice, Not
Criminal Justice: Community Organizing
against State Violence." The panel included Dean Spade, Andrea Ritchie, and
Marcellite Failla. The three considered
state and federal justice systems and their

In new role, Campbell to

assist 'strategic planning'

Children from Chester Community Charter School perform in a Dare 2 Soar in the ampitheater on Saturday.

While some have criticized the administration for not soliciting students' feedback before appointing acting dean of students Garikai Campbell '9O to a temporary administrative position, administrators claim that- the way they conducted
this appointment was normal.
President Rebecca Chopp sent an email to the official faculty-staff list last
Wednesday announcing that Campbell
who served as associate dean for academic affairs from fall of 2007 to last summer
and is a tenured professor of mathematics
will become Special Assistant to the
President and Associate Vice President
for Planning on July L While she did not
solicit input from students about this
decision or officially inform students
about this decision, Chopp said that such
measures "had not been in practice" at
the college for this type of position.
"There's nothing irregular or secret
about this," she said.
While "it's very important for students to be included" in discussions,
Chopp stressed that "it may not be feasible or practical" to solicit students' opinions for every temporary position at the
college. She added that students have
been recently involved in major college
decisions, such as three students' inclusion on the dean of students selection
committee and the inclusion of three others on the ad hoc Committee on
Purchaser Responsibility.
Often, the college has appointed faculty members to temporary positions without soliciting feedback from students or
even informing them about this decision,
Chopp said.
Provost Constance Hungerford said,
for example, that Professor of Economics
Ellen Magenheim was appointed as chair
to the Middle States Reaccreditation
Steering Committee last academic year
and Professor of Biology Rachel Merz,

when appointed to the planning and
building committee for the Science
Center, was released of her courses at the
time. Hungerford said that the administration did not solicit feedback from students before these appointments or officially inform them afterwards.
Eldridge said that Campbell's new
position "didn't require" input from students, adding, "We make decisions every
day, and we can't consult everyone."

prepare for this capital campaign. Chopp
added that this planning process was a
formal recommendation that the Ad Hoc
Financial Planning Group made to the

Board of Managers in December.
Bayer said that this strategic planning
process aims to "assess the priorities" of
the campaign and think of how the college can get donors to give money to the
college for these priorities. In other
words, Bayer said, the community asks
itself, "What are we raising money for?"
These priorities could be anything from
new facilities to financial aid.
In his new role, then, Campbell will
keep the college "focused when it comes
to strategic planning," Bayer said. "All
members of the community will be
engaged" in this process, he added.
"[My role] is really to understand
what the community is really
what
others are thinking about things, gather
those up and synthesize them," Campbell
said. "I'm not setting the vision for the
future, I'm trying to extract folks' ideas
about the vision of the future."
The administration said that this position was not designed for Campbell.
"If [Campbell] had said 'no,' we would
have looked elsewhere in the faculty,"
Eldridge said.
In fact, Chopp said that she had "been
thinking about this temporary position
for months" but had to wait until the dean
of students search process
in which
Campbell was one offour final candidates
ended in February before she could
make a decision. Bayer and Chopp said
that Campbell's salary will be provided
by a gift that has been specifically designated for strategic planning purposes.

This means, Eldridge said, that this
salary will not come out of the college's
operational budget.

Given the financial downturn in the
fall of 2008 and former President Al
Bloom's departure last spring, this capi-

tal campaign has actually been delayed
over the past two years, Chopp said.
Eldridge stressed that now "it's time" to
go through this planning process. "We
can't wait any longer," he said.
Both Hungerford and Chopp said that

this temporary position was created
because it requires an immense amount
of time that current administrators likely
would not have enough time to devote to.
"Any kind of special project is crushing," Hungerford said. "When we have a
need, we tap people."

Currently, Bell and Meng are waiting
on the completion of the bike plates
before initiating the Bike Share program. They hope to run the program for
a year and then reassess and tweak it if

necessary.
"I really do hope that it is a success
among students because I know that

there's been expressed enthusiasm and
interest in the program," Meng said.
"To me, I feel like students would appreciate this."

This change means that Family and
Friends Weekend, as well as the Crum

the spring.
During the StuCo meeting, there
was confusion expressed about
whether this would be in addition to
the current annual Parents' Weekend
or a replacement for it. Rachel Bell 'lO,
StuCo President, said, "I know that in
my experience, some students' parents
can't come for various reasons." Some
members were concerned that families, especially those who live far away,
would be unwilling to travel to campus

Anna

Since the flood-proofing,
Olde Club has not had problems with additional flooding,
Zalokostas said.
"As far as what everybody
sees
the area where you
have events and everything
that should be in good shape,"
said Bill Maguire, maintenance manger.
Flood-proofing the basement was a "pretty substantial" project, Maguire said.
Facilities had to remove a
wall, water-proofed it from
the inside, and then reconstruct it. Additionally, the
original wooden baseboards
were replaced with plastic
ones to protect against further
water leaks, Maguire said.
Zalokostas said that these
changes have added to a safer
space. For example, she said,
the old flooring contained
loose tiles that were dangerous for students walking in
Olde Club.
Louis Jargow 'lO, Olde Club

Zalokostas said.
Jargow said that getting
support from the deans for
many of the Olde Club repairs
has been difficult. The relationship between administration and Olde Club has
become "estranged," he said.
"The problem with the
administration is that' every
time we've tried to talk to
them they've said one of two
things: they've said, 'We're
not the people to be talking to'
or 'Oh, right, this is a problem, but we don't really have
the money,'" Jargow said.
Paury Flowers, assistant
coordinator of student activities, said that a lack of funds
has limited Dean's Office
involvement in Olde Club but
added that the Deans worked
with Facilities to address the
mold particularly.
"The feeling is that financial concerns being what they
are right now, our goal is to
work together with Facilities
to make sure that things in
the immediate future are
safe," Flowers said. No largescale improvements for Olde
Club are being planned as of
right now, she said.
While help from the administration

Zalokostas said that the student body

After water damage caused a mold infestation earlier this year, the basement of Olde Club has been
flood-proofed and repainted. Still, though, some problems remain.
"We were talking to a lot of

administrators, but ultimate-

ly what it came down to was
that if we consider Olde Club
to be a student space, then it
is the student body's responsibility, collectively, to maintain it," Zalokostas said.

Zalokostas and Jargow said
that SBC has been an invaluable resource.
The SBC funded a cleaning
service for Olde Club at the
end of the fall semester. SBC
hired an outside company to
do the cleaning because of the
magnitude of the job.
Jargow said that SBC
recently granted funding for
another cleaning again this
next year. Jargow thinks that
this maintenance may turn
into an annual project.
Despite

A leak from a clogged toilet
has caused some water damage in the equipment storage
room of Olde Club. The toilet
overflowed just prior to winter break and continued to
leak until early January when
Maintenance discovered the
problem.

The water seeped through
the ceiling and caused some of
the ceiling to break apart and
fall on the equipment and
sound board, Zalokostas said.
Maintenance has been
stalled from addressing the
problem because equipment is
in the way, Maguire said. A
lot of the sound equipment is
old and should be replaced,
Zalokostas said.

ABC alum profiles successful life beyond adversity

John M. Bonhomme, 32, towers. "I'm a big guy," the 6-foot-tall,
self-made, young entrepreneur
from South Jamaica, Queens
said. Often dubbed "Shaq" after
Shaquille O'Neal, Bonhomme
strikes a calm yet imposing pres-

Behind a pair of glasses, his
large eyes suggest untold stories
and depths of experience. Before
turning 14, he had already gotten
shot and stabbed on the streets of
New York. At 32, he now owns
and runs a successful private
equity firm in Washington, D.C.
Bonhomme grew up in a low-

income, inner-city neighborhood
largely populated by AfroCaribbean immigrants. "My
friends wanted to hang out, play
sports and get in trouble," he

said. Two of his best childhood

dzingarl@swarthmore.edu

Corey Silberstein 'l2 took to the stage
at the Lang Concert Hall on Sunday,
March 28 for his sophomore piano recital.
Sporting a black tuxedo, Silberstein
grinned widely as he entered onto the
stage in front of an audience of family and
Mends. He took a seat at the grand piano
and the audience quieted down. He then
dove into a challenging repertoire.
The concert began with Bach's
Toccata in E minor BWV 914, and then
Chopin's Fantasie in F minor, Op. 49.
Following intermission, Silberstein performed Mozart's Sonata in B-flat K. 333

and then finished with Scriabin's Etudes
No. 1 and No. 5, Op. 42.
Students at Swarthmore are only
required to play a junior or senior recital.
Yet Silberstein chose to also perform a
sophomore recital after considering the
requirement for music conservatory students to hold a recital each year of schooling. "I figured why not do that myself
since I have things prepared and I want to

Silberstein said.

thatI really wanted to become a musician
and since then I've been very determined
to become a professional musician," he
said.
Silberstein later attended a performing arts high school, which "was like
being at a'music camp all year long." Yet,
he found that students were almost exclusively interested in the music that they
were playing. Silberstein, a music major
and prospective political science minor,
recognized that students lacked interest
in the history and theory behind the
music, as well as any focus in areas of
academics.
The broader study of music at
attracted
Silberstein.
Swarthmore
Professor Gerald Levinson, Silberstein's
music theory instructor, described
Silberstein as "a natural musician." He
considers the pianist someone who could
have easily considered attending a professional school of music, but notices
Silberstein recognized that "there was
more value at a liberal arts designation."
He explained that conservatories' spe-

cialization can be too narrowing as students there are conditioned to disregard
the inner workings of music.
"Here [at Swarthmore] there is an
intellectual curiosity about 'Wow, isn't
that cool. Look at how this works.' So,
there is an excitement about it, which
really feeds into real music making, not

just scholarship," Levinson said.

Neither of Silberstein's parents is
musical, but he does share his musical
interests with his brother who is a flutist
at Yale University. Ultimately, Silberstein
hopes to attend graduate school for music
and become a teacher as well as a soloist
and accompanist.
Silberstein's ideal practice regime is
three hours daily, a routine that he. has
had since he was thirteen years old. His
basic approach to a new piece includes
determining the piece's rhythm and how
the notes are organized.
"When we speak and we are saying
sentences to one another there are certain words that we emphasize because
they are the most important words in the
sentences. I kind of make sense of musical sentences," he said, adding that he can
then bring the music to life.
Silberstein impeccably executed each
note of his repertoire as his selections

drifted from the childlike and playful
world of Mozart to the intricate melodies
of Scriabin.
"You have to be a very fine pianist
technically and also very thoughtful and
attentive and intelligent to play this program," Levinson said.
Though the piece lacks intervals of
faster notes found in his other selections,
Silberstein explained that Mozart is actually the most challenging.
"Mozart is the composer that every
pianist loves and dreads to play. It is very
simple and child-like at times and it is so
exposed," Silberstein said. "If you make
the tiniest little mistake, it just sticks out
like a sore thumb to the audience."
Dr. James" Goldsworthy, Silberstein's
music professor, feels that students' performances are merely part of a "continuum in the learning process."
Of all four composers that he performed, Silberstein believes his own personality comes through the most in
Scriabin.
"His music is all about mysticism and
grandiose conceptions of the world and
these exalted human emotions," he said.
"This isn't my personality per se, but I
just find his music so rich and sensuous
and it's very colorful."

In 'Hot Tub,' a shockingly painless blast to the past

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY ISAAC HAN
ihanl@swarthmore.edu

When I heard that the title of the movie I'm about

to review was called "Hot Tub Time Machine" a few
weeks ago in a commercial on television, I remember
thinking to myself, "What a ridiculously dumb concept for a movie." Not only is it a movie about a time

stupid title. In a great scene, where the characters figure out that they have been transported to 1986 by the
hot tub, Nick cheekily says that the hot tub must be
some kind of hot tub time machine, and then looks out
at the audience. The movie is riddled with tongue-incheek references to bad movies about time machines

and time travel, of which, alas, there are so many.

Chatroulette taps into our voyeuristic curiosities
swarthmorephoenix.com

I should open this col-umn by saying that
Chatroulette absolutely terrifies me. As I'm sure you
all have heard by now,
Chatroulette is an online
chat interface in which the
user is randomly connected
with another user from
anywhere across the globe
by video and/or written
chat. If the user doesn't like
what he or she sees, one
Emily Crawford
can dismiss one's cosmic
Into the Abyss
connection with a simple
■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ click of the "next" button,
which will usher the next
available chatter onto his or her computer screen.
Unsurprisingly, Chatroulette is full of exposed foreign
penises, despite the "Please stay clothed" rule that
appears on the website's opening page. The nudity, for me,
is,the least scary part of Chatroulette. Far worse are the
strange behaviors one sees: men dressed up as animals,
gas-mask-clad faces, unintelligible commands given to do
strange or offensive things. Chatroulette has become society's great arena in which everyone can conduct their
own psychological experiment, but with no rules, no guiding ethics. This, of course, is all coming from the perspective of someone who has never played Chatroulette herself.
.Yes, I am a Chatroulette virgin, and for now I plan on
keeping myself quite chaste in that respect. Normally I am
all in favor of some healthy experimentation, but I draw
the line at making my real-time image and actions public
property to be viewed by anyone. Because Chatroulette
brings a publicity that is quite different than say, appearing on film or having one's picture in a newspaper. The
anonymous viewers on the website don't just get to see
your image, the way that celebrities' images are accessible

to strangers everywhere; they get to peer into your bed-

room or living room, see what you are doing exactly at
not an image of yourself that
that minute, how you look
you've prepared and previewed, but your immediate reality that changes every millisecond. This is a privilege that
I happily reserve for friends, family, acquaintances, even
random passersby but not strangers half the globe away.
-

Call me a prude, but I like to know that the extent to which
I can be observed is limited by physical space and notions
of privacy and when you sign on to Chatroulette, you are
absolutely throwing the notion of privacy out the door
This is not to say that I am condemning the use of
Chatroulette. Rather, I suppose this column is posing a
question to Chatroulette users: Why? Why is that fun for
you? Is it the thrill, the novelty, the voyeurism? Because
the phenomenon is, above all, a condoned method of
voyeurism. Users can peer into the lives of others, guiltfree, because those others knowingly signed up to do the
same. It is exactly because it is completely consensual that
hey, if
I can't really condemn Chatroulette altogether
you enjoy it, more power to you. But there is still something in the concept that I find unavoidably "icky," and it
has little to do with the prevalence of nudity on the site
(although I'm not dying to see a stranger's genitalia either,
to be honest).
Although I myself have never participated in
Chatroulette, many of my friends have. In fact, many of
my friends LOVE it. They sit huddled around the screen,
thinking of new things to do, such as "Let's convince them
that we're Puerto Rican!" or "Let's have a staring contest!"
Apparently, the thing is quite addictive. In fact, groups of
vaguely intoxicated college students are reportedly one of
the more common demographics found on the website,
right after genitalia and lonely old men. I'm guessing that
the fad's coverage by everyone from The New York Times
to Gawker might have something to do with its popularity
among the collegiate set.
I have come to the conclusion that it is precisely the
voyeuristic aspect ofChatroulette that makes it so appealing. It is basic human nature to want to peek through
holes in fences and listen at keyholes, but we are generally told not to indulge these curiosities. Chatroulette plays
into this by telling us its okay, that not only can we spy
and eavesdrop away with abandon, but we should feel free
to shuffle through human beings using the "next" button
whenever we get bored. To be fair, the website does offer
the equalizing knowledge that whoever you're voyeuristically watching can watch you right back, and interact
with you, but this doesn't make the root of the pleasure
one derives from it any less sinister. The amount of genitalia and requests for nudity on the site confirm this overtone of sexualized voyeurism that the site creates
apparently it is not uncommon to be connected with a

middle-aged man holding a sign that says "show me your
tits," who will promptly hit the "next" button if you are
either incompliant or male.
So I seem to have found the root of my fear of
Chatroulette: It is a fear not only of being observed by a
complete stranger, but a fear that I would enjoy doing the
same. The fact is that we, as human beings, all have some
level of voyeuristic desire
be it the desire to look at a
friend's phone when he or she leaves it in your room, or
the desire to be a total creeper and spy on your neighbor
while her or she is naked. I fear Chatroulette because I
fear what obscure or disturbing pleasure I might derive if
I indulge my own scop'ophilic desires. So next time that
you find your mouse hovering over that "next" button,
about to decide that your current chat buddy is not interesting enough, stop to think about what weird Freudian
desires they may be failing to fulfill in you. Not because
you should stop or feel guilty, but just because we could all
use a little more self-psychoanalysis in our lives.

behave as if they are the select few who are

cool enough to appreciate its irreverent
sense of humor (which is put to much better use on "South Park"), entertaining
characters (rip-offs of the much more loveable Simpsons) and cutaway gags (which
cover up the fact that the plotlines themselves are uninteresting).
As you can probably tell from the preceding paragraph, I don't find "Family

of course, they're making jokes about rape,

enjoy episodes focused on the dynamic duo
of Stewie and Brian, who led this season's
standout episode "Road to the Multiverse."
However, aside from these few bright

spots, "Family Guy" is usually nothing
more than a mediocre storyline filled with
supposedly sharp pop-culture gags that
could have been written by manatees playing with plastic balls. (If you understood
that last reference, you are clearly watching* the infinitely superior "South Park,"
and for that I salute you).
What I'm trying to say is that the real
star of the Seth McFarlane family isn't the
overrated "Family Guy," or the rather slow
and plodding "Cleveland Show." No, the

the story of CIA agent Stan Smith and his
family (which, besides his trophy wife, hippie daughter and geeky son, also includes
the always-funny Roger, an alien rescued
from Area 51, and Klaus, a German man in
the body of a fish). "American Dad!" is
funny and charming, with entertaining storylines, compelling characters and a slew
of killer throwaway lines, most of which

are uttered by Roger.
"American Dad!" is consistently funny
when dealing with normal (well, normal-

ish) family drama, such as the episode
when Stan's son Steve takes steroids in
order to become athletic and to please his

father, and instead ends up with breasts.
Or the episode when it turns out that
Roger, in disguise, was a member of the
1984 "Miracle on Ice" hockey team, and
Stan's quest to return his alien friend's
undeserved medal to the International
Olympic Committee turns into the Lord of
the Rings-style quest. (Like I said, normalish.) However, the show is truly inspired
when the writers delve into truly fantastical storylines that destroy any chance the
show had at continuity (not to mention
often defying the laws of physics). As evidence, I point you to this year's Christmas
episode, titled "Rapture's Delight."
The episode focuses on the Rapture
not altogether surprising, given the title
the moment, foretold in the book of
Revelation, in which God summons the
souls of the devout up to Heaven, while
leaving the sinners on Earth to fight off the
Antichrist and his apocalyptic armies for
seven years. (For those of you who follow
the world of apocalyptic Christian fiction,
the seven years of hell on earth are the
basis of the bestselling "Left Behind" book
series.) This may seem like a strange topic
for a half-hour animated show to tackle,
but "American Dad!" pulls it off beautifully; the story is at once funny and profound,
showing both the depths of Stan's
hypocrisy and his eventual redemption in
a starkly unsentimental way.
This isn't to say that the episode isn't
funny, because it is. Great sight gags and

throwaway lines abound, as do jokes about
religious fanatics, false prophets and Las
Vegas. For me, there are a few standout
moments: Jesus (clean-shaven and oddly
hot) walking across the Smith's backyard
pool; the discovery that, for the seven years
of hell on earth, Roger has made his home
in an abandoned Anthropologic; and a
great (and slightly unsettling) sight gag in
which Stan shoots a schoolboy who looks
like Damien from "The Omen" in the face,
believing him to be the Antichrist.
Now, "Family Guy" fanatics will probably say that "Rapture's Delight" is nothing
more than a rehash of "Da Boom," a second-season episode in which the Griffin
family goes on a quest to find a Twinkie
factory after the Y2K apocalypse. However,
"Rapture's Delight," with its sharp skewering of religious fanaticism and hypocrisy,
bears more resemblance to the classic
"South Park" episode "A Woodland Critter

Christmas," but with more heart and fewer
cursing children. For all that. "Family
Guy" attempts to be as edgy as "South
Park," it is the smaller, smarter "American
Dad!" that has the potential to, in time, be
as edgy in its own way as that groundbreaking series. So "Family Guy" fans,
remember: there's a new cult in town, and
it's smarter, funnier and edgier than yours.
I think that even Stewie would agree with

me.

SEPTA policing gender, drag show held in protest

Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority, or SEPTA, is not
known for its modernity or outstanding customer relations, but a recent protest on
Tuesday has called special attention to the
company's discriminatory treatment of
transgender and queer persons. On the
monthly SEPTA transportation passes
known as "transpasses" or "trailpasses,"
the company places stickers with the letter
"M" or the letter "F" to indicate the gender
of the cardholder. This policy, a weak
attempt to reduce prohibited sharing of
passes, unfairly forces transgender and gender-non-conforming riders to identify as
either male or female. It also compels
SEPTA conductors to act as "gender police"
as they are responsible for judging whether
or not cardholders' gender matches the category indicated on their pass, resulting in
many a situation in which a rider whose
gender is misperceived by the conductor
may be denied the card discount if not
denied access to SEPTA transportation
entirely.
With these objections in mind, a group of
transgender activists known as Riders
Against Gender Discrimination, or RAGE,
Suburban
in
gathered
Station in
Philadelphia during afternoon rush hour on
Tuesday to hold a drag show in protest of
the policy. The protest was not the first of
efforts to pressure SEPTA to change the
gender sticker policy.
In fact, the problems with SEPTA's "gender sticker" policy first became a public
issue in 2007. A Philadelphia transit rider
named Charlene Arcila was prevented from
using her transportation pass when a
SEPTA bus driver claimed that her gender
identity didn't match that indicated by the
sticker. As a result, she did not receive the
discount associated with the transportation
pass and was required to pay full fare.
According to a June 2009 article in
Philadelphia Weekly newspaper, "Equality
Advocates Pennsylvania, the state's largest
LGBT civil rights organization, filed a complaint against SEPTA on Arcila's behalf."
Still, despite continued protests and a prothe

for its ineffectiveness as a policy. The

to

Philadelphia Weekly newspaper reports
that SEPTA argues it uses the stickers "to
cut down on illegally shared passes." Yet the
transpass includes no personal information
beyond the gender sticker, not even the
holder's name or date of birth. Other transportation systems, such as New York's
Metropolitan Transportation Authority and
Boston's Massachusetts Bay Transportation

Authority use passes that do not carry any
of the holder's personal information.
Also, it should be noted that merely verifying the gender of passholders does not

confirm that the holder of the pass is also its
owner. As gender verification is the only
check (assuming that SEPTA conductors
accurately identify the gender of the rider),
all passengers have to do to use another's
pass is to borrow it from a person of the
same gender. We believe that it is unnecessary to place any personal information at
all on the monthly passes. If SEPTA insists,
however, that it needs verification policies
that combat illegal sharing, it must alter the
passes to include virtually unique information such as the passenger's full name.
SEPTA Citizen Advisory Committee
member Robert Clearfield has asked SEPTA
riders to be patient in anticipation of a
move to an electronic card system that will
obviate the gender stickers. No such move
appears imminent, however, and the company's slow and almost nonexistent
response shows a lack of concern from the

In response to the aforementioned
protests from transgender and queer
activist communities, SEPTA said in
October that a new planned fare system will
not include any type of gender verification,
according to an article in the Philadelphia
Daily News yesterday. The implementation
of a new system has been delayed due to
funding problems. According to the article,
"In the meantime, SEPTA has no plans to
remove the stickers from the current passes." In a recent press release announcing
RAGE's drag show demonstration on
Tuesday, one RAGE member said, "They

that made
the 2009-2010 budget smaller than the 20082009 budget. Each round of cuts made up
part of an "eight million dollar plan," sonamed because of the need for $8 million in
annual reductions from the 2008-2009 budget. In this week's column, we'll be exploring just where both rounds of cuts fell and
what they mean for next year's students.
The two largest pieces of the first eight
million dollar plan were deliberately temporary three-year shifts which could not
responsibly be sustained indefinitely, but
provide significant cushion for the time
being. First, the facilities capital budget,
which funds building, renovation and
major maintenance projects was reduced
by $5,772,000 from $9 miUion in 2008-2009.
Because the college has been generally
proactive in maintaining facilities, this
sharp reduction can be made for a few
years without significant consequences.
However, after the specified three-year
period, spending will need to be increased.
Second, Swarthmore is spending significantly out of its reserves. For the 2009-2010
budget year and the next two years, the college will spend three-quarters of a million
dollars per year out of its general reserves,
such that endowment spending Xwhich, as
we have seen, must be cut) can be reduced
without reducing services. A separate technology reserve fund will provide $700,000
total over three years to fund technology
purchases. This spending, obviously, cannot be maintained indefinitely
the
reserves, estimated to remain at the fiscally responsible level of about $2 million
after this spending, are not infinite and
will run out.
The first eight million dollar plan also
included three major kinds of sustainable
changes. First, Swarthmore plans to slightly increase enrollment by about 35 students (to a target of 1420 students on campus per year) over three years. The college
believes that, given current facilities and
services, this number of students can be
added without significant increase in costs.
The 2009-2010 portion of this increase, a
planned 16 students, was expected to net an
additional $519,000 in revenue after financial aid for the year.

Second, a salary freeze was instituted
for the 2009-2010 budget year for faculty,
staff and students, leaving salaries the
same as in the 2008-2009 budget year.
According to treasurer SUe Welsh, this
freeze is permanent in the sense that, while
there will be some raises in the 2010-2011
budget, the college will not go back and
retroactively give raises for the 2009-2010
school year and percentage increases will
occur from the freeze-level base line. The
freeze was expected to save about $ll9 million, given that without the freeze there
would have been a two percent increase.
Third, the various departments of the
college saw their budgets reduced by about

$lBl5 million for this year, reductions of
which about $1441 were sustainable as
long-term cuts. What, exactly, did this

16

Total cuts for spring 2009 and fall 2009

mean? Among other things, a number of
print publications were cut or turned into
much less expensive electronic versions. In
the administrative and dean's offices, trav-

el, professional development, catering and
refreshments for meetings and events,
office supplies, facilities equipment purchases and outside contracts were all
reduced, in addition to attrition of an open
position, converting the student payroll
system, reducing the spring
fling
(Worthstock) budget, postponement of
some services and some changes to benefits. All together, these reductions were
expected to save about $1.26 million for the

2009-2010 budget year.
On the various departments under the
control of the provost, various cuts were
also made. The academic departments
faced a LI percent ($373,654) reduction for
the 2009-2010 budget year. These cuts were
made by cutting spending on speakers,
entertainment, materials, equipment purchases and visiting committees, as well as
reducing leave replacements and not filling an open tenure-track position. The
libraries and ITS received L 8 percent
($99,000) and 2.5 percent ($120,000) reductions, respectively. Athletics faced a 19 percent ($62,000) cut reducing the number of
assistant coaches, equipment replacement
and travel for teams.
Next budget year will see the beginning
of phase two of the planned changes in
spending, which will be added to the
changes made in last year's phase one.
Admissions and financial aid will face a
four percent ($143,711) cumulative cut,
through savings on student wages, publications, advertising, travel and professional
services, among other areas. The Dean's
Office will face a 4.8 percent ($222,194)
annual reduction through reducing student positions, training, programs, staff
development and student activities (like
conference funding and travel for Penn
classes). The Finance and President's
Offices will face six percent ($159,226) and
7.6 percent ($153,083) cumulative annual
reductions, respectively, by changing the
insurance program and reducing other
spending. Communications and Human
Resources will face 8.9 percent ($124,603),
and 9.3 percent ($120,520) annual cumulative cuts, respectively, through reducing
all operating budgets and compensation
savings, among other cuts. Facilities and
Services will bear a Significant portion of
the burden, at 7.3 percent ($1193,416),.
through reducing repairs, utilities, compensation (through attrition and turnover)
and other cuts.
For three of the four categories under
the Provost's umbrella, reductions will
also continue. The libraries will see an
additional $92,566 annual cut, for a cumulative 3.5 percent ($191,566) annual reduction; athletics will see an additional $41,235
cut for a cumulative 31 percent ($103,235)
cut. Academic departments, including the
Provost's Office proper, will face a cumulative $1132,942 (3.3 percent) cut, including
possible reductions in faculty salary
increases and the ending of some faculty
positions through attrition. ITS alone will
face no additional cuts, remaining at the
2.5 percent reduction from phase one.
Phase two will also introduce some new
cuts and changes. Benefits will be reduced
2.3 percent ($400,000) through "restructuring of health plans and modest reductions
in tuition benefits for employee children,"
according to the Ad H_oc Financial
Planning Group's December 2009 report.
Executive compensation will be reduced
5.7 percent ($175,000). Facilities capital projects, based on the college's current analysis of needs, will face a 26.7 percent ($2.5

rest of the game, scoring two goals and giving up two,
and handed the Garnet their third straight Centennial
Conference loss. The Diplomats scored five of their nine
goals during hard end-of-period play in the second and
third periods.
When asked how the Garnet can work on preventing
consecutive goals scored by the opposing team, Coach
Pat Gress said that his team is working on ball control
and winning more face-offs. The Garnet won only three
of the 19 face-offs and picked up 17 ground balls while the
Diplomats picked up 33. Also, F&M outshot Swarthmore
in each of the four periods.
Attacker Zach Belden 'l2, who added a goal of his own
in the fourth period against F&M, said that his team
needs to stay more disciplined all around, especially on
offense. "The defense has done a great job keeping us in
games, but a lot of the time we will turn the ball over on
a clear, or when running a play, which is obviously really frustrating." To improve on offense, Belden, along
with Gress, agreed that ball control is a significant factor. "If we hold the ball longer on offense, we'll score
more goals and when the other team gets the ball, they
will be more rushed to make a play and will hopefully
turn it over. Essentially, it's a downward spiral effect."
In the second game against Muhlenberg, played in
Allentown, PA, the Mules took an early 3-0 lead in the
first period. The Garnet did not give up, and fired 12
shots in the second period. Belden hit the back of the net
with a shot with 6:30 remaining in the second period to
make the score 4-2. He connected again at the beginning
of the third period, and executed his second goal nicely.
"Tyler made a move toward the goal, and when the dou-

Now about halfway through the season, the Garnet
men's lacrosse team has had its fair share of close losses.
The team has lost three of its last four games by only one
point, with one game going into overtime.
After dropping two more games this past week the
first in a 9-7 loss to the Franklin & Marshall Diplomats
(3-4,1-2 CC) on Wednesday, March 24 and the second in a
9-8 loss to the Muhlenberg Mules (4-3, 3-1 CC) on
Saturday, March 30
the Garnet find themselves defeated in the Centennial Conference with a 0-4 record.
Overall, the Garnet are 1-6 on the season, their first victory against Eastern College being the only one so far.
The home game versus Franklin & Marshall featured
a lot of back-and-forth scoring. Captain Gavin Musynske
'lO opened the game strongly for the Garnet, scoring a
quick unassisted goal and then adding an assist to fellow
captain attacker Tyler Bradshaw 'lO. The Garnet took
advantage of slashing penalties committed by F&M early
in the game with both of their goals coming off of extra
man opportunities. With the score tied going into the
second period, Bradshaw connected for a second goal,
making the score 3-2. However, in the last five minutes
before halftime, the Diplomats took back the lead by
scoring three consecutive goals to end the second period.
Bradshaw, who had a season high in goals for the
game, hit the back of the net two more times to close the
Diplomat's lead. With the third period winding down
and the game tied at five goals apiece, F&M answered
with two more goals. They maintained the lead for the

ble came he dished it to me behind the cage. I saw I had
some space to dodge, so I split to the inside of my defender, and just popped the ball into the far corner of the net,"
Belden said of his goal. Two more goals for the Garnet
scored by Musynske and Max Hubbard 'l2 moved the
game to tied at five. But the Garnet could not take the
lead for the rest of the game. With Swarthmore and
Muhlenberg exchanging goals throughout the fourth
period, the game ended in a close 9-8 loss for the Garnet.
Wes Marcik 13, Hubbard, and Bradshaw each added a
goal in the fourth period.
Though the Garnet lost the game, they did a better job
winning face-offs, with Mark Czernyk 'll winning 10 of
the 19. Belden said, "As for the Muhlenberg game in particular, Mark did a great job on the face-offs, which made
a big difference."
As usual, captain Kevin Friedenberg 10 also performed exceptionally for the Garnet, racking up 28 more
saves over the two games. The Senior All-American candidate finished with 15 saves against Franklin &
Marshall and 13 saves against Muhlenberg.
Gress said that mistakes have certainly played a
major role in the team's recent losses. He also said that
although the attack unit played well in both games, there
remains room for improvement. "Running the offense
with more patience and until we get a quality shot will
be an area that we will we focus on."
Bradshaw said that the Garnet can improve in two
ways: "We stop getting scored on and we score more
goals."

The Garnet will face off in an away game against
McDaniel College on April 31 Game time is set for 3 p.m.

Miller was given a shirt that was signed by

when you are swimming at a meet by yourself, to know in the back of your mind that

because the existence of the Snitch in
the sport leaves so much to luck and
essentially transforms each match into a
game of craps.
Furthermore, instead of focusing on
facets of Quidditch such as effective
offensive formations (the Hawkshead
Attacking Formation came about before
the Snitch was introduced) or practicing
proper form in using the Bludgers, the
significance of the Snitch ultimately
forces teams to focus game plans around
its capture.
This not only reduces the strategic
depth of matches, but also increases the
danger to Seekers; as the Snitch's capture becomes more and more integral to
winning, Beaters will aim Bludgers
more and more at Seekers. Though fatalities in the sport are rare, the tragic
death of the Chudley Cannon's star seeker Emma Radcliffe by a legal point blank
Bludger hit last season shows that
deaths are possible.
It surprises me that Quidditch fans
and members of the Department of
Magical Games and Sports of the
Ministry of Magic haven't satisfactorily
engendered talks questioning the function of the Golden Snitch in the current
landscape of the sport. Given the circumstances and arguments I have laid
out, it would only seem logical for
Quidditch leagues to drop the Golden
Snitch completely from the game. Like
the evolution of magic from the time of
Nostradamus to the present, it's time for
the sport to evolve to match the new
environment.

one full year ago on April 4, 2009, when
they defeated Bryn Mawr. Over the past
three seasons, the Garnet have posted a 317 record against conference opponents.
Midfielder Beth Martin 13 partially
attributed the defeat to a lapse in the
team's aggressive mindset.
"When we played games earlier in the
season, we always came out with the attitude of Wre going to beat them' and
[Saturday] the feeling was more 'well,
this is the number-two [Division lII] team
in the country," Martin said. "We felt better about the second half, but we didn't
come with the confidence we needed to
stick with a team like Gettysburg."
"The feeling [after the game] was, 'I
wish we could do that over again,'"

'

spent nearly the
entire 60 minutes
under constant pressure, but managed to
save five goals. Gettysburg opted for a

platoon in front of the net, as Kristin
Krammer and Laura Mclntyre recorded
a save apiece.
Grein said that while her team played
hard against Gettysburg and put up a
good fight, they definitely could have
played better. "There were moments
when we were playing on Gettysburg's
level and staying with them, playing
great defense and making good passes,
and then there were moments where we
broke down

in transition or made bad
decisions which lead to turnovers."
Grein believes that the game highlighted
ways in which the Garnet could improve
their level of play. "To take our play to
the next level, we have to be more consistent in controlling the draw more frequently, winning the ground balls, and
playing smart defense. This is something
we have been working on and I think it
will translate to success in our future
games."

For the Garnet, the defeat marks the

seventh consecutive loss to a conference
opponent dating back to last season.
Their last victory in the ultra-competi-

tive Centennial conference came

nearly

"You
learn
more from a
like
game
Saturday, where
you were tested,

playing a really
good team like

that, than from
easily beating a
team like we'd
done in the last
few games before

[Saturday]," Martin said.
"Coach [Karen Borbee] told us, 'lf you
don't learn from this game, then it's a
waste of a trip.' Individually every person learned something, and she said, "we
didn't come out with the right confidence
and the attitude that we're going to give
[Gettysburg] a run for their money,'"
Martin said.
Phoebe Hansen 'l2, a midfielder, said
that she doesn't think the score was
indicative of the Garnet's skill versus
Gettysburg's. She agreed with Martin
that her team could have played better
mentally. "I think most all of our mistakes were mental; Gettysburg is a pretty
good team and it got to us mentally We
should have been able to keep up with
them better, but unfortunately we had a
mental block and we let them control the
game. Hopefully, we can learn from this
experience, and if there's anything to
take away from it, it's that a lot of the
game is mental and in your attitude."
Hansen acknowledged that her team
needs to move forward from the loss.
The Garnet get a break from conference play tonight when they take on
Wesley at home. Game time is slated for 7
p.m.
