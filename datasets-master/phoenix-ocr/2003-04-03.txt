New hall approved
The Housing Committee voted this week to adopt yet another
themed hall for the 2003-2004 academic year. Parrish Fourth
West and East, two single-sex halls, have been selected as the
masturbation-free halls. Students living on these halls will be
expected to pursue a masturbation-free lifestyle.
"We feel that a masturbation-free hall will increase the openness of social life and friendships in the dorm," Director of
Residential Life Myrt Westphal explained. "Students won't be
able to hide their actions behind closed doors."
Dean of the CoUege Bob Gross '62 also supported the idea. "I
mean, dun," he said.
"We thought it would be a hoot if a bunch of guys could actuwell, you know,"
ally make it the whole year without
Westphal said. "As for the girls, we had to be equal opportunity
...

deniers."

A survey that members of Housing Committee created before
writing their proposal for masturbation-free housing revealed
that 32 percent of the campus would approve of a masturbationfree lifestyle hall. While approximately 500 students responded to
the survey, surprisingly enough, zero of them said that they
would be willing to live in a masturbation-free dorm.
Furthermore, with nine beds on the men's side and 14 on the
women's side reserved for first-years, the roommate surveys
mailed out in April now include questions about students' pleasuring habits.
"Although knowing the habits of their roommates may make
some students uncomfortable, at least they know they have a
comrade in arms," Gross said.
The halls' resident assitants will be expected to take a handson approach to enforcing the rules of the hall. Gross explained
the enforcement policy. "You just give everyone a pair of boxing
gloves and say, 'There you go, slugger. Good night.'

Swarthmore acquires Skidmore
Citing problems with "brand confusion," Swarthmore finalized its hostile
takeover bid for Skidmore College of
Saratoga Springs, New York, last Friday.
Though some raised concerns that
the move would associate Swarthmore
with aggressive business practices, nonconsensus-based dissolution of rival
schools, and the state of New York,
President Al Bloom remained optimistic.
Swarthmore College announced
plans to dismiss Skidmore students and
staff, effective immediately, and to
reduce Skidmore faculty from the status
of college professors to low-wage maintenance staff at Swarthmore.
Bloom said the existence of Skidmore
had created the misconception that
Swarthmore was an all-girls' school,
which was unfair to Swarthmore
women. Upon being told that Skidmore
was, in fact, a coeducational institution,

he insisted his point still stood.
The now vacant Skidmore campus
will be used to provide extra parking
space for Sharpies staff on their daily
commute and to house the long-awaited
state-of-the-art interpretation theory laboratory.
Bloom would not comment on rumors

of an underground "Bombing of
Swarthmore Campaign" developing
among the bitter and dispossessed resi-

dents of the occupied Skidmore territories.

Current and prospective Swarthmore
students gathered excitedly at an
impromptu coUection to hear Al Bloom's
account of his heroic exploits during the
takeover at a fireside chat lit by the flickering radiance of hundreds of burning
copies of the Skidmore Honor Code.
Arthur Chu 'O6 responded, "This new
'Burning of Skidmore Campaign' was

obviously centered around oil interests."

No one likes girl at end of hall
Students congregating in the first-floor lounge of

next to the bathroom said. "But she's actually kind of a

College vice president Larry Schall '75 has returned from a
visit to Antarctica, where the college had sent him to purchase
ice for Sharpies soda machines. Amundsen-Scott Station, a small
government-owned research base located at the South Pole, will
now supply ice for students' cold beverages.
"They were set up to chip it the way we wanted, and so it
was a lot cheaper," Schall said. He could not say how the price
would compare to an equivalent amount of cubed ice. "We
never priced the beverage machine for cubed ice," he said.
The trip the southern hemisphere was a normal part of ice
selection, Schall said. "Maybe seven or eight years ago, we
went to a pig slaughterhouse to buy footballs," he recalled.
Schall described his days in Antarctica in a comprehensive
memo that included photos and souvenirs, describing how the
team had sampled chilled cocktails to test the quality of the ice.

Other students remembered a Friday night when the
girl had told them to lower their music. "I mean, it was
eleven o'clock on a Friday. That's completely uncalled
for," a sophomore said.
The students discussed the possibility of playing a
prank on the girl at the end of the hall, but the discussion was interrupted when their pizza arrived.

INS registers
students
BY JULIA POMPETTI
jpompetl@swarthmore.edu

Under the new National Security Entry-Exit
Registration System, the Department of Justice now
requires male immigrants with visas From 25 almost
exclusively Muslim countries to participate in a special call-in registration. The system was "designed to
improve protection for U.S. citizens from possible
terrorist threats," according to the U.S. Department
of State.

Youssef Soliman 'O3, an economics major and
Egyptian citizen in the United States on a student
visa, had to register with the fourth group of countries.

The first group called for male immigrants from
Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan and Syria. Three additional
groups of countries, designated as "an elevated
national security risk" by the state department, were
later added. The fourth group comprised countries
that receive monetary aid from the government,
including Kuwait and Jordan, which Soliman
described as generally pro-American.
Soliman said he had received a letter in English
and Arabic asking him to register with the INS. "I
was a little apprehensive, but I think I just had to do
it. I knew it was going to be time-consuming," he
said.
Last week, he went down to the Bureau of
Citizenship and Immigration in Philadelphia and,
after passing through general security, was asked to
fill out a questionnaire and produce his passport.
The questionnaire asked for eye color, weight and
height, along with the purpose of his stay in the U.S.
After waiting about 30 minutes in a room with
plenty of reading material but few other people,
which he speculated was because he had waited until
the end of the registration period to go in, he was
ushered into a cubicle.
There, Soliman said, an official "punched some
numbers into a computer" took his fingerprints and
his photograph, and "the computer spat out a number
which he wrote on my 1-90 form, visa and passport."
Soliman was then informed that if he wanted to
travel he would have to leave the country through
certain ports. Though he was planning on staying in
the country and getting his Optional Training Card,
one of the acceptable ports was conveniently in
Philadelphia. He was also told to arrive at the airport
five hours early because he would need to go for
another interview with the INS.

Due to the creation of the multicultural education
hall in Mertz Hall, there will be no sophomore blocks
available, according to Myrt Westphal, dean of residential life.
Because first-years will not live in the multicultural education hall, Westphal said, the rooms for
first-years normally located on that hall will occupy
the

three current two-room sophomore blocks

instead.
If the multicultural education housing does not
fill up, the rooms will return to the housing lottery. A
sign-up sheet for the Mertz multicultural education
hall and Woolman, next year's substance-free dorm,
went up yesterday on the first floor of Parrish. At
press time, no one had signed up.
Applications for the two theme halls and other
blocks throughout the campus are due April 10.

Admissions changes program
Students will "Ride the Tide to Swat"
from Wednesday to Friday this year
BY SUE CHEN

schenl@swarthmore.edu

Admitted students will not visit
Swarthmore on a weekend this year. The
prospective student event, "Ride the Tide
to Swat," will take place on the weekdays of
April 23-25. There will also be no minority
prospective students' day.
According to the admissions staff, these
changes are due to calendar constraints.
Typically, high school seniors come to
prospective students' weekend about two
weeks after they receive their acceptance
letters around April L This year, Passover
and Easter fall on that weekend, and the
admissions office is reluctant to ask students to spend religious holidays away
from their families.
On the next weekend, many of
Swarthmore's competitor schools hold
their admitted student weekends.

of doing it during the week is they'll be able
to really see what Swatties are like, because,
believe it or not, they want it. Admitted students are attracted to Swarthmore because
of the academic intensity and because of
social opportunities, as well," Nam said.
Pub Nite will still take place, according
to Nam, who did not believe it would be a
big problem given the number of activities
available for both hosts and prospective

students.

The admissions office, which pays for

transportation for some minority students,
will see costs rise this year. Prospective
students' days will run from Wednesday to
Friday, and airplane tickets will be more
expensive because there will be no
Saturday stay-over.

Minority students' day canceled
The admissions office has decided not to
hold a separate day for prospective minori-

"We didn't want the students to have to

ty students before the rest of the students

choose between us and them, especially
since the students that are admitted to
Swarthmore have a good deal of options,"
said admissions counselor Suzi Nam, who
is in charge of planning the admitted students' program this year.
Associate dean of admissions Tevera
Stith said that Swarthmore does not want

come. According to Nam, the decision may
only apply to this year and is a result of the

to overlap with other schools, "not because
we think we hold a second fiddle to them,
but why compete against five other schools

for one weekend?"
No one knows if the change to weekdays
will be permanent. Nam said the office
would evaluate the change through surveys for admitted students and through
yield rates, the percentage of students who
decide to attend Swarthmore.
Nam also said she did not think it would
be a problem for
prospective students
to come during the

especially for those who were preparing for

"It was really important for us to make
sure that we accommodated as many students as possible," Stith, who is also coordinator for recruitment of students of
color, said.
Stith added that, in the past, most cultural programming did not take place on
minority prospective students' day. She
said that all the extra day had provided
was a chance for some students to come
early and attend a pizza party orientation.
While Stith said it was important for
minority students to

Since Swarthmore

it was also important

"Swatties

Furthermore, prospective minority students would have already looked at admissions statistics and would know that
Swarthmore has a multicultural population, Stith said.

Benjamin Kabak Phoenix Staff

Admissions office staff pored over almost 4,000 applications this year before making their
decisions. Members of the admitted class will be visiting campus over the next few weeks,
,
and the college has planned changes to the usual programming.
Current students who attended minority prospective students' day said that the
extra day had not seemed all that different.
What they enjoyed most was the chance to
stay over at the college an extra day, they
said.
There will still be multicultural events

during prospective students' days, and
minority students will have a different
schedule that

will include cultural open
houses.
Some multicultural groups were surprised that there would be no separate day
for minority students.
"We were a little shocked. We were
accustomed to minority pre-frosh. That's
what we all came to," admissions student
of color intern Michelle Lo 'O4 said.
However, Lo said she understood the

scheduling problem the admissions office

faces, and she added that the admissions
office was still doing a lot of minority student outreach, such as Project SMART
(Swarthmore Multicultural Admissions
Recruitment Team), which engages current
Swarthmore minority students to reach
out to prospective minorities on a one-on-

one basis.
There was some concern that minority
students would have to choose between
which events to attend.
"It now means that we might be pitted
against other 'mainstream' events," said
Becky Monarrez 'O5, co-president of the
Hispanic student group Enlace. The whole
point of minority prospective students'
day, she said, was to allow minority students to see the minority community at
Swarthmore and the resources available to
them "without feeling that they will be
missing out on other events sponsored by
the college."
Some Swarthmore students were also
worried that hosting would be difficult

during the week.
"Obviously, there's a concern of how
much time students will be able to give to
the high school students they're hosting,"
admissions hosting intern Sam Berger 'O5

said.

But Nam said that the activities planned
for the weekdays would take up most of

prospective students' time, including a
trolley tour on Wednesday night.

Dorms get designated days for
hosting prospective students
Beginning April % the admissions hosting program will implement a new
overnight program in which prospective students all stay in the same dorm, according to admissions hosting interns Jake Berger 'O5 and Sam Berger 'O5.
Students living in Mertz, Parrish, Wharton and Willets will each have a specific
weekday for which they can sign up to host prospective students. A miscellaneous
day has been designated for those living in Palmer, Pittenger and Roberts and Mary
Lyon.
This new program will encourage prospective students to meet each other and
allow Public Safety to find them more easily, both of which were the reasons behind
the change, according to Berger and Berger.

approach it," she said. Wilson
said that, in response, she developed a class to focus on analyzing
forms of social injustice and the
ways in which society perpetuates them. The basis of the curriculum originated from work by
the
Graduate
School
for
Education at UMass Amherst,
which has a distinct curriculum
for teaching social justice education.
Wilson said she had structured
the class to spend each week analyzing one form of social injustice. "Basically, each class we
look at an 'ism,' such as racism,
sexism, classism, ageism and reli-

"We also look at the frameworks

for understanding these forms of

One of the highlights of the
class, Wilson said, was a visit
from Maurianne Adams '59, a professor involved in social justice
education at UMass Amherst,
who taught a lesson on antiSemitism.

black issues are only dealt with
from the standpoint of the victimoppressor dichotomy. The ideology of Pan-Africanism is that
blacks are agents of history, not
just victims," he said.

Taylor said that the Great

who set the agenda for PanAfricanism speak for themselves," Taylor said. "We interpret the primary sources for ourselves, cutting out the role of the
professor as middleman. Instead,
the authors are our professors,"
he said.

classes because they need to fulfill PDC and major requirements,
so it's difficult for a lot of students

to fit them in," Wilson said.
Taylor said he felt the need to
"inspire the student sometimes,
because the students are taking
this pass/fail. They are not motivated by grades or fulfilling
requirements. Instead, there is
only learning for its own sake."
Wulfsberg agreed that "students
can take the class less seriously.
They may not devote as much

the difficulties in organizing stu-

dent-taught classes. "It takes a lot
to say that I have something
worth teaching; it's difficult. But
there are things that need to be
taught that aren't in the course
book," Wilson said.
"I feel like students should
take more initiative," Taylor said.
"There are a lot of gaps and holes
in the offered curriculum for students to fill."
Wilson said she thought she
would "get more out of this than
the students," from the experience
of planning lessons and leading

said of the experience, elaborating, "if I'm
here, I have to play by your rules. I think
they have to do it for security reasons."
Saed Atshan 'O6, a student from
Palestine who is also studying here on a
student visa, did not have to register with
the INS because "there is no official country called Palestine, so they can't call on
everyone from Palestine." Instead, they
just avoided the possible ambiguities,
Atshan said.

Atshan does have friends and relatives
who have had to register. He described the
questions they were asked as "really dehumanizing and culturally insensitive,"
including "Do you have the potential of
becoming an Islamic extremist?"

Atshan feels the registration unfairly
targets Arabs and Muslims and propagates
fear and prejudice. "A lot of my classmates
came to the U.S. to study here, and, with
this hysteria, they just couldn't tolerate it
anymore and transferred to colleges in
other countries," he said. "I've been lucky
that I go to Swarthmore."
Organizations such as the American
Civil Liberties Union and Amnesty
International have also voiced their concerns about the new system. A Reuters arti-

cle and Amnesty International reported
that hundreds of men in the first group of
countries were arrested when they went to
register in southern California. Amnesty
took issue with the treatment of those
arrested, who stated they were being
"denied food and necessary medicines and
access to lawyers, forced to sleep standing
up on concrete floors, in freezing condi-

tions with no blankets, subject to strip
searches and hosed down with cold water,

shuttled between states in prison buses

shackled and in handcuffs looking for free
cells."

"If I'm here, I have to play
by your rules."
Youssef Soliman 'O3
Amnesty International maintains that

it "does not dispute the requirement of
immigrants on temporary visas to be
tracked and registered. However, if people

are being detained or singled out for harsh
treatment solely on grounds of their
nationality or gender, this would appear to

April 3, 2003

breach international standards prohibiting
discrimination." The report elaborated
that "most of the detainees were held for
minor visa violations, including expired
visas or failing to provide adequate documentation; many reportedly had pending
applications for extensions, or had nearly
completed the process for legal residency.
There were also reports that people
believed to be in compliance with immi-

gration regulations were also detained."
Regarding the current environment for
Arab people in the United States, Atshan
responded that "it's hard, but I'm not going
to let that discourage me."
He said he was disappointed with the
situation, which has resulted in it being
"virtually impossible to get your visa
renewed. A lot of colleges have already
experienced a decline in Arab and Muslim
students."

Claremont, Calif., and
their effect on his view of
campus diversity. In contrast to that campus environment, where diversity
was natural and appreciated, he found that people in
the Northeast "resisted the
idea." Bloom said that, as
president, his goal has
been to "make Swarthmore
as diverse as possible."
"This campus should
look like the world,"
Bloom said. "It's a very

Bloom also addressed
questions on other issues.
Describing his feelings on

said, "With 15 percent slots

tural housing, Bloom said,
"I'm telling conservatives,

and it won't."
He acknowledged the
difficulties people with
minority political opinions
have on campus but said,
"We all have the same
goals. We're all so similar.
If people here really talk
and get to know each other
beyond their differences,
we find out our differences
are so minor, differences of
method. But 90 percent is

Bloom concluded by discussing plans for the
future, stressing that his
goal was to get Swarthmore
students to focus on the college's mission, "Becoming
leaders and leading others
to become leaders of a more
just and compassionate
world." He plans to
expound on these points at

think I do it with indecisive
gusto that has its own worth, if only in comedic value.
Imagine my consternation, then, sitting in the Robot

Lab, where all the cool kids hang out, checking the tri-co
course schedule online, as all the cool kids do. A senior
friend of mine, next to me creating his business card, says
this: "It is pre-registration time? Oh, my stars and garters.
I do not have to do that, because I wiU not be here." This is
not an exact quote; he actually said "Jumpin' Jiminy!"
rather than "Oh, my stars and garters." But the point was
clear; one might even say too clear. Allow me the use ofall
caps: SWARTHMORE ENDS. There wiU be no "next
semester" for one quarter of our student population.
They, at least those not already accepted into graduate
school and the continuance of their existence-quaacademicians, will proceed, onward and outward, to
"real life," such as it is, and whatever that means.
It feels like one of those public health

www.myfuture.edu.au: nanny, netballer, non-destructive
testing technician, nun, oenologist, open-cut miner, operator (kiln), panel beater, phlebotomist and pig farmer.
Not that kiln operation, or most of these jobs really,
isn't pretty sweet, but one can't help but note the utter lack
of "ninja," "pirate" or "rock star," which would be misspelled ("pock star"?) if it were in one of these sections, but
that's not the point. The fact is that there is much more
call for panel beaters and netballers in the world, especially in Australia, than there is for pirates. Thus, inadvertently, the 10-year-old me will probably be let down. This is
an ongoing process of life that started the day I realized I
didn't have time to both be a dinosaur scientist and a
superhero. This is why the future is twitch-inducing;
eventually, you have to become somebody.
So perhaps a career in pig farming
awaits me, if only because I'm pretty
sure I'm not allowed to be a nun.
The Web site informs me
that livestock farmers
"move or rotate stock
to optimize feeding
opportunities"
and "direct and
oversee gen-

eral farm-

ing activities." Both these sound like fun and stimulating
opportunities to use my math major background and
"leadership skills." I'm only half joking; in all honesty,
farming pigs in Australia sounds better than many fates I
can think of, including, currently, the corporate world and
immediate transition to graduate school. Sounds much
better, if you ignore the "slaughtering them afterwards"
part.

I guess the thing to remember is that the future happens whether or not you've decided on it. That's kind of
hopeful. "Being is becoming," to appropriate from
Heidegger and the more pretentious half of my
Swarthmore education, or just "Life's a journey, not a destination," to appropriate from Aerosmith.
Either way, the point is that fearing the
future is pointless; there is a flow, and, by
Thor, I shall go with it.
But I'm still glad I've got another year.
Good luck to all seniors who are currently "in the job market" and also to all of
you juniors and under who will, at this
time next year, be reading my annual
"future anxiety" column, which will
probably be as close as one gets to a
publishable (if that) nervous breakdown. In the meantime, I've got to

help but wonder
are SMFs serious about love, or are
they just codependent?
Take, for example, Skipper. In his four years at Swat,
he's been in more relationships than PDCs. He gets into
new relationships as quickly as I run away from breasts,
and let me tell you, that is quick. Now, I don't mean that he
sleeps around. (Not that there's anything wrong with that.)
These are actual relationships that we're talking about.
We're talking courtship, monogamy and breaking up.

After breaking up, he gives himself a dating Sabbath, if
you will, rests up, and then is off and dating again.
The truly scary part is that he is not alone. He is but
one specimen of a strain of overachieving daters. It's like
they took an honors seminar on relationships and now
have it down to a social science. They have a mantra of the
five W's: who to target, what to wear, where to make the
move, when to suggest exclusivity, and hey, why the hell
not? I would argue that the "who to target" question determines the answers to the other four W's.

After breaking up, he gives himself a
dating Sabbath, if you will, rests up,
and then is off and dating again.
I know. "Who to target" sounds like you're trying to get
someone to take a survey or buy a hair product. But, seriously, that is how Serial Monogamist Fiends function. If
not, they wouldn't be able to call themselves serial. They
constantly have to be on top of who's hot and who owns a
yacht. Ideally, they find another SMF who can reciprocate
their need for being in a relationship. And how does one
identify a potential SMF counterpart? There are sure
signs. They just broke up with someone. They look like
they'd rather be dining on chicken croquettes with a lover
than their friends. Etc., etc.
Unfortunately for the SMFs, there comes a time when
they do run out of other SMFs to date. It's their own fault
for speeding through relationships like it's Dash for Cash.

April 3, 2003

What this means is that they start considering options that
really aren't viable. Unviable options include those who do
not recognize that the world exists outside of McCabe,
those who do not recognize that the world exists outside of
religion and those who do not recognize that the world
exists outside of their sports team. When an SMF targets
one of these lost causes, it's truly quite spectacular. It's
like a fashion disaster that you just can't take your eyes off
of. You know Gucci should not be worn with Old Navy, but
the absurdity of it all keeps you glued.
So if a friend of yours advises you to go after some girl
who clearly has no interest in dating outside of her bubble,
you might have to sit that friend down and initiate an SMF
intervention. Because if they cannot recognize that it is better to be single than to go after someone who's more familiar with the Dewey decimal system than Paces or Olde Club,
then they clearly are lost in a serial monogamy haze. It
would be incorrect for me to conclude that all SMFs are
codependent, but sometimes you have to question their
thinking process. Is it really that awful to be single? So awful
that they would rather chase after someone who's so wrong
for them that even Myrt Westphal would not pair them up?
So for all you single folks out there, enjoy your single
state of being. A bottle of lube or a Hello Kitty vibrator
isn't so bad when compared to the walking horrors that
haunt this liberal arts institution. And for all of those who
are in relationships, please be sure that you're not trapped
in an SMF cycle. Figure out why you're in your relationship, and if the word "love" doesn't pop into your head
immediately, it might be time to heed this Michelle Kwan

freak's advice and seek an intervention.

life sat on shelves and were draped over the bed under the window. Near the door sat an

farms to urban blight. If you think of, say
Kansas, all you would think of is a flat land
full of farms. There is no weirdness to
creep in (other than the people).
Chris Gethard: As suburbanization
expands into more rural areas, new people
encounter old folklore and such. This
keeps stories alive for a very long time.
The bottom line is that there is no concrete

reason N.J. is so incredibly strange

some fresh bulldozer tracks. The governthe state's strangeness?

I was first turned on to the N.J. weirdness

Instead, we met a wizquotient by my older

His tale was tragic, yes. But it hardly
merits a whole column.
Fortunately, the editors of Weird N.J.

a biannual publication devoted
to the Garden State's most legendarily
bizarre places, agreed to answer a few
questions via e-mail. So, in lieu of a daring
exploit, I present Mark Sceurman and
Chris Gethard, professional New Jersey
explorers.
Magazine,

Kate Duffy: New Jersey seems to
contain an inordinate amount of weirdness. Does it siphon out of New York
City and Philadelphia?

Mark Sceurman: No, N.J.'s weirdness
is homespun. Being that it is one of the oldest colonies gives it an advantage. NY and
PA are old also, but who cares about them?
I think you need to have the "weird eye" to
notice these things that are all around you
in everyday life. Once you have that, everything just starts to look strange. Plus, the
state is so diversified from
mountains
to
shore to

KD: I ve always appreciated the fact
that you don't publish exact directions
to any of the strange sites. Instead,
readers write in about rumors they've
heard, like, "If you walk down some
train tracks near Clifton, then climb
down a ravine and into a sewage pipe,
you'll find a Satanic altar." Deducing
one's way to the I Am Temple in
Springfield, for instance, adds to the
sense of triumph one feels when one
finds it. Do you leave directions out on
purpose?
MS: Yes, for the most part. We feel that
people should find these places just as we
did: with cryptic directions, no directions
or simply stumbled upon. Sites on private
property we won't direct people to. Doing a
publication with this kind of subject matter lends itself to people with no regard for
private property or [who] wouldn't think
twice about breaking into a closed up
building. But it's their choice, as we always
state. But that is really just a small percentage of the readers. Most people have
common sense just to want to know that
these places exist somewhere.

the most eccentric person you've met?
MS: I think my favorite local hero was
the guy who built a time machine out of
wood and claimed it could travel 350 miles
an hour on a county road. Of course, he
used to see dancing toast in his backyard
also.
CG: Ed Geil, the Roadside Elvis. Every
day this guy goes to Garret Mountain in
Paterson, dressed as Elvis mind you, and
does karaoke of old Elvis tunes. He brings
Wavin' Dolores with him each time. They
are definitely off center!

KD: Why are there so many abandoned insane asylums in New Jersey?
The state is practically ridden with
them.

MS: There are so many abandoned hospitals because with the advent of better
drugs, the mentally challenged folks have a

better chance of living a normal life outside
of wards and rubber rooms.
CG: When most of these asylums were
built, they were considered incredibly
humane. But as overcrowding inevitably
overtook most of them, they became dangerous, understaffed, etc. These days mental health is treated much differently, mak-

these institutions obsolete. So they

ing

stand as a reminder of how things used to

be..
KD: Will New Jersey ultimately succumb to suburban homogenization?
CG: There is definitely too much suburban development these days. Even when
you get out to rural areas of N.J., you'll
now see condos and developments and
such. It's heartbreaking and disappointing
to be in a little town that's off the beaten

path only to find these clusters of cookie
cutter housing. Hopefully it doesn't ruin
the character of the state
there's definitely

a chance that all this suburban

sprawl could do just that.
MS: I don't think so. If you ever travel
around the southwestern part of the state,
it is like a totally different state of mind.
Miles and miles of fields and abandonment.
Even up north in Sussex county, where
established homes and property have been
the same for many years, they seem to hold
onto what they've got. We have found out
in our years of travels that it's a big little

state!

A taste of college
Though we may have our doubts when we pull
another all-nighter or stare, humbled, at another unappetizing test grade, we all know why we're here. We're
smart kids who wanted to live among other smart kids.
We like to keep our heads in our books.
So why all the resistance to the weekday spec program? Why all the emphasis on giving specs the "social
experience" of Swarthmore? We don't exactly have a
raging party culture, and most specs are smart people
who understand that a college experience ought to be
about academic development more than socialization.
College ought to be balanced. The majority of
prospective students who come here are looking for
academic intensity; otherwise, they wouldn't've applied
here. But the ultimate choice they make from among
the highly competitive schools available to them will
probably be based on the balance of fun and work the
school provides.
Also senior year may be a blowoff year for some, but some people really do value their classwork at the
end of the year, and it's inconsiderate to ask them to
choose between specking here and studying for APs.
Perhaps a spec weekday program could be available
for those who desire it, reducing the pressure on the
school when specs flood into the school on that one
April weekend. The opportunity for specs to meet each
other in smaller groups and see a normal Swarthmore
day without a major weekend disruption could and
should continue.
,

*

Screw specs, man
I'm not afraid to dissent. I see no purpose in having prospective students hosted at school each year.
Do we really need to attract any more students to this
school? We have too many as it is, and admitting a

whole new class next year will only make it more difficult for the administration to look after the needs of
those currently enrolled.
True, eventual student turnover may help maintain
the endowment, but capital campaigns can tide us over
long enough until our current first-years graduate. All
of us ought to get a chance to enjoy the privileges of
senior year without first-years scurrying underfoot.
Has Al Bloom investigated just how much the admissions staff costs in terms of foregone alcohol?
If we must have new specs, they must do a better
job of acknowledging their inferiority. Policy should
be to integrate sexual favors and toadying into any
spec-hosting program.

Corrections
In last week’s article “Oscar Wilde’s ‘An Ideal
Husband,”’ the scene described as the opening
of the play actually took place halfway through.
Also, the news article “More science center sections open” last week erroneously referred to a
special kind of glass that appears opaque from
the outside as “frigid glass.” It is actually called
“fritted glass."

April Fool's Phoenix not funny
Dear Editor:
I was quite offended by the decision of an eminent publication like The Phoenix to buckle to peer pressure and
engage in the quite literal "foolishness" of the April Fool's
Day holiday. Is there no better way to spend our publishing
budget than to run an issue full of facile, banal jokes?
This self-indulgent nonsense is an affront to journalism
and a disservice to The Phoenix's readers, who, not being
"clued in" to Swarthmore current events, may have mistaken your misinformation for real reporting. I understand
that your publishing schedule meant you could not publish
on April 1, but this meant that your March 27 issue may
have led many astray. Even the most irresponsible
pranksters traditionally leave an "April Fool's!" at the end
of their prank as a marginal sign of consideration to their
victims to disabuse them of the lie; could not the Phoenix
staff have shared its readers the same courtesy?
Picking out the most obvious false stories was a timeconsuming task, given the utter lack of clear signposting,
but ultimately not difficult. Your benignly amusing piece
about a fictitious student, Hollis Easter, pursuing serious
academic study in the bagpipes, of all things ("Student wins
fellowship to study the bagpipes," pg. 6) was amusing but so
ludicrous a concept as to be hardly worth a titter.
More serious was your blatantly libelous "Students
protest invasion of Iraq," pg. 3. Those of us who have been
at Swarthmore a while get the joke, but naive outsiders
might get the impression that this sort of radical, antiAmerican behavior is common among our students. All it
takes is a few such "jokes" to destroy our reputation as a
moderate, rational center of American learning.
Finally, your assertion that construction on the science
center is actually proceeding ("More science center sections
open," pg. 3) was simply insensitive and offensive to natural
science majors, as was your mocking jest that spring had
arrived (photo caption, pg. 2) toward the whole student

body.

14

to

Your living section was less problematic, confining itself
mostly to advertising performances of obviously nonexistent bands, but your hamhanded attempts at political satire
here only make your opponents look better by comparison.
Criticize the importance of some reserved-students e-mails
if you wish, but there's no need to get ridiculous and compare them to announcements about lost change purses or
solar car projects.
Also, I found the decision to Photoshop in images of
paper products icon Mr. Whipple and Thunder Alley's Ed
Asner as mailroom workers at Swarthmore baffling, to say
the least. It's certainly strange, but is it funny? On the other
hand, your oddly fetishistic posing of antique haberdasher's
mannequins as actors in some sort of school theatrical production crossed the line from baffling to disturbing.
Your opinions section was simply in bad taste. Maybe
you thought a headshot of an African-American with bad
hair next to an article filled with racial slurs was an appropriate attempt at race-based humor, but I, for one, find it
bordering on hate speech and am not amused. With your
attitudes, it is no wonder you people haven't been able to
hire any black columnists. Similarly, stealing a speech from
ex-president Richard Milhous Nixon and attributing it to a
random Swarthmore Christian Fellowship member may be
appear at first to be an interesting bit of metanarrative commentary but is ultimately no more than a juvenile prank.
Finally, on behalf of all scholar-athletes, I urge you to
retract the idiotic caricature of sports culture you wrote up
in your "Josh Loeffler" column, exceeded in offense to athletic culture only by your inexcusable statement that track
team members should be considered athletes ("New field
brings improvements, inconveniences," pg. 22).
If this kind of incomprehensible nonsense is the only
sort of satire or humor The Phoenix can dredge up for April
Fool's Day, perhaps it would be better not to participate in
the tradition.

luckily, we have the American

There's an ongoing myth of a liberal media, which one hopes

massive overgeneralizations of the professional electronic news

U.S. should

ronan

The United States' liberation of Iraq must extend past the
Iraqi border. It must encompass a direct effort to eliminate
those who physically aid Saddam Hussein in killing
American soldiers in the name of preserving his murderous
regime. Though many have been vocal in their support for
Saddam, only a distinct few have made gestures of tangible
support. Most notable among these is Syria, a nation with an
atrocious history of harboring terrorism and violating fundamental human rights. Though it has feigned interest in
cooperating with the United States in the past, its support of
Iraq has reached a critical level. The elimination of this support would hasten Saddam's defeat and protect American
lives.
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld recently
announced that the United States would hold the Syrian government "accountable" for its
"hostile acts." Specifically, he
was referring to the shipment of

military supplies across the
Syrian-Iraqi border. These supplies, which include weapons
and night vision goggles, come
from mostly Eastern European
countries to Syria, which then
passes them directly to Iraq in
exchange for lucrative oil deals.
Not only are Syrian transfers a
hindrance to the United States'
liberation effort, they are in

direct violation of the United
Nations arms embargo on Iraq.
Surely the same leftists who are
so wont to spout the United
States' U.N. violations cannot
ignore this infringement.

If Syria's involvement were
simply limited to illegal smuggling, United States intervention would be completely justified. This justification
becomes necessity in light of the fact that 2,500 Hezbollah
guerillas are moving through Syria, toward Iraq, to join the
fight against the United States. Though poorly informed college students may have once been able to convince themselves that Hezbollah wanted nothing more than to "liberate" southern Lebanon, it is now painfully obvious that it is

indeed a direct enemy of the United States.
Hezbollah operates from Southern Lebanon's Bekaa
Valley, a region forcefully controlled by Syria since the end
of the bloody Lebanese civil war in 1990. In addition to allowing Hezbollah this safe haven, Syria, with help from Iran,
has supplied the group with weapons, training and money to
fund its terrorist activity against Israel. This alone merits a
Syrian place in President Bush's "axis of evil."
If the typical Swattie has made it this far into my column,
he or she has chalked my opinion off as Jacksonian hogwash
and justified Syria's actions as a tantamount reaction to
United States imperialism. The truth, however, is that
Syrian-sponsored Hezbollah is a terrorist group of global
reach, one that has targeted Israelis and Americans worldwide for more than two decades. This includes kidnappings,
embassy bombings, airplane hijackings and suicide bombings. Syria has supported the massacre of innocent civilians
since Hezbollah's inception in 1982. Its support of Saddam
Hussein is not a result of our military operations against
Iraq but more a result of our lack of effective military oper-

ations against Syria.
Sheikh Ahmed Kaftaro, Syria's Mufti and highest Muslim
religious authority, recently called on all Muslims to engage
in "martyrdom operations" against American forces in Iraq.
It is a sick culture that sends its children to kill themselves
for a hopeless cause. This kind of leadership does nothing
but a disservice to the Syrian people. That government's
support for terrorist efforts against the United States is noth-

ing short of a declaration of war. The American toppling of
the Syrian threat and by extension Lebanese terrorist forces
would be a service to the region. The Middle East liberation
cannot stop with Iraq. Those members of the League of Arab
States, beginning with Syria, that are so willing to take
American lives must be eliminated. If we do not destroy the
threat in the Middle East, surely that threat will fulfill its

More 'reality,' high ratings
BY BEN WILES

bwilesl@swarthmore.edu

Saddam Hussein and his compatriots have been
using the Iraqi television network, in conjunction with
the Arab television station al-Jazeera, to communicate
with the Iraqi people and the international community
at large. But why haven't I seen any Iraqi or al-Jazeera
footage except for Saddam's address once the war started and pictures of beat-up American POWs? It's undeniable that American coverage has been one-sided.
Shouldn't I be able to access a news channel that reports
both American and Iraqi casualties? Lord knows I can
get six that don't. Can I please get a channel that doesn't
rely exclusively on military analysts (retired generals),
current generals and "embedded" reporters? Nope. And
don't tell me the coverage is one-sided because it's
American, as if that's OK.
Some of my friends attribute this one-sidedness to a
vast corporate media conspiracy. I think it's because alJazeera's programming needs a little more spice.
Watching Arabs in turbans dance around a downed
chopper doesn't really hold my attention. Watching
"real" people lead "real" lives on MTV does. Why not
give the international community an Iraqi reality show?
Basra would be a pregnant setting. Imagine following an
Iraqi bus driver from, say, last Monday 'til today. He
gets a call from one of his buddies that the Americans
are coming, and the family reacts. Close-ups of a sobbing
wife and bewildered children ensue. Cut to commercial.
Then he goes to the depot to saddle up, but the bombs
come before he makes it. He spends three nights under
the desert moon, trying to find his family and friends.
Then he meets up with his neighbor, who hands him a
rifle and three grenades. He reunites with his wife and
cheers with the Baa'th bigwig in the central square. The
April

3, 2003

streets are littered with corpses. Credits roll.
I say al-Jazeera should start out with four or five
international heads of state. These leaders would then
endure nonsensical abuse at the hands of the United
States. It would be full of angry domestic crowds, effigies
and bad haircuts. Iran's Khatami would have to watch a

U.S. bomb careen into one of his oil refineries and then
sit in on the U.S. press conference where American generals would deny the whole thing. (To be really cruel, alJazeera could make Khatami watch CNN cover the general's press conference the next day.) Spain's Jose Maria
Aznar would get a "special visit" from Wolfowitz and
then have to read the El Mundo headlines for a week. His
hair would gray and his wrinkles deepen as he read that
91 percent of Spaniards oppose the war. We'd watch him
try to explain himself to his exasperated supporters and
then see him vent their same frustrations in private. We
could watch a score ofMiddle Eastern leaders squirm as
Baghdad bombings turned their constituents against the

United States.
Al-Jazeera reality shows would be far more entertaining than the nationalist drivel al-Jazeera currently
runs. But the reality shows I've mentioned are actually
struggling now. Americans follow CNN and Fox News
these days rather than staples like "Real World" and
"Fear Factor." Twenty-four-hour news channels have
become our new reality shows. The American media's
coverage of the war is fundamentally incomplete, as
journalists like Peter Arnett are discredited and
ignored. Television news producers create hourly storylines with scraps of footage and scripted commentary.
You know the interview clips sprinkled throughout reality shows? They somehow hold your attention, distracting you from an emptiness seeping up from the pit of
your stomach. Kind of like Diet Coke. A lot like watching

CNN commentary.

Contending with two nationally ranked
teams this week, the Swarthmore women's
lacrosse team dropped games to 15th-ranked
Franklin and Marshall and seventh-ranked
Gettysburg on March 27 and 29.
Although the Garnet jumped out to a 3-1
lead against F&M, the women could not
preserve control of the game, as the final
score favored the Diplomats 15-6. Junior
Jackie Kahn 'O4 propelled the team to an
early 2-1 lead. Christina Vu 'O6 added a goal
to up the Garnet to 3-1, but F&M gained
composure and responded with the next six
goals. With a halftime score of 7-3,
Swarthmore recharged itself, aiming to
take back the lead. F&M broke the silence
of the second half with a goal, putting it up
8-3, but Kahn answered and cut the lead by
one to 8-4. Lucy Lang 'O3 and Heidi
Fiesselman 'O6 chipped in a goal each, but
the Diplomats had already run away with
the victory. Sam Uslan 'O3 recorded 21
saves in the contest.
On March 29, the women competed
against seventh-ranked Gettysburg at home
on Cunningham Field. Ranked number one
in the Centennial Conference season poll,
the Bullets arrived at Swarthmore ready to
challenge the Garnet. Led by senior Megan
Murphy, the Bullets took command of the
first minutes of play, building a 6-0 lead. Vu
connected on Swarthmore's only goal in the
first half. Going into the second half,
Gettysburg held a 9-1 lead. The Bullets never
let up, finishing off the contest 17-2. Kahn
contributed the final goal for Swarthmore.
Jamie Larson 'O6 earned an assist, while
Uslan recorded 14 saves. Gettysburg
improved to 8-0 overall and 2-0 in the conference. Swarthmore fell to 3-3 overall, 0-2 in
the conference.
On the season, the team has posted 14
total assists and 52 goals, tallying a shooting
percentage of 31 percent. Kahn leads the
team with 25 goals (40 percent shooting) and
two assists, equaling a total of 27 points.

First-years Fieselmann and Niamh Shortt
'O6 have netted seven goals a piece and

assisted on five and two goals respectively.
Uslan has recorded 363 minutes in goal, 80
saves, and a 56 percent save percentage.
Garnet fall to Shorewomen
On Tuesday, the Tide faced Centennial
Conference opponent Washington College
(8-0, 4-0) on the new athletic turf. The
Shorewomen arrived at Swarthmore, hungry for a victory and looking to continue
their undefeated streak. Washington junior
Janet Studdiford scored her first of four
goals on the night at 0:36 into the game. For
Studdiford, it was the hundredth goal of her
career. Riding adrenaline, Shorewomen
posted the next four goals on the board, leading the game 5-0. Frustrated, Swarthmore
was eager to win back some momentum.
At 16:56 in the first half, Kahn beat
Washington goaltender Ashley Crisler to
put the Garnet on the board. Washington
closed the half, however, with a goal from

Studdiford as Washington ended the half
with a 6-1 lead.
Washington added two more goals to
start the second half, expanding the lead to
8-1 just 6:25 into the second. Kahn quickly
responded to the bombardment with a goal

43 seconds later. Washington then scored
the next four goals to put the game just out
of reach. Fieselmann added a goal with 2:35
remaining in the game to close out the scoring. Sam Uslan made 22 saves in her 60 minutes of play, while Crisler stopped 12 of
Swarthmore's shots. Washington's Casey
Swama finished the game with four goals as
well.
Swarthmore dropped to 3-4 overall and 03 in the conference. The team will take on
Widener
opponent
non-conference
University at Widener on Thursday at 4
p.m. Lead by Nicole Jiulianti, the Pioneers
had a 7-2 overall record and are 4-1 in the

Mid-Atlantic conference.

Lehigh tops wounded Buzzards
BY MARK JANOFF
mjanoffl@swarthmore.edu
The Evil Buzzards got out to an earlier lead on Saturday but could not hold
on, losing 27-5 to Lehigh in the home opener on Cunningham Field. The loss
sent Swarthmore to 0-2 on the season.
The Buzzards started the game on a high note, as eight-man Zach "Lenny"
Gelacek 'O3 trotted past the Lehigh defense for a try, putting Swarthmore up

5-0.
The squad also had an early leg up in the fashion department
the
Buzzards sported their usual garnet and black rugby shirts, while Lehigh
showed up for the contest in standard white T-shirts and black shorts. "The
problem with Lehigh's lack of uniform wasn't really that they looked like a
mess," fly-half Jon Fombonne 'O5 said. "It was just that it was really hard to
bring down their fat guys by their shirts because they would rip. Actually, a
few of them looked like they were wearing belly shirts."
Lehigh proved more formidable than appearance suggested, however, as it
rattled off three quick scores to take a 15-5 halftime lead. "The first three tries
were in fairly quick succession," wing Erik Munroe 'O4 said. "There were just
a few break downs on each team, where some kid would break through a few
tackles, and there would be a crumbling front from there."
Despite Swarthmore's halftime deficit, the Buzzards felt they had played
better overall rugby than Lehigh in the first half. "We scored early,"
Fombonne said. "They had a couple of breakaways in the first half, but we
definitely outplayed them."
In the second half, Lehigh managed to hold off the Swarthmore attack and
secure a 27-5 lead.
Munroe attributed the loss in large part to the loss of several players to
injury. Flanker Brendan Bond 'O5, prop Brandon Carver 'O4 and inside center Axel Neff 'O3 were all sidelined for the contest. "We had a couple of
injuries, but the kids filling in did a really good job," Munroe said. "We actually dominated the game. We had the ball at least 70 percent of the time."
Some of the players who stepped up to fill in for the injured starters
were Jeff Rogg 'O5, who saw some time at flanker, and "Crazy" Greg Nelson
'O4, who played various positions. Rugby president Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5
filled in for Carver, while starter Brandt Rakowski 'O6 moved over to inside

center.
Despite their dominating performance, the Evil Buzzards could not piece
together a complete game from whistle to whistle. "Sometimes, if you're playing with guys you're not used to playing with for an entire game, you don't
have the non-verbal communication down," Munroe said. "Then you get little mess-ups occasionally, and Lehigh just took advantage."
This weekend, the Buzzards will head to the University of Pennsylvania to
compete in the Penn Rugby Tournament. On Saturday, Swarthmore will face
Widener and The College of New Jersey in shortened games. The Buzzards'
record will determine who they play on Sunday.

A group of Buzzards takes down a Lehigh player during Saturday's game. Swarthmore lost 27-5.

Ultimate wins a pair at Haverford
The women's ultimate team went undefeated last Saturday at the Haverford Pigout
Layout tournament, defeating Johns Hopkins
13-1 and Haverford 13-2. "We played really
well," Carolynn Laurenza 'O3 said. "The team
had a really good time together."
The light competition gave new and return-

ing players a chance to gain invaluable playing
time and experience. "It was really awesome to
see the new players getting playing time right
alongside everyone else," Laurenza said. She
was particularly impressed with the play of
two first-years, Jonna Seavey and Mae TobinHochstadt, as well as two returning seniors,
Sanya Carley and Ingrid Kaszas.
The Warmothers also had the opportunity
to scrimmage University of Delaware, one of
the teams expected to qualify for nationals.

This weekend, the Warmothers are expecting much more competition at the Spring
Phling tournament at Penn State. The team,
seeded fifth in the tournament, will likely face
several nationally ranked teams. "This is going
to be a much more serious tournament."
The Warmothers are hoping the stiff competition will prepare them for sectionals. "This
is the last tournament before sectionals,"
Laurenza said.
The men's ultimate team finished 2-2 at

the Pigout

Layout tournament at

Haverford

last weekend. The result fell far short of

expectations.
Although the team opened the tournament

18

with a win over their Haverford host 9-8, they

were disappointed with their play from the
onset. "We came out flat, and we never really
recovered from that," Paul Wulfsberg 'O3 said.
The next game, the Earthworms lost to
Skidmore 13-7. "Skidmore is a team we usuaUy
beat pretty handily," Wulfsberg said.
In the next game, the Earthworms put in an
all-first-year

lineup

that

Haverford Alumni. After the

challenged the
starting lineup

lost the first five points, the first-years re-energized the team by capturing two points. "An allfreshman lineup hustled a lot more then our
previous lines," Wulfsberg said.
The Earthworms closed out the tournament
with a win over the Penn State B team, 13-1 L
After the tournament, John Anderson 'O3
reflected on the performance. "We need to keep
in mind that great teams can have bad days.
And when great teams have bad days, it's easy
to get really mad and frustrated, because great

teams aren't accustomed to having bad days."
Wulfsberg attributes some of the team's
woes at the Pigout Layout to the inclement

weather. "We haven't been a very good bad
weather team," he said.
Unfortunately, the weather this weekend
wiU not improve at the. Spring Phling tournament at Penn State. "There will be snow on the
ground, and the fields whl be really muddy, so
we need to come out a lot more intense,"
Wulfsberg said.

The women's tennis team is on a roll. With two
more Centennial Conference victories under their
belts, the Garnet Tide are a perfect 5-0 in CC play and
are asserting themselves as the team to beat in the
conference.
Last weekend, they defeated Dickinson 7-2 and
Franklin and Marshall 8-1 to improve their record to 72 overall, 5-0 CC.
The Tide defeated F&M 8-1 on Saturday to preserve
their undefeated record at home. As with previous CC
matches, the Tide claimed the momentum early in the
match. "During the F&M match, the girls started out
strong, sweeping all three doubles," Kristina Pao 'O4
said.
On Sunday, the Garnet defeated the Dickinson Red
Devils (4-2, 1-2 CC). The team overcame a Dickinson
squad, enjoying the benefits of a strong home court
advantage. "At Dickinson, the team had to face
adverse conditions and adjust to a very fast indoor
multi-purpose facility," head coach Jeremy Loomis
said. "I'm very proud with the way we handled that

and used the environment to our favor rather than
fight against it."
The Garnet once again jumped off to a fast start
with an 8-0 victory by Megan Speare 'O5 and Katherine
Voll 'O3 at third doubles. "It's that type of quick strike
which is going to be important for this weekend,"
Loomis said.
This weekend, the squad is heading south to face
two top teams in the region, Rhodes College and
University of the South. Coach Loomis believes these
matches will be a great litmus test for the team.
"The next two opponents are considered some of
the best the region has to offer. I think we can be there

right with them if we can be assertive and get the
advantage early," he said. "It's going to be a great test
for our team and should reflect the improvement
we've made as a team so far this year."
With many underclassmen filling starting spots on
the roster, the team understands that it has plenty of
room to gain experience and improve its game. "I'm
amazed at the progress each girl has made. I've been
able to watch parts of Elli's [Suzuki 'o6] and Emily's
[Townsend 'o6] matches in particular, and it's great to
see how much the freshmen have improved," Pao said.
"I can't imagine how strong the team will be next
year," she said. "But, until then, we're really looking
forward to our trip to Tennessee."
Last Saturday, the men's tennis team eked out a 4-3
win against Washington and Lee, a team ranked 14th

in the nation by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association

(ITA).
After picking up

the doubles point with a comefrom-behind victory by Justin Singer 'O3 and Mike
Noreika 'O4, the team picked up crucial victories from
first-years Brian Park at sixth singles and Zach Rodd
at fourth singles.
With the team score tied at three apiece, Ben Rae
'O4 was just two games from losing his game-deciding
match. He dropped the first set to his opponent,
Jordan Eichenberger, and was down 4-0 in the second
set; however, Rae grabbed the next 11 games to win the
fifth singles match 1-6, 6-4, 6-2. Jayson Yost 'O3

described the win as "miraculous."
"It was a big win for us ,because they are ranked
ahead of us in the region," Rae said.
With this victory under its belt, the team is traveling to Tennessee to face two more teams ranked ahead
of them, Rhodes College and University of the South.

Williams takes third place in 400-meter hurdles
jdaltonl@swarthmore.edu

Amidst overcast conditions, the Garnet outdoor
track and field teams had a great showing at the wellattended 2003 Danny Curran Invitational at Widener
University last Saturday. With a number of athletes
coming off of injuries and contributing for the first
time all season, the Garnet are beginning to display
their talents as a cohesive unit.
From the women's side, the trio of Elizabeth
Gardner 'O5, Njideka Akunyili 'O4 and Claire
Hoverman 'O3 captured first, second and third in the
women's 800-meter dash, with times of 2:17.24, 2:18.24,
and 2:20.24 respectively.
"I had a good race on Saturday because of our
Tuesday and Thursday track workouts," Akunyili
said. "These workouts push you to give more than
you think you can. The advantage of this is that,
when you finally race, you do not doubt your
strength."
In the women's 1500-meter run, Sarah Hobbs 'O6
finished sixth with a time of 5:05.24. Jessica Zagory
'O5 placed fifth in the women's high jump, clearing
4'10". Molly Maurer 'O6 finished fourth in the
women's 5000-meter run with a time of 19:20.24. In the
women's pole vault, Sarah Kate Selling 'O3 and
Catherine Clark 'O4 placed sixth, clearing 7'06".
The women's 4x400 meter relay A team finished
second with a time of 4:10.24, while the women's 4x400
meter relay B team placed eighth with a time of
4:25.24.

third in the men's 400-meter hurdles with a time of
57.14 seconds. Williams also finished fourth in the
men's 110-meter hurdles with a time of 16.04 seconds.
In the 5000-meter run, Garrett Ash 'O5 took home
first with a speedy time of 15:38.24. Lang Reynolds 'O5
finished close behind him, placing third with a time
of 16:00.24.
"Our team has begun to display a great deal of collective energy, and I think it really rubbed off on me
especially, since I ran one of the last events of the
day," Ash said. "After watching my teammates step
up so well, especially Keefe Keeley 'O6 and Jorge
Aguilar 'O5 who ran their best times of the season in
the 800 and 1500 respectively, I was really inspired to
go out and run a good race. Having Lang back healthy
and in shape to run with me helped as well."
Reynolds commented on his return from an injury
that kept him off the track during the winter season.
"That was the first 5K I've run on the track since last
spring at outdoor conferences, and it felt really good
to race it again," Reynolds said. "I'd really like to
qualify for nationals in the SK, but I'll have to get a
bit faster before I can really consider that. After missing the indoor season due to injury, this may not be
possible, but I'm going to give it a shot."
James Golden 'O5 finished third in the men's 800meter dash with a time of 1:57.24. Zach Zaitlin 'O6
placed fifth in the men's triple jump with a jump of
12.19 meters. Rob Melick 'O3 placed ninth in the men's
shot put, reaching a mark of 13.10 meters.
The men's 4x400-meter relay A team placed seventh at 3:37.24, while the men's 4x400-meter relay B
team placed ninth with a time of 3:50.24.

That's right.
Six of us ponied up and spent $4O
on a pay-per-view wrestling
event. Now, after writing these
two sentences, I assume that
there are a few select thoughts
entering the heads of most of you
readers. If you are a wrestling
fan, you might be nodding your
head up and down in recognition
of individuals who spent hardearned money and valuable time
in order to appreciate a fine
night of athletic entertainment.
Given
that
we
are
at
Swarthmore, an institution not
possessing a great portion of professional

wrestling

viewers,

other thoughts are probably run-

ning through the heads of most of you.
Let me guess. Some of you just wondered ifI

am so stupid as
to believe that professional wrestling is a real sport. Others just
wondered how childish I really am. And yet others are questioning my level of intelligence, given that you probably view
wrestling as the dumbest form of entertainment available.
These are all inquiries that we wrestling fans constantly
receive. We wrestling fans have become fairly adept at fielding
these questions and do not mind responding to them. So, I will
now demonstrate to you, the reader, why my expenditures over
the weekend were warranted and why, even though enjoyment
of wrestling is purely based on taste, those of you who dislike
wrestling are wrong.
To start things off, I do know that wrestling is fake. But so
are movies, television shows (even 99 percent of the "reality
shows") and any sporting event involving Don King. Still, I find
all of these things to be entertaining. The simple fact that professional wrestling is fake does not mean that it cannot entertain. Instead of focusing on the lack of reality inherent in
wrestling, you should just sit back and enjoy the event.
Wrestling presents us with tremendous athletes running
around, jumping off ropes, doing flips and beating each other
senseless. Do not try to give me the standard line that wrestlers
do not really hit or hurt each other either. True, they do not
intentionally try to injure the other wrestler, but there is an
amazing amount of contact involved. The fact that wrestling is
fake allows this contact to take place, as each wrestler knows
what the other will do next and can brace himself for the next
move of the opponent. So, yes, I understand that wrestling has
long ago decided on the winner of a match, and that they are not
really punching each other in the face repeatedly. But I also
understand that the flips are real (anyone who saw Brock
Lesnar under-rotate and almost paralyze himself will attest to
this), most of the hits are real, and the sheer athleticism of the

wrestlers is real.
Also, I resent the fact that I am called childish for watching
wrestling. Is wrestling childish? Maybe. But so is anime, or
Farrelly Brothers humor, or reading fantasy literature. Simply,
what ever made acting like a child so bad? I, for one, do not really want to grow up, and if viewing wrestling means that I am
clinging to my youth, then thank God. I will watch wrestling for
a long time, and I hope it never allows me to fully mature.
To all of you who might be questioning my intelligence: Yes,
wrestling is dumb. It is dumb that I cheer for my favorite
wrestlers. It is dumb that I care about plot lines in the shows. It
is dumb. Then again, most entertainment is dumb. It is stupid
that we are crushed when a favorite team loses or a favorite
character is taken away from a show. But who cares?
Entertainment presents us with an opportunity to breathe, to
escape the real world. I can think of no better opportunity to
take a break than professional wrestling. It involves bad acting,
violence, athleticism and hot girls. In short, it incorporates
everything you could ever need to sit back and watch mindlessly. Considering all the scholarly work we have at this school,
wrestling might just be the antidote to the daily routine.
Then again, wrestling might not be the antidote for you.
That is fine with me. Just know that we wrestling fans might
enjoy stupid entertainment, but that does not make us stupid.
And until you give wrestling a chance, do not brush it aside
carelessly and without a hint of attention. You might just be
missing out.

More Madness
A little Madness in the Spring
Is wholesome even for the King.
-Emily Dickinson (1830-1886)
I don't do this whole bracket thing. I
like to sit back and listen to the buzz
about different pools, different players,
and this year's possible Cinderella. And
while his familiarity with the announcing procedure for a women's lax game is
debatable, Jloefs columns have kept me
up with the campus bracket scene. I've
already jumped on the Marquette bandwagon, simply because espn.com is only
writing about the Golden Eagles these
KATE NELSON-LEE
days, and let's face it, baseball is at it's
worst in the opening weeks. (Jeter out
Up in the Skybox
with a dislocated shoulder? Really, he
was one of the few not-fat players who
was actually hot, tsk Ken Huckaby).
But it's April now, so the whole March Madness thing is over, and
we can finally sit down and watch the games that count: the Final
Four. And while the men's side gets 99.9 percent of the public interest,
this time of the tourney means that the women's side has finally gotten interesting. Well, perhaps not interesting per se, but with three No
L seeds in the four, it's the best chance of an exciting game that the
women's side will get, at least until there's more parity in women's
hoops.

A Jloef-esque breakdown of the cream of the crop:
Mideast No. 1 Tennessee (32-4) vs. Midwest No. 1 Duke (35-1)
Sunday, April 6, 7:07 p.m. EST
Tennessee: The Vols (I refuse to use the "Lady," and I'll spare you
the feminist argument that is long and boring), long one of the dominating forces in the women's game, have four regular season losses to
ranked teams. The two most important? A 63-62 loss to UConn early in
the season, and, notably, a 76-55 L to then No. 1 Duke. But with the winningest coach in women's hoops, Pat Summit, the Vols have beaten
their tourney opponents by an average of 33.5 points, and, aside from a
loss in the SEC finals, they have won 21 of their last 22 games.
Marquee Player: Gwen Jackson, leading team with 16.3 ppg going
into tourney.
Duke: The Blue Devil's road to the four has been less of a points
domination and more of a quest for the ring that will cap of the dynasty.
Two straight unbeaten ACC seasons, first women's team to win four
consecutive ACC titles, and the sixth program in DI to have three
straight 30-plus win seasons. This team has all the talent and all the
experience it needs to cap off a dynamic year.
Marquee Player: Alana Beard, considered one of the three best players in the country. The Devils are 88-9 since Beard started playing.
East No. 1 Connecticut (35-1) vs. West No. 2 Texas (29-5)
Sunday, April 6, time TBA
Connecticut: If you haven't heard about this year's UConn team,
then you spend too much time in McCabe. The Huskies only loss this
season to local Villanova broke the longest winning streak in women's
bball, 70 consecutive wins. Everyone has been talking about how UConn
isn't as good this year as it has been in the past. They graduated three,
yes, three All-Americans, and they're returning just one starter from
last year's 39-0 team. And while the Huskies aren't perfect this year,
they are decidedly title contenders with a starting lineup of one junior,
two sophomores and three freshmen. Pundits point to coach Geno
Auriemma's leadership as the reason behind the team's success.
Marquee Player: Diana Taurasi, voted the best player in the country.
'Nuff said.
Texas: Texas is the sole No. 2 seed in the four. The Longhorns beat
down LSU 78-60 to earn the team's first trip to the four in 16 years. The
Longhorns had a breakout season, with their first Big 12 regular season
title and first league tourney crown. Currently on a 21 win streak, Texas
is the women's version of a Cinderella team.
Marquee Player: Stacy Stephens, 6'l" post player, leads a balanced
Longhorn offensive threat.

Tide fall to no. 16 McDaniel
BY ERIKA DOYLE

They say it's not about winning or losing. It's
all about how you play the game. This motto
proved true for our Garnet men this past week. On
Saturday, the men's lacrosse team (4-4,1-2 CC) fell
to McDaniel on home turf, but the players fought
hard against the Green Terror, ranked 16th in the
nation by the United States Intercollegiate
Lacrosse Association.
Earlier in the week, the Garnet Tide stomped
on Ursinus College (4-2), earning their first
Centennial Conference victory of the season.

Ellis scored five goals to lead McDaniel (7-0,3-0 CC)

to the victory. At the end of the game, McDaniel's
transition offense proved a bit of a challenge for
the Garnet. "They scored a majority of their goals
in transition. A couple of errant passes and broken
clears gave them the edge," co-captain Than Court

'O3 said.

Leading Swarthmore's scoring, Court and Joe

DeSimone 'O4 contributed two goals apiece. At
11:26, Pat Friel 'O3 scored a man-up goal from a Tim
Chryssikos 'O5 assist to get the Garnet Tide into
the game. With five minutes left in the half,
DeSimone cut the Green Terror lead in half, scor-
