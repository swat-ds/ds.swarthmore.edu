College Beginning to Expand Foreign Study Opportunities
By

Min Lee

The face of the Swarthmore foreign study
program has changed significantly in the past
six years. Before these changes were made,
Steven Piker, foreign study advisor and professor of sociology/anthropology, considered
the program to be "in large part, if not entirely, chaotic." Now, however, the College
has expanded its offerings from a program at
the University of Grenoble in France to include programs at the University of Ghana,
the Universidad de la Frontera in Chile, and,
most recently, the University of Tokyo in
Japan.
"As we live in a more and more interna-

tionalist world," said President Al Bloom, "it
becomes incumbent upon Swarthmore to
educate and provide preparation for its students to engage in and to contribute to that
world, both on campus and through foreign
study programs."
The College now recognizes foreign study
programs all over the world; as Foreign Study
Advisor Steve Piker jokingly commented,
"There are no foreign study programs in
Antarctica," but the possibilities are endless.
Beginning under the presidency of David
Fraser, the school began to pay more attention to learning opportunities outside of the
country. Said Piker, "President Fraser started
developing an educationalrationale that made

sense for Swarthmore to have a definite foreign study program, and made an effort to see
to the establishment of such a program." In
1988, the Blue Ribbon Committee was formed
under the supervision of Dean Janet
Dickerson, subsequently setting a list of
propositions for the creation of a foreign
study program. All the propositions were
approved by the administration and faculty,
providing the ground rules under which the
current Foreign Study Office and the Foreign
Study Committee operate.
Raymond Hopkins, professor of political
science, was the main force behind the Ghana
program. On a research visit to the University
of Ghana in 1989, Hopkins discussed the

possibilities of a foreign exchange program
with Vice-Chancellor Akilagpa Sawyerr of
the university, whose daughter, Ayodelle
Sawyerr '9l, was a Swarthmore student. A
temporary agreement was soon reached, and
the first students left for Ghana in the fall of
1990. In spring of 1993, a final agreement
was signed when Piker hosted a senior faculty member from the University for a week.
The Universidad de la Frontera program
was created mainly through the efforts of
Braulio Munsz, professor of sociology/anthropology. He had been invited on several
occasions to give talks at the university, whose
press had previously published his work in
Spanish. Munoz took a particular interest in

the university because of its proximity to The
Institute for Indian Affairs, and also because
many Muchupa Indians lived there.
Preliminary discussions on a possible foreign study program began around three years
ago, and were finalized by a visit by Munoz
and Piker to the university last April. Right
now, Professor Reginaldo ZuritaChavezfrom
the university is at Swarthmore for a week to
talk to prospective exchange students. He is
also meeting withfaculty members specializing in Latin-American studies and will sit in
on classes related to the subject. According to
Munoz, the first students will probably be

Public Safety Nabs
Suspected Flasher
By Tony

Sturm

On Saturday, a man was arrested in connection with the indecent exposures on campus earlierthis month. The suspect was picked
up between Sharpies Dining Hall and the
pedestrian tunnel under the railroad tracks
around 6:00 p.m. Saturday evening.
According to Director of Public Safety
Owen Redgrave, "One of the victims [of the
indecent exposure] spotted the suspect whom
we were looking for, and had a friend keep
him in sight while she called Public Safety,"
who promptly arrested him.
The suspect, a Wallingford resident, has
been charged with a number of crimes, including indecent exposure, open lewdness,
disorderly conduct, and defiant trespassing.

The student who identified him was one of
two students who was in the Nautilus room of
the Field House on September 14, when a
man exposed himself to them. "She pretty
much IDed him" while he was walking on
campus a week later, said Redgrave.
Currently, Public Safety is trying to get in
touch with the victims of similar crimes over
the past year to see if this may be the man who
accosted them.
In January and February, exposures were
reported inside McCabe library, near Sharpies, and at the intersection of Field House
Lane and Sharpies Drive.
The alleged flasher was arraigned at the
Media District Justice Court. He was released on his own recognizance and is awaiting a preliminary hearing.

Two New Concentrations Added
Latin American Studies

and Francophone Studies
added to the curriculum
By

David King

Last spring, the faculty and the Curriculum
Committee added Francophone Studies and
Latin American Studies to Swarthmore's
curriculum, making them the College's two
newest concentrations. As with all concentrations, they were approved for a five-year
period, after which they will get another
review which will determine whether they
will be continued. Finally approved after a
great deal of planning and collaboration, the
concentrations have been received enthusiastically by both faculty and students alike.
"As I see it, the Francophone Studies and
Latin AmericanStudies Concentrations arose
out of an exciting convergence of three factors: a) strong faculty and student interest; b)
an increasingly internationalist world which
makes critical American understanding of,

and relations with, Africa, the Caribbean and
Latin America; and, c) an emerging intellectual world within which study of the experiences, traditions, accomplishments, and socioeconomic conditions of a broader range of
humanity has taken its rightful, prominent
place," explained President Al Bloom.
"We wanted some kind of trans-cultural
program that would be interdisciplinary,"
said Brigitte Lane, associate professor of
French (presently on leave) the driving force
behind the creation of Francophone Studies.
She believes that someday, we will all be in
an international community, and she hopes
this program will "open up the world, give
students a chance to look outside."
According to Lane, Francophone Studies
has been in the making for three years and has
a core of over 65 courses. It will follow
various trends in the modern world and give
students an international approach to their
studies, as well as providing them with a
second area of expertise. Furthermore, while
students don't have to be fluent in French,
they are strongly encouraged to study abroad
in a French-speaking country and gain expe-

rience in "Francophonie," or the "Frenchspeaking world."
The concentration will not officially begin
until next year, but two students presently in
the History Department are already enrolled.
"[Latin American Studies] is a result of
many faculty meetings over the course of 15
years...and a lot of student interest," said
JohnJ. Hassett, professor ofSpanish. "We're
hopeful that students will be intrigued by this
new concentration."
Latin American Studies, unlike
Francophone Studies, will require at least a
semester of study abroad, as well as participation in a "mini-course" taught jointly in
Spanish or Portuguese by a member of the
Swarthmore faculty and a visiting scholar
fromLatin America (the College is expecting
a professor from El Salvador to come teach
next semester). Students do not have to be
fluent in the language, but, according to
Hassett, they should be able to read material
that hasn't been translated and have a "specific level of linguistic ability." In addition,

Recycling Changes Provoke Response
By

Dan Green

By now you've probably noticed the lack
of recycling bins in Parrish Hall and the
academic buildings. This is just one result of
the major changes in the recycling program
decreed by Physical Plant.
According to Kate Schneider '9B, one of
the students who helped organize the recycling program last year, their decisions mean
that the College is "moving away from an
environmentally responsible policy."
Previously, students organized the recycling program. Volunteers in each dorm set
out bins in each hall and readied them for
weekly pickup by paid student workers.
$6,000 a year was budgeted for students to
pick up recyclables at each dorm and academic building on campus, sort them the
recyclables, and drop them in dumpsters behind DuPont. Students also composted food
waste from Sharpies.
According to Jessica Howington '9B, one
of the recycling coordinators, Physical Plant

Student Mentors

Senior Class

Officers

By Bryan

Chosen

A drop-in Study Skills Center has
been established in McCabe Library
for three evenings every week. The
Center will be open between 8 p.m.
and 11 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday,
and Thursday in Room 3, level 3 of
McCabe. Student Academic Mentors
will be available to offer assistance
on study and research strategies. The
Center will provide tips on studying
efficiently, reading withretention and
doing research projects. In addition
to peer support, the program hopes to
build an enhanced sense of community.
The Student Academic Mentor program began this year in an effort to
assist freshmen with learning the
ropes of the College and to identify
the resources that will improve their
academic and social lives. Each arriving frosh received an application
to sign up for the program. Fifteen
upperclass SAMs received training
and were matched to three first-years.
A growing wait list has developed as
more frosh have heard about the program through friends and acquain-

By a margin of 127 to 113, seniors elected the slate of Vittorio

Agnesi, Brenda Arellano, Wendy Cadge, Tony Cheesebrough,
Catherine Chomat, Jodi Furr, Jon Githens-Mazer, Duleesha
Kulasooriya, David Lischer, Becca Neff, and Amber Thompson to be
their class officers.
The elected group said, “We’re honored to have been given the
privilege ofrepresenting the Class of 1997 as seniorclass officers, and
we’re very anxious to begin planning for senior class events and
commencement.”
While they have not yet decided what type of event they will
organize first, they are considering a campfire on the Saturday night
of Homecoming weekend and a cocktail gala at the Art Museum. The
group mentioned the following as possible events for later in the year:
“a trip to Six Flags; renting a club in Philly for a night; a trip to either
the Yeungling or Dock St. breweries; a barbecue; a trip to New York
City for Broadway shows; Phillies opening day; a campout bash in the
Crum; a Senior ‘Drink Off; the Beach/Atlantic City; ‘Yard Sale’ to
underclassmen; a ski trip; and a Party on Ice night.”
While they have not yet received manyresponses from the questionnaire they distributed before the election, the group is “still very much
interested in receiving input and feedback from the senior class at
large throughout the year. They will have a bulletin board in Parrish
to solicit suggestions, and they invite other members of the Class of
1997 to join planning committees for Commencement, parties, and
fundraising.

Some Leads in Backpack Thefts

At the drop-in center, mentors will

The Department of Public Safety, in cooperation with Swarthmore
borough police, continued this week to investigate the backpack thefts
of September 16 and 19. Owen Redgrave, director of Public Safety,
said, “we have had a couple of students supply us with some leads.”
The leads suggest that the thefts were performed by an individual
rather than a group and by “someone older than typical student age.”
Redgrave would not reveal information regarding the physical descriptions of any suspects at this point in the investigation. Public
Safety has also increased its patrolling in order to prevent further
incidents.

WRC Elects Board Members
The Women’s Resource Center recently elected six new board

’99, Casey Cohn ’99, SueJeanneKoh ’97, Emily Shartin ’9B, Deborah
Stein ’99, and Laura Starita ’97.
The new WRC board had its first meeting Wednesday night, during
which members discussed plans for the ’96-’97 year, including
making the WRC a more prominent safe space on campus and
publishing a women’s newsletter.
Said Kruks-Wisner, “This is such an important year for the WRC,
and we couldn’t be happier with the group of women who were
elected.” Keep an eye on the WRC board space in Parrish for notices
about upcoming events.

which includes eliminating all roadways passing through campus
and replacing Parrish's front walkway. The original concrete
strips around the circle area were apparently improperly
installed and are being replaced. The resulting closure of the
circle has led to problems with College deliveries and the offcampus shuttle, which now leaves from the west side of Parrish.
Since the circle's closing, two accidents have occurred involving

Students Top Faculty in College Bowl
The annual College Bowl showdown between students and faculty
members took place in Kirby on Tuesday. In a tenacious battle, the
students once again triumphed by a score of 595 to 330. Ed Cohn ’99,
JeffLockman ’9B, Otavia Propper ’OO, and John Shainin ’OO represented the student team; on the faculty and staff side were Professor
Tom Blackburn of the English Department, Assistant Professor Tim
Burke of History, Assistant Professor Paul Rablen of Chemistry, and
Associate Dean Bob Gross. Fred Bush ’9B moderated the match.
The faculty team graciously conceded defeat. Said Rablen, “The
students blew us away.” Blackburn declared himself “fundamentally
handicapped by my non-functioning buzzer and the swift digits of the
honorable student opposition,” but added, “I felt the faculty/dean team
earned a moral victory by preventing the students from doubling our
score.”
Mike Pan ’97 and Gena Merliss ’97 provided running commentary
on Pan’s dry-erase board, thus earning them a spot in College Bowl
lore. Said Pan, “College Bowl is a game ofintimidation. I looked into
Bob Gross’s eyes, and I saw fear.” Other audience members participated in an informal student-only match after the main event. The team
provided refreshments in between matches.
In addition to drumming up interest, the match provided an opportunity to play-test questions for the National Academic Quiz Tournament. College Bowl meets Wednesdays at 7:30 in Kohlberg 201.

Faculty and othersenior faculty members. The program has already been
approved by the Swarthmore Foreign Study Committee, and is currently awaiting ratification by the faculty and administration of the University of Tokyo. If everything turns
out as planned, the exchange will
start in spring. This will be the first
time that undergraduate foreign students have studied on campus on an
exchange basis.
Foreign study programs not only
broaden the horizons ofSwarthmore
students, but are a mutually-beneficial undertaking as well. Whenit was
first approached by Swarthmore, the
University of Ghana at the same time
was seeking some sort of "foreign
student enrichment," according to
Hopkins.
Academic exchange and collaboration at the faculty level can also
grow out of the foreign study programs. Muiioz is hoping that a faculty exchange will occur with the
Universidad de la Frontera in the
long run. Sharon Friedler, associate
professor of dance, will be visiting
the University ofGhana this spring to
do research on traditional dances of
the country.
Mark Lotto 'OO served as an interpreter during the interview with Prof.
Zurita Chavez.

Portuguese may be interspersed
throughout the courses. "The kind of
student we're looking for really has
to have a profound interest in the
region of the world known as Latin
America," Hassett adds.
Several seniors are spending time
in Latin America, and many other
students have already fulfilled some
of the requirements. Within the next
few weeks, students will begin to
officially enter the concentration.
Provost Jennie Keith expressed
eagerness and enthusiasm: "Concentrations are an important channel for
innovation in thecurriculum.... These
two concentrations are excellent examples of the enrichment this aspect
of the curriculum can provide for
students and faculty."
"It's about time," agreed Jennifer
Klein '9B, referring to the creation of
Latin American Studies. "[ln Latin
American countries], you can see all
the forces that have been at work
throughout the centuries," she added.
Frank Kuo-Hui Yu '97, former Student Representative to the CEP, shares
Klein's excitement. He believes concentrations serve as an opportunity
for a student to explore a topic through
a multi-disciplinary perspective, as
well as a way to facilitate new approaches into the curriculum and to

ago."
Dana Lehman '9B perhaps best
captures the sentiments of the Student Academic Mentors: "It feels
good to use my experiences at Swarthmore to help other people adjust.
This isn't an easy place to be. We all
need to help each other out."

Presidential debates
are about to begin;
Perot filing lawsuit
Weedman

To all of you who were wondering when to start paying attention
to the presidential election, the
candidates replied this week with
a resounding "not yet."
The first televised presidential
debate was originally scheduled
for this past Wednesday, but was
canceled due to interparty squabbling over debate times and formats. Bob Dole had wanted to
meet in a one-on-one forum with
a moderator, while President
Clinton preferred a more open
"town hall" format.
In addition, candidate Ross
Perot lodged an even more problematic complaint: after being
barred from the event because he
did not have a statistically realistic chance of being elected, he
filed a lawsuit against the bi-partisan Federal Election Commission this week. The Election
Committee's decision could only
be overturned if Dole were to reverse his position and agree with
Clinton on admitting Perot, which
is highly improbable.
So now, Clinton and Dole are
slated to go head-to-head in the
debates on live television October
6 and 16.Though they're still warring over which kind of podiums
will be used, the candidates are

also be providing time management
workshops in each dorm during the
next weeks.
The Student Academic Mentor program has already received positive
feedbackfrom incoming frosh as well
as their upperclass peeradvisors. Matt
Neal '9B explains, "My first-year students are doing just fine, but in case
there comes a week when that isn't
the case, they know they can come to
me for help with studying, scheduling, or justdealing in general. During
a recent alumni gathering, a fellow
from the Class of 1956 observed me

break down departmental boundaries.
However, Yu thinks there isn't any
guarantee of continuity throughout
the course of the concentration, and
pulling the pieces together really relies on the students' efforts alone.
Yu is also concerned about the
structure of new concentrations. He
questioned whether they would force
faculty to do extra work, as well as
decide between departmental duty
and their loyalty to the concentration—and possibly weaken departmental offerings.
Lane denied this, insisting that professors have enough time to dedicate
to both, without sacrificing either.
Hassett contended "that's always a
danger in any type of new program,
but that won't be the case in this
particular program." He said the department will offer no more courses
than they are able to, and any new
courses will replace the old ones.
Looking to the future, Bloom said,
"Students have asked if the door is
open to further concentrations. The
faculty has discussed this issue carefully, and procedures are in place
both for proposing new concentrations and for reviewing existing ones
every five years. However...with a
faculty ofapproximately 160, the College can only take on a certain number of programs without compromising the excellence of what we offer."

recently.
Clinton, for instance, seems to
be faring better than ever with
these traditional Republican issues. Last week, he became the
first Democrat ever to be endorsed
by the Fraternal Order of Police.
According to a recent poll in
The New York Times, 45 percent
ofAmericans thinkClinton would
do a better job at reducing crime,
while only 34 percent think Dole
would.But Dole still seems to see
crime as a weak issue for the
Democrats. Last week, he began
an anti-drug campaign. His slogan, much to Nike's chagrin, was
"Just Don't Do It."
Going into the debates, Clinton
leads Dole by 53 percent to 34
percent in the polls. Dole conceivably could still have a shot if
he manages to shine in his de-

fense of the issues at the debates,
but it will take some brilliant
maneuvering on his part.
One thing is sure: the floor is
now theirs alone. Perot is now
officially the least popular politician in America, one percentage
point less popular than Newt
Gingrich. There will be only two
newsworthy candidates this fall,
and, if all goes well, they will
meet to slug it out one-on-one in
a few short weeks.

Recycling
{Continued from page 1}
With student labor costs constant,
there is no significant savings to offset the time Support Services will
spend until November.
The second concern is the placement of additional dumpsters near
residence halls. Jabco has confirmed
that those students now awakened
twice weekly by trash collection can
anticipate four earlymornings a week.
Similarly, the elimination of
composting, which students hoped to
expand this year, makes evident the
lack of communication between
Physical Plant and the student recycling coordinators, according to

Schneider.
Furthermore, the student recycling
coordinators worry that the vast ma-

jority of glass bottles which are taken
from Tarble every weekday morning
are carried to classrooms and, in the
absence of recycling containers, simply thrown away. According toLinda
McDougal, Director of Dining Services, students carry "approximately
550 glass bottles" out of Tarble every
weekday morning. Since there is no
recycling in the academic areas, this
means that, at least until November,
most glass on campus will not be
recycled.

The true value of intercollegiate sports.
Ideally, intercollegiate sports at an academically challenging institution
like Swarthmore provide students a healthy outlet from social pressure and
the rigors of study. Stress relief is essential to emotional well-being in an
environment where 40 hours a week describes not only future job expectations but present reading loads. Sports can fill the gaping physiological void
created by cramming for tests and taking so much caffeine our hands can’t
maneuver a pen well enough to form visible letters. But since varsity teams
demand as much time per week of their athletes as average classes do, they
diminish this potential balancing effect, producing additional stress that
student-athletes must juggle with their studies.
Proponents of the serious tone of Swarthmore athletics can argue that
because there are no scholarships at the Division 111 level, our athletes’ choice
to participate is grounded in free will. This argument falters whenrecruitment
is taken into consideration. Students who establish their first contact with an
institution through a coach often feel obligated to play once they arrive. The
student-athlete’s perception ofcampus life and classes is filtered through the
coach and the athletes he or she stays with during the initial visit.
Even if we place less stress on the pressures applied by coach and fellow
athlete and agree that the choice to participate in a sport rests on individual
students, recruitment raises important questions of institutional priorities. As
Swarthmore struggles to balance its budget while providing strong financial
aid, state-of-the-art facilities, and top-notch teaching to a diverse student
body, the role of sports at Swarthmore must come under the microscope.
Anyone who has spoken with a student who has been heavily recruited to
play sports at Swarthmore understands the amount ofeffort and money spent
to attract talentedathletes. Postage costs, long-distance phone bills, and home
visits exemplify a pattern of unnecessary expenditures. Unnecessary, that is,
if we believe attracting socially conscious and academically talented students
should take precedence over fielding successful teams.
While it is counterproductive to gloat about our number one ranking, we
shouldremember whatthe award signifies. Number ones of a different nature
are awarded to Miami and Penn State. If we are trying to catch up in the
national rankings or send a series of graduates into the National Basketball
Association and the NationalFootball League, heavy athletic spending might
be sensible.
Of course, Swarthmore spends nowhere near the amount allocated by these
athletic superpowers. But if our goal is to send enlightened and talented
individuals into the world, rather than produce the next Michael Jordan, we
shouldre-envision the role of athletics on this campus.
Athletics should never dominate academics here at Swarthmore; sports
should be secondary, academics primary. We do not propose to eliminate
organized sports at Swarthmore. Sound alternatives would be longer intramural seasons or teams composed of walk-ons with schedules and commitments
dictated by team members rather than coaches. Perhaps then sport would
embody its cathartic potential and the unnecessary pretense of seriousness
would not weigh upon student-athletes’ consciences.

Get thee to

a ballot box.

Have you registered to vote yet? Yes, we know, you forgot. Well, enough
already. Get yourself to your very friendly dorm representative, or drop by the
office of Registrar Martin Warner. Pick up a voter registration form, fill it out,
and mail it. The whole process will take no more than half an hour. You can’t
even read 50 pages of Hobbes’ Leviathan in that amount of time, you spend
more time eating dinner in Sharpies with your friends, and watching “ER”
takes an entire hour.
In classes, we have grand intellectual debates about government and how
we believe it should operate. Swarthmore offers classes in American politics,
political theory, and public policy. We dive into the battle to learn and
understand why the world runs the way it does. We drown in the myriad of
volunteer programs established to help others. We race to hear guest lecturers
such as Nobel Laureate Oscar Arias Sanchez. We also set ourselves up as
hypocrites as we philosophize, studying at the Kremlin on the Crum and not
voting.
People often remark that they have forgotten to vote. There is nothing more
frustrating to us than hearing these selfsame people express critical opinions
about the government. A deliberatechoice not to vote is one thing; forgetting
is entirely another. Forgetting to register, forgetting to send away for an
absentee ballot, forgetting to vote for a president of the United States is not
a choice. And people who aren’t doing their part as citizens in a democracy
to make choices about the government shouldn’t be surprised when the
government does things they don’t like.
This brings us to our next point: when you register, don’t forget to apply for
an absentee ballot—just fill in the little box at the bottom of the registration
form. And if you are already registered, we congratulate you and humbly ask
you to fulfill the rest of your civic duty; please vote. Call the authorities in your
hometown and request an absentee ballot. Just because you are away from
home does not mean you have an excuse.
October 7 is the last day you can register. On your mark, get set, go.. .we’ll
see you at the Registrar’s office.

Letter to the Editor
Dean Responds to Parents’ Storage Concerns
Dear Parents,
I am writing in response to your
recent letter to President Bloom.
First let me say that I am very sorry
to hear that your daughter's stereo
was taken. It is indeed a hard loss and
I certainly understand your anger.
The College does not carry insurance that protects private property,
and that is why each year in my summer mailing to continuing students, I
strongly encourage students to purchase property insurance or to be sure
that it is covered through their parents' household insurance. In that
mailing we also include a brochure
from a vendor of such insurance. If I
might offer myself as an example, I
have several pieces of my personal
art in my office and I insure it through
my household insurance.
You raise a concern about the adequacy of summer storage in connection to the summer housing offered
by theCollege. The College is not in
academic session during the summer
months. In fact, after graduation many
staff in the Dean's Office are not
employed during the summer, leaving us unable to offer the same services to students and their families as
during the school year.
Those of us who are in the Dean's
Office during the summer use that
time in several ways: completing unfinished work from the academic year
before, planning for the next academic year, preparing for the training
of resident advisors (RAs) and the
orientation programs for new students, attending to our professional
development, and taking vacation. In
fact, the office that oversees the summer housing that is available to students is the Facilities and Services
Office, not the Dean's Office. Except
for sending out several mailings to
students and responding to phone calls
and mail from students and their families, we do not provide direct services
to students during the summer.
Not very long ago the College began to provide summer housing for
students working on campus as a service to students and their employers.
In addition, we provide housing for
those international students who cannot afford to go home. For the most
part, our students and their parents
report that summer housing is very
successful and helpful. However, because we house families during graduation festivities, house alumni during
Alumni Weekend, prepare our housing stock for the coming academic
year and, just before classes begin,
train RAs and orient new students,
the College is not able to provide
housing for all time periods during
the summer.
During the summer our student storage facilities are filled to the brim.
Possible solutions to the questions
you raise about storage during the
transitional periods of the summer
include asking thestudent's employer
to store a couple of valuable items;
working out something with a fellow
student; not having all of the student's

belongings accessible year-round; or
finding a different summer housing
option that better fits the student’s
needs. The College offers the summer housing option to students in the
best way that it can but we understand
that it might not meet the summer
housing needs of all of our students.
Three years ago we opened high
security storage for student use over
breaks or during the summer. The way
we are able to maintainthat security is
to have limitedaccess so that the room
is off the general key system and is
staffed by members of Public Safety.
Students and their parents report that
this program is highly successful. It
has also reduced the theft of student
belongings dramatically. We only allow each student to put four items into
the high security storage space because it is limited in size.
This special storage space has also
helped reduce some demand for the
regular residence hall storage for it
holds bicycles and refrigerators as
well as stereos and computers. When
the regular residence hall storage was
built, it was designed at a timebefore
students brought so many things to
school like bicycles, televisions,
VCRs, microwaves, refrigerators, additional furniture and rugs. The demand for summer storage grows as
students bring more and more belongings from home that they prefer
to leave here.
Student storage areas have also become repositories for abandoned studentbelongings. Occasionally the storage rooms are cleaned by the staff
members in Physical Plant, but they
havelimited availability for such tasks
as they are very busy responding to the
thousands of work orders that come to
them for repairs and new projects.
A better solution to this overcrowding in storage might best come from
a student initiative, especially ifthey
begin by considering several of your
suggestions. At Swarthmore we have
a strong tradition of students acting
on their own behalf. We are available
to provide resources and consultation but our students often implement
their own ideas. For example, the
student orientation committee efficiently moves new students into their
rooms so there is less of a logjam of
cars trying to access the buildings on
the day students move in. Our students
have created a recycling program on
campus that would be the envy of
many college and university campuses.
I believe that students have the
ability and, through Student Council,
the resources to address this problem. The College can help support
such efforts by providing improved
shelving or helping to organize the
designated storerooms. Members of
my staff will consult with others at
the College to see what else might be
done in support of their efforts.
Thank you very much for writing.
If you have more questions, I would
be happy to respond to them. I am
also sending a copy ofmy response to
your letter, recently published in The
Phoenix, to our student newspaper in
the hope that it will stir students to
think about what they might do to
better monitor their storage space.
Perhaps one of them might take a
leadership role with Student Council
in addressing this effort.
Sincerely,
Ngina Lythcott

IEURAILPASSES ISSUED ON-THE-SPOT!

Crucial Time for Political Alternatives
By

Vincent Jones

Currently both major political parties devote a substantial portion of
their energies to gaining the votes
and meeting the needs ofthose Americans who live a middle class lifestyle
and share a certain skin tone. President Clinton's "New Democrat"
rhetoric, supported by the moderate
Democratic Leadership Council, has
sought to win the political and financial support of this group. The Republican party, on the other hand, has
practically defined its existence by
its steadfast support of those policies
and issues which tend to benefit individuals (and corporations) enjoying
a rather comfortable lifestyle.
Such party practices can be argued
to have been beneficial to the country
in the past, as reflected by its status
throughout the world as an economic
powerhouse. However, recent demographic transformations, subsequent
cultural changes and nearly non-ex-

istent response from either party has
created a potential crisis in our nation, tantamount to the conditions
that created the Civil War and the
protests of the 50s, 60s, and 70s.
The America of the next century
will consist mostly of people whose
interests do not necessarily conform
to those ofwhite, middle-class Americans. Several demographers have predicted that no racial or ethnic group
will comprise a majority of the population. Instead, our nation will be a
majority of minorities. Although this
change will not occur on a national
scale for a few more decades, several
states have already witnessed such a
change. For example, Latinos comprise a substantial portion ofthe population of the state of California and
will most likely be a majority in the
near future.
Despite such political realities, both
major parties (and most minor parties) neglect, ignore or belittle the
importance of the interests of groups

outside of the so-called mainstream
of America the middle class. The
reluctance of either major party's
presidential candidate to directly address the needs of Blacks, Latinos,
Asian-Americans and lower-class
whites reflects their neglect of these
groups in favor of white middle- and
upper-class persons.
Moreover, voters have already expressed their frustration with the Republican-Democratic hegemony by
their support of Ross Perot and with
efforts to encourage both Bill Bradley and Colin Powell to run for office.
It seems to me that the conditions are
ripe for the beginnings of another
major party to displace one or both of
the current majorparties. Both Democrats and Republicans should study
the conditions which lead to the emergence of the Republican party and be
aware of the many parallels which
can be drawn to today's political cli—

mate.

On the other hand, any activist who

has lost faith in the current offerings
in most campaigns and wishes to bring
a new alternative to the table should
start organizing now. More importantly, do not simply reinvent the
wheel and fashion a new party within
the paradigm and/or praxis of either
current party. Instead, build a party
which advocates a new vision for
America, whichmelds withthe newly
forming heart, body and soul of
America and growing interdependence ofall people in the global com-

munity.
Both major parties will have an

extremely difficult time preventing
their eventual downfall and various
barriers will hinder the development
of new political alternatives. However, if it's meant to be, then it's
meant to be. In any case, Americans
should not fear the uncertainty of the
nextmillennium because change cannot be avoided and often yields many
new opportunities, as well as problems.

DOMA: Governmentally Sanctioned Intolerance
By

Andrew

Bryce

It was on the front page of The
Phoenix. In big, bold letters it shot
out of the page at me and brought me
to a revelation which hounds me every day: what a sick, sere wed-up
world we are living in. The headline
read, "Senate Acts Against Gays."
I read about the Senate's decision,
praying with every word that I had
misread the article, that somewhere I
would find a sentence or a paragraph
or a word that would refute what I
knew was the truth— America has
told its people that it simply does not
like homosexuals.
To quote from the issue, "The [bill]
precludes federal recognition ofsamesex marriages and allows states not to
recognize gay marriages." This is
euphemistically called the Defense
of Marriage Act. What is being defended? How is marriage protected
by this bill? Answer that, and I will
concede that this is a worthy bill.
Before you answer, listen. The
whole idea of marriage, the whole

point, is that twc people who love
each otherbe able to spend theirlives
with each other. What is the difference if these people are two men or
two women instead of a man and a
woman? They love each other; they
want to spend their lives together;
they are human beings. For god's
sake, how is this not marriage? In
what way does this bill protect the
very thing that it sets out to prevent?
What upsets me most about this is
the fact that under the headline, the
article continued to say that the votes
"provoke a variety ofresponses from
Swarthmore students." To me, there
can only be one response to this bill,
and that is the simple fact that it is
wrong. It was noted in support of this
bill that the "underlying message" is
a positive one, that it says that the
Federal Government is not going to
give its "stamp of approval" to lesbian and gay unions.
Again, I ask you—why should it
not? What is so horrible about gay
marriages that they shouldbe frowned
upon by our nation's government by

a vote of 85 to 14?
If you think that homosexuals will

eventually morally destroy America,
I entreat you to look to the past. The
only society to fully accept homosexuality was ancient Athens, which
is perhaps one of the greatest civilizations in history. The minute you
look at gay people as a problem, the
minute you look at them as the "moral
decay of America," is the minute that
you start to cheapen the American
ideal of toleranceand equality. I don't
understand how people can think that
gays are a problem and that you have
to "defend" the pact of marriage from
them. Why are they morally wrong?
Because it's in the Bible? Sorry, I
can't accept that. We live in America,
and America is supposed to hold
firmly to its creed offreedom of religion. Because they freak you out?
Sorry, but Pat Buchanan freaks me
out; I doubt many bills will be passed
to defend us from him. Because they
are just...wrong? Sorry, but that just
doesn't work because there is nothing to work for it.

Imagine what it is like to be gay.
There are many people on campus
that can tell you about it, and many
people who have told me about it, but
it is still difficult for heterosexuals to
conceive of it.
Imagine what it is like to avoid
your lover's gaze lest you be hated;
imagine what it is like to not be able
to hold your lover's hand lest you be
reviled. The greater moral sin is not
being gay, but the shunning of gay
people. The crime is not homosexuality, but hatred.
Come on, people! Listen to your
own humanity! Our existence should
not be based on intolerance, distrust,
and hatred, but on love. The whole
point of America is that the government takes this love and gives it back
to the people in its ultimate display of
freedom. Why takethis freedom away
because you do not care for what
some people do with it? To all people
who support this bill based on your
distaste with homosexuality, ask
yourself one question. What if you
were gay?

Platforms for SC-Curriculum Committee
Student Council asked candidates, "Beyond your role on Curriculum Committee, what role will you play in the Council's general
work?" In addition, The Phoenix gave candidates an opportunity to
discuss curricular improvements involving either multiculturalism or
communication.

Lars Jan 'OO
Phoenix Question 2: Most importantly, Council members must begin
to take their roles beyond their
weekly meetings and other commitments by integrating Council affairs
into their daily conversations with
others. In such informal settings,
true opinions are likely to be drawn
out, and Council members will then
possess a body of student views from
which they may form their own opinions.
Secondly, in a more tangible sense,
Student Council could begin small,
random surveys of the student body
on Council issues. E-mail, mailboxes, or door-to-door surveying
could help towards this end. Some
would say that students would be
unresponsive in replying, or would
appear rather indifferent when approached personally. It is my feeling, however, that not only would
the community respond positively
to such inquiries on substantive,
well-presented issues, but that even
when confronted with apathetic students, Council must nonetheless take
theresponsibility to raise their awareness and draw out their voice. The
term "apathy" is currently used to
write off too many people. Many
more students may be incorporated
into Council discourse, only Council must take a greater responsibility
in seeking these voices out.
SC Question: I have observed
from weekly meetings that Council
occasionally has difficulties with

communication. Personal issues
seem to color "professional" opinion and discourse, to the point where
some individuals' opinions are invalidated primarily due to personal
biases held against them; resulting
tension often impedes progress and
efficiency, and such a setting is of-

intimidating or unproductive for
guests wishing to voice an opinion
or simply observe. I believe several
of my personal attributes would lend
to making Council more productive
and approachable.
Fundamentally, I value listening
and compromise above all else. This
is not to say that I do not hold my
convictions quite strongly, but that I
always attempt to understand the
ten

other's viewpoint in any given discussion.
Also, having been a teacher (of an
AIDS Seminar for high school students) this summer, I am greatly
aware of group dynamics. I have
experience with facilitation and conflict-resolution techniques, and find
the inclusion of all voices and opinions the most important factor in
seeking settlement.
I have also observed thatCouncil
members occasionally seem unprepared to discuss certain policy issues, given that they have not done
the appropriate fact-finding and legwork. Here, again, I feel I may help.
I am inclined to put extracurricular
interests ahead of my school work.
I am fully willing to spend what
may seem to be an inordinate
amount of time making my position
and the Council stronger and more
informed.
Aside from my concern with the
general workings of Council, I also
would bring my philosophical bias
concerning the benefits and importance of social service to the position. This 'bias' may be most easily
revealed in that I see wrongs and
inconsistencies within our society
and attempt to act upon them. By the
same token, I hope to bring my critical eye and sense of fairness to the
Swarthmore campus, where I also
believe much can be improved.
I value all opinions, work well in
group settings and am quite industrious. The foundation for most of
my beliefs lies in my conviction for
social service. Such qualities, I believe, are to be desired in a Council
member, and if I am not to provide
them, I hope that at least someone
will. I, of course, would like to win.
But I say sincerely that I am more
concerned that theCurriculum Committee seat be filled by the most
capable candidate, than by myself.
As a final note, I would like to point
out that Council, having twelve seats,
only has two femalerepresentatives.
I feel that this dynamic is problematic, and that this low proportion of
female representation should be
given some extra attention. Vote
Lars... Thank you.

Rachel Henighan '97
SC Question: I understand the
role of Student Council to be the
facilitation of communication between administrationand students by
creating a space for dialogue, both
directly by planning events where
students and administration can come
together and through SC members'
roles as representatives of the student
body. The work of the Student Council, then, should be the persistent creation of space and time for the exchange of ideas.
This would be my priority ifI were
elected to Student Council. There are
many groups active on campus now
with strong ideas about the future of
Swarthmore and concrete ways to
make changes. I do not advocate turning Student Council into a lobbying
voice forcampus organizations. However, I feel that as the formal student
liaison between the student body and
the administration, Student Council
has a responsibility to work with and
listen to groups with something to
say.
In the past year student interest in
the five "important" College committees has increased, and as I have
watched that happen I have grown
concernedabout the process by which
those selections are made. Specifically, decisions regarding all appointed positions are made by members of Student Council, while all
elected members ofCollege committees are also members of Student

Council.
While I have no doubt that specific
selections are objective and fair, the
process itself deserves some consideration. Couldit be more democratic?
Could some people outside of Student Council be included in decisions
about appointments? This is a process I would like to reevaluate.
I am a senior, and in many ways it
is a strange time to run for Student
Council. Education has been one of
my main academic interests here at
Swarthmore, and over the years I
have reflected a lot on what goes on
here, both institutionally and pedagogically.
By being a member of the Curriculum Committee, I feel I could offer
my perspective on a subject that I
know something about academically,
but also personally through six se-

here.
Phoenix Question 1: One thing

mesters

that I hope has come out of the discussions about multiculturalism in

the past year is that there are processes and structural aspects to embracing a multicultural agenda— becoming multicultural is not simply a
matter of facts, books, or perspectives, though those are also important. This is where my commitment
to multiculturalism and the work of
the Student Council could coincide.
Currently Student Council is a very
traditional and hierarchical organization and I think that is reflected in
how itis perceived by students. If SC
were to consider alternative approaches to organization and communication, there is the potential for
it to become more effective.
For example, thereare several ways
to solicit communication. One is by
saying to the student body, "Here we
are, please come and tell us what you
need or are concerned about." This
way is perfectly acceptable, but has
proved less than successful in the
past.
One alternative would be to recruit
communication actively: by sending
representatives to the meetings of
other groups (by permission, of
course) in order to listen to their concerns, obtaining the copies of minutes from meetings, or actively participating in inter-club dialogue.

Another example is the reconsideration of the methods by which
people are appointed to College committees, in order to make those positions more accessible to people who
are not already empowered on this
campus.
As a member of the Curriculum
Committee I would support the same
structural commitments to a
"multicultural" institution. Because
the major task for the curriculum
committee this semester will be examining the changes made in the
Honors Program in an effort to make
the new system as effective as possible, I am unsure how my commitment to multicultural content or curriculum would be important to those
considerations.
As a student who has gone through
S warthmore in the middle of the transition from the old to the new honors
systems, I have both reflected personally on the program as far as its
usefulness to me and seen community-wide reactions and frustrations.
As an observer to these changes I
would like to have to opportunity to
share those reflections with the faculty and administration.

Swarthmore History...

Her
Future
And Her
Father

Hello

and welcome to another thrilling
episode of Katie Menzer's "This Is

(but doesn't have to be) Your Life!"
brought to you by Katie's Dad and The Society for the Prevention ofHumanities Majors.
We begin tonight's show in the Swarthmore mail room. After beating two freshmen
within inches of their wretched little lives
because they were not following proper mail
room etiquette (i.e. moving out of the mail
room before perusing their postal goodies,)
she opens her box and draws out a letter
addressed from her dad. Then, after leaving
the mail room so that other poor upperclassmen will also be able to beat the freshmen,
she opens her dad's letter. A strange feeling
of deja vu permeates her very soul as she pulls
from the envelope a note from Dad and a
newspaper clipping from The New York Times.
She quickly scans the article, which turns out
to be an obituary for some dead doctor dude
specializing in schistosomiasis and other fun
tropical diseases, and notices a paragraph of
the clipping which has been highlighted with
a bright, fluorescent pink marker. This section says that this dead guy, before attending
Harvard Medical School, went to Harvard as
an undergraduate and majored in history and
literature.
In the note accompanying this fascinating
article, Ms. Menzer' s Dad writes, "DearKatie.
Look at this guy's undergraduate major in
college. Love, Dad." Yes, that's whatit says.
However, as Katie knows, her dadintends for
her to read between the lines of this onesentence note. In actuality, this note says,
"Dear Pathetic Spawn. Look at this guy's
undergraduate major in college. It's almost
as worthless as yours. But hey, he still wentto
medical school. All is not yet lost. You're still
young. Sure, you're going 85 mph down the
highway to hell, but look up ahead! There's
one exit ramp left! Merge to the right, Child!
Merge to the right!"
Well, Dad, I'm afraid the offramp is closed
due to irreparable structural damage, and I'm
not going to be able to exit here. They have all
these big orange cones up and eight construction guys are standing around watching another guy eat a sandwich, so I don't think
they're going to be donebefore I pass theexit.
Plus, there are squashed dead squirrel guts in
the right lane and I don't want to get rotting
vermin innards on my car.
So, I guess my humanities major is as
inevitable as meeting every cute guy on your
hall as you exit the shower wearing a giant,
frumpy, polka-dotted bathrobe. And as you
try to gracefully brush back the tangled mats
ofhair that drip water down your make-upless, pimple-covered face, everyone else
comes out of their rooms to see what they
thought was Hipper the dolphin doing the
Macarena in a terrycloth robe on their hall,
but actually it was only you in your everstylish, yet very loud flip-flops. Of course,
yourResident Assistant is there, and he has to
make some snide comment about your hair.
And your next door neighbor is also there,
and as he tries to shout something to you
about your intrinsic beauty above the throbbing pulse of his inordinately loud Public
Enemy CD, all you can do is smile and clomp
into your room.
So, y'all can stop cowering and whimpering now, for I won'tbe coming at you with a
scalpel and a pair of tweezers any time soon.
That is, unless you want me to.

From the Depths of ML to the Silver Screen
By

Dave Mimno

The

sight of several large trailers block
ing the traffic circle outside Parrish
West brought a temporary "movie fever" to campus. Everyone had something to
say about it, from those who grumbled about
being kicked out of Sproul Observatory to
those who spent hours hanging around behind Tarble trying to catch a glimpse of
Matthew Broderick. But most people don't
know thatthis was not Swarthmore College's
first appearance on the silver screen.
As it turns out, the first scene of the movie
Blow Out (1981) was filmed in the women's
side of Mary Lyon basement. The movie was
directed by Brian DePalma and starred John
Travolta. On September 23,1980, The Phoenix reported that Robert Rothbard, unit coordinator for the film, "appeared at ML the first
week of September to take pictures. Explaining to Resident Assistant Clarke Bruno that
he had been searching all over the Philadelphia area for a particular type of dormitory,
he said he 'thought he had finally found what
he was looking for.'"At that point, it was still
unclear whether DePalma would actually
choose Swarthmore as his location.
DePalma, however, was impressed.
Rothbard was quoted as saying "he loves the
school; he thinks it's fantastic!" Filming was
scheduled to begin in October, pending the
signing of a few releases and the selection of
a star. The movie was at that time titled
Personal Effects. They apparently ran into
some delays. According to the January 23,
1981 edition of The Phoenix, the scene was
filmed over winter break.
In the movie, John Travolta plays a sound
engineer who works for a studio that produces B-grade horror movies. The scene in

Person Profile

Talking with Jeff Jabco about Plants and Plans
By

Gabriel Cumming and
Rachel

McKnight

It

appears that Swarthmore College didn't
think we had enough excitement in our
lives. In the morning, we run frantically
to class (having overslept after staying up all
night battling calculus), dodging people in
our way, gulping down bagels and orange
juice that we scramble for in Tarble, and we
discover that our usual route to Du Pont has
been torn up and is now a mud preserve. The
joy of construction. However, we students
are not the only ones inconvenienced by such happenings.
For the Scott Arboretum
specimens, heavy construction
has meant a move from one
side of campus to another to
avoid complete destruction
a consequence that no student
hopefully has to worry about.
In charge of this process is Jeff
Jabco, director ofgrounds and
assistant director of horticulture. Jabco talked with us recently about his work and
about the Scott Arboretum's '
role in the College.
Most of us feel that our connection to
horticultural side of the Collegeconsists only
of the plants on our windowsills, generously
given to us during Orientation. Some of us
may even feel that we don't have that, having
lost our plants to the cold winter months or

not." The Swarthmore campus is more than
the regular combination of "turf, buildings
and a couple of trees." Recently, the campus
has been officially accredited as a national
museum, containing "plants rather than pottery." Jabco explained that members of the
Arboretum Collections Committee analyze
the campus regularly, in order to determine
which areas need to be developed and re
worked.
For example, Jabco showed us blueprints
of a garden which he has designed for the side
of Kohlberg Hall. His intent is to create a

of several requests from theCollege, a part of
the garden will be high enough to be seen
from the faculty lounge windows behind the

should pay more attention to the landscaping
all over the campus.
The Arboretum is certainly nothing to disregard. "We like to think of ourselves as
having the best campus landscape in the
United States," Jabco asserted. Why are we

Swarthmore's Upward Bound Program
By

Although

Alla Brukman

never venture into the depths of
Parrish basement.it houses many
more interesting things than the laundry and
storage rooms. One of the offices found in the
basement is that of the Swarthmore College
Upward Bound program. Part of a national
venture, the Swarthmore chapter of the federally-funded program began in 1964. Governmental budget cuts have forced many colleges in the country to eliminate theprogram.
However, it stillexists at 600 sites throughout
the country, including Temple University
and the University of Pennsylvania, and has

about 44,000 participants.
The goal of Upward Bound is to prepare
potentially "at risk" high school students for
the demands of higher education. The participants in Swarthmore's Upward Bound are
mostly Chester students. During the school
year, Upward Bound provides counseling
and tutoring for the participants at theirhome
schools, with Swarthmore students acting as
tutors. The College contributes housing and
physical facilities for the residential summer
component of the program. Approximately
fifty high school students live on campus
during the summer, attending academic
classes and participating in extracurricular
activities. At times, Swarthmore professors

have taught the summer classes, which prepare the students for courses that they will
take during the fall semester.
Many alumni of Upward Bound return to
conduct the extracurricular activities. In an
art class taught by Raquel Dowty, students
use discarded objects to create art. Last summer, they used old 5-inch floppy disks to
make jewelry boxes. For performance at the
end of the summer, C. Kemal Nance '92
teaches students to choreograph an original
work, incorporating several elements of African dance, and the choir members learn
about pitch and tone in order to perform
songs. Upward Bound participants have also
contributed to the program's newspaper,
learned martial arts, and physical conditioning which would allow them to participate in
sports.
Upward Bound is a very worthwhile program, according to Nance, because it has a
history of turning out both outstanding academics and upstanding members of the community. It shows how far supposedly "at
risk" people can come when given a chance
to succeed.
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported on a
gathering of Upward Bound alumni last
spring. Upward Bound "changed my life and
my direction," Keith Reeves, an assistant
professor of public policy at the Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard Univer-

sity, told the Inquirer. "The roadfrom Chester
to Harvard led through Upward Bound."
Reeves grew up in the shadow of the William
Penn public housing development in Chester,
and joined the Swarthmore College Upward
Bound program in ninth grade.
The program gave him an academic boost,
he told the Inquirer, and steered him toward
Westtown School, a private school in Chester
County. He returned to Swarthmore as a college student.

blessed with this landscape?
The Scott who gave us the Scott Arboretum
was an alumnus, a horticulturalist, and a
Quaker. The first two explain the choice of
Swarthmore and the nature of the gift; the
third provides the motivation. In the egalitarian Quaker spirit, Scott wanted all things to
be made accessible to all people. When he
died, his wife set up an endowment to realize
her husband's dream of an arboretum without
gates or admission charge. Better yet, the
arboretum is actually lived in. "I like to think
that we have close to two thousand visitors
every day," Jeff says. Guess who these visitors are? True to its founder's wishes, the
Arboretum has a mission: to grow the best
plants for the Delaware Valley, and to educate the public.
How does Jabco fit into the mission? He is
a horticulturalist, he says, defining horticulture as "the science and art of growing plants."
As a scientist, he aids the plants; for example,
the woods must be culled of "exotic" species
to preserve the native species. As an artist, he
works for the people who experience the
grounds, sculpting an aesthetically pleasing
and diverse floral experience. Jabco's fascination with plants extends beyond the job: he
gardens as a hobby, and all of his "vacations
are looking at gardens."
According to Jabco, when something on

campus must be eradicated, the Arboretum is
careful to remember the environment: "We
do not like to use any chemical pesticide." In
fact, they are "founders of a group in integrated pest management," which seeks to
minimize the use of pesticides through an
awareness of insects' and plants' respective
life cycles, and through the use of "insecticidal soaps and oils."
We asked Jabco about the grass beside
Kohlberg, which is obviously dead; evidently
the victim in all of this is temporary turf,
eradicted in favor of "perennial bulbs." How
was the killing done? The school used an
"herbicide that's a salt," which is absorbed by
the plant and breaks down within a day,
leaving "no soil residue."
From all of his experience, Jabco knows
how to deal with bugs, chemicals, and construction machinery. Unfortunately, he is less
well-equipped against heedless vandalism.
Two weekends ago near the Olde Club, where
a late-night party was in progress, "two unusual sweetgums" were broken off and destroyed. So, a piece of advice for all of you
late-night revelers: stop to think before you
take out your passions on the nearest sapling.
Jabco and the Scott Arboretum have worked
incredibly hard to make us a nice home, and
it would be in all of our best interest to keep
it exactly that way.

Kate Bernstein '99, Jason Rothenberg '9B,
and Diana Hunt '99 were cast as extras,
mainly because they happened to be in the
right place at the right time.
It had been announced that the crew was
not going to be looking for any extras. But
according to Rothenberg, "the director didn't
think that the real extras they had hired looked
like college kids; they were all over thirty
years old." Rothenberg and Bernstein, being
among a few students doing special majors in
film, were being given a tour of the set (arranged for them by their advisor, Patricia
White, assistant professor of English literature), when the crew spotted them and asked
if they wanted to be in the movie.
Hunt was on a tour of the set along with
reporters from area publications; she had
joined the tour to take photographs. They
were watching a rehearsal of a scene when a
member of the crew looked in her direction
and asked her if she wanted to be in the
movie.

Rothenberg spoke with him briefly about the
new Michael J. Fox sitcom. (M.B. likes it.)
"We had the same sneakers so I think there
was a real unspoken bond," said Rothenberg.
Such glamour aside, the three have learned
first-hand just how tedious the movie business is: "It took 14 hours to film 20 seconds
of the film!" said Rothenberg, and the crew
was here for two days to film four minutes of
the movie.
This site was chosen for its proximity to
Manhattan (where the rest of the filming
takes place), because the Observatory is fairly
large, and because Swarthmore promised to
be 'accommodating' to the crew while they
were here.
Don't think that they didn't scratch our
backs in return, though—a Swarthmore Tshirt was given to the crew, who said that it
would be shown in the movie.

Arizona & Fargo Without Leaving Campus
By Emily Shartin

Sharing

&

what is currently one of
the hottest names in Holly
wood, Joel and Ethan Coen set
upon Swarthmore this weekend offering to take moviegoers away. Even
if thinking about an early vacation
hadn't originally made you think of
places like Minnesota or Arizona,
take our word for it that any escape to
the theater this weekend will be well
rewarded.
For years, the Coen brothers have
been startling movie audiences with
their work. What might be forgotten
while watching Raising Arizona is
that the Coens are usually acclaimed
for the style of horror, not comedy.
Still, Arizona is a film that keeps one
laughing until it hurts.
The film's two main characters
have been brought together by their
careers. Herbert I. McDunnough
(Nicholas Cage) is a misfitfrom society until he is smitten with his soonto-be wife Edwina (Holly Hunter) in
the Maricopa County Correctional
Facility in Tempe, Arizona. Edwina
is a twice decorated policewoman,
but Hi and Ed refuse to let their pasts
keep them apart.
They marry and move to suburban
Tempe; Hi forgets all about convenience stores and Ed makes plans to
start a family. But their new lives are
shattered with the discovery that
Edwina is infertile and they are inappropriate parents for adoption.

With nowhere to turn, Hi and Ed
determine to do what everyone else
was doing in the 1980s: they try to
steal a little piece of the American
Dream for their very own.
Even whentheir work is as humorous as it is in Raising Arizona, the
Coen brothers still bring a hint of fear
and anxiety into all their movies. The
movie hardly has a serious moment,
but even so, it's hard not to feel a bit
worried for the wee child Hi and Ed
kidnap. His parents, while loving and
laughable, seem a little unstitched.
Joel and Ethan Coen are respected
for being able to capture the characteristics of different regions of the
nation on film, but if this is the case
with Arizona, the American Southwest may well be a region best viewed
from a distance. Like Hi watering the
lawn in his sweatsocks and flip-flops,
everything existing in the film seems
ridiculously out of place. This works
to create both the films overall comedic effect and its underlying sense of
uneasiness.
Undeniably, the film's two truest
assets are its screenplay, written by
Ethan Coen, and the many excellent
performances of its cast members.
It's difficult for anyone to deny
Cage's skill, but even he is arguably
outshone in the film by Holly Hunter.
Both Cage and Hunter show themselves to be masters of the hilariously
frightening humor that characterizes
a Coen comedy.
Also of interest is Frances
McDormand in a minor role as Dot,

Edwina's best friend. McDormand,
who is married to Joel Coen, also
plays the lead in Forgo as a reticent,
Minnesotan sheriff. If anyone needs
to be convinced of the range of her
talent, they only need compare her in
the two roles. Indeed, after watching
her in Forgo, it is difficult to recognize McDormand as the same woman
who plays Dot.
Judging the comedy to be an earlier Coen work, however, is not as
difficult a task. The cleverness with
which humor and horror are made
into one leaves no questions about
the films quality or its origins.
Raising Arizona plays at 7:30 and
10 p.m. Friday night in the PAC Cinema

Fargo is the most recent addition
to the Coen brothers' quirky ceuvre,
and arguably one of the best. The film
is based on the more or less factual
story of JerryLundegaard (played by
ER's William H. Macy), an uptight
Minneapolis car salesman who is
quickly sinking deeper and deeper
into debt.
The only way he can think to disentangle himselffrom hisfinancial mess
is by cooking up an extraordinary
plan: he hires two lowlife criminals
(played by Peter Stormare and the
always brilliant Steve Buscemi) to
kidnap his wife Jean. Jerry then figures Jean's wealthy father Wade will
easily put up a million-dollar ransom
that Jerry can collect and split with
his co-conspirators.
Of course what Jerry doesn't count

on is everything going horribly awry
in an amazing series of darkly-comic
wrong turns. Desperately horrific
crimes are suddenly being committed all over Minnesota, and theCoens
send in the heavily pregnant and level-

headed policewoman Marge
Gunderson (played marvelously by
Frances McDormand) to get to the
bottom of things, which she eventually does.

Though named for the town in
North Dakota where Jerry first meets
his doomed partners-in-crime, Far go
is ultimately a parable of the Coens'
freezing, austere home state of Minnesota. It seems poignant, although it
perhaps is merely coincidental, that
this film comes at a time when the
crime-rate in the Minneapolis-St. Paul
area is in fact on the rise.
It seems the Coens were playing
with this dichotomy in their own
twisted way: they give us comically
over-the-top midwestern characters
with quasi-Swedishaccents and quiet
ways of life, but they imbue the serenity with encroaching violent undertones.
This may seem like a pessimistic
reading ofone's homeland; however,
the final scene of Fargo, in which
Marge lays peacefully in bed withher
husband after saving the day in Minneapolis, seems to suggest that no
matter how weird things get in Minnesota, everything will eventually go
back to normal.
Fargo plays at 7:30 and 10 p.m.
Saturday night in the PAC Cinema.

Bucknell Slams
Women Ruggers
By

Jen Philpott

Swarthmore women's rugby players had a rough game on Saturday
against Bucknell University, losing
by a score of 24-0. Swarthmore's
inexperienced team played as well as
could be expected against a Bucknell
squad which had already played two

games this season. Bucknell also has
a coach while Swarthmore does not.
On a more positive note,
Swarthmore demonstrated an ability
to adjust to another team's strategy
mid-game. Bucknell was able to lift
their jumper several feet off the
ground during line-outs, and
Swarthmore was struggling to defend against this tactic.
By the second half, however, the
Swarthmore forwards had changed
their strategy and began only throwing to the four position or a long pass
to loose forward Hanan Hussein '97
on line-outs, with significantly more
success.
"We weren't doing so well at first,
but we never gave up, and we improved on things that we could during the game. The rest will get improved this week at practice." said
Leora Cohen-McKeon '9B.
Rookies Alexa Miller 'OO and
Meghan Brennan 'OO played well in
their first-ever rugby game at loose
forward and fullback respectively.
Both players demonstrated poise and
skill beyond their experience. Amber
Halsey '9B debuted at hooker after a
long hiatus from rugby that included
a tour in Australia and a season in
Ware pool.
Halsey is a much-needed addition
in the forward pack because her size
is ideally suited to props Becky
Snyder '9B, Sarah Cross '99 and Cori
Garrett-Goodyear '99. Swarthmore's
scrum, in fact, was extremely strong
against B ucknell and did not give any
ground at all either offensively or

defensively.
The back line was led by Karli
Watson '97 at fly half and Andrea
Barnett '97 at inside center. Christina
Costas '99, Beth Vose '99, Morgan
Kelly '9B and Brennan rounded out
the back line. Watson and Barnett

had some excellent kicking plays,
but they spent most ofthe game playing catch-up with Bucknell's back
line. By the second half,
Swarthmore's inexperienced back
line was able to adjust to Bucknell's
strategy and hold its own.
TheB-side squad was short on players, so Jen Philpott '97 stayed in for a
secondgame at scrum half. Additionally, Amanda Rocque '97, Joan
Hoffman '9B, Snyder, Cross, Vose,
Cohen-Mc Keon, Costas and Brennan
stayed in to play all or half of the
second game. A few Bucknell players filled out the Swarthmore backline in the second half.
Forward captain Hussein commented to the team after the game,
"This was by far the best first B-side
game that I have ever seen
Swarthmore play." The final score
was 5-5.
Charity Miller '9B played a very
aggressive game at loose forward, a
new position for her, and made several key tackles. Becca Hover '99
played very well at eight and displayed a great ability to control the
ball in scrums.
Giovanna Giuliani '97, who decided to play rugby to get a gym
credit but has quickly learned to love
the sport, played an outstanding game.
Giuliani played at inside center for
the first half. She then switched to fly
half in the second and made more
tackles than any other player on the

field.
Anne McCasland-Pexton '97
played well at the wing, and had an
excellent run with Philpott to set up
the one Swarthmore try of the day.
The ball was actually touched down
in the try zone by a Bucknell player
after McCasland-Pextonand Philpott
set it up.
Swarthmore hosts York College
this Saturday at home at 12:30. In
their last match-up, Swarthmore
crushed York easily. All week
Swarthmore has been practicing a
new line-out strategy which includes
lifting the jumper. The backs have
been working on their tackling as
well, so Swarthmore will be primed
and ready.

Volleyball Defeats
Neumann, Widener
By

David Lischer

Sandwiching two Centennial Conference losses between two non-conference victories, the Swarthmore
women' s volleyball team had a week
of ups and downs. Heading into
Thursday night's match at FDUMadison, the team has brought its
record to 2-5 (0-3).
Last Thursday the Garnet traveled
to nearby Widener where they polished off their opponents 6-15,15-7,
15-11, 15-12 to earn their first victory of the season. Co-captain Jordan
Hay '9B sparked the team on with 19
set assists and with 10 digs.
Despite the win, the team could
have put together a cleaner performance. "The game was filled with
errors, we could have played a lot
better, but we had enough emotion
and intensity to overcome it," said
Holly Barton '9B.
The spirited and supportive attitude among the bench players generated much of the intensity and emotion. "The bench was so alive. The
team is great... our attitude is that no
matter what, we can't be beat. We
have the mentality that we can get to
every ball." said Barton.
Last weekend, the Garnet hosted
Gettysburg and Bryn Mawr in a trimatch. In their first match against

of Penn B. As with last weekend at
Lehigh, the Earthworms squad came
out hot, scoring the first four points
of the game with a scorching man-toman defense and a flawless offense.
Ben Rutter '97 was the early catalyst, getting an assist or score on each
of those four possessions. However,
the defense broke down and the Earthworms began to throwthe disc away,
allowing Haverford to score three of

the next six points.

play an entirely A-side game, so a
full-squad game was played.
The arrival of Robin Mandel '97
during the inter-game interval brought
the Swarthmore squad to nearly full
strength for this pivotal game. It was
obvious that Penn did not have the
depth to compete with Swarthmore;
they would find themselves mismatched all game.
The first half would end 7-3, as
Swat showed the domination that allowed themto win last week'sLehigh
tournament. Carl Mas '9B rebounded
from a tough Haverford game to lead
the defense in the first half. Gabe
Ross '96, visiting over the weekend,
started the game and put in three
good points before departing. Following in the alumni trend, Matt
Lawlor '95 contributed a defensive
block and his steady tutoring of the
Earthworm youth. The second half
began with a fired-up Penn squad
taking two points from Swarthmore,
but that trend was put to a stop by the
intense defense of Mike Morton '97.
Morton had been a force all day,
but in the second half of the Penn
game, he contested every Penn pass,
making the easy look extremely difficult. He also found the energy to
contribute several beautiful offensive
possessions, capped by multiple assists and scores. The game came to an
end with another Swarthmore victory, 13-6. This preserved the team's
perfect 6-0 record under captains Tim
Sibley '9B and Dave Sacker '97.
Asked about the day's games,
Sacker stated, "I was glad that we
were able to give some of our rookies
and sophomores big game experience in that last game with the Void.
I'm excited about the team's prospects for the rest of the season."
Besides the losses to Swarthmore,
Penn and Haverford also shared an
appreciation and envy for the ice
water, ice packs, and general support
that Swarthmore's trainers provided
for the day's events.
Doug Weiss and his
staff also prepared

Harriers Visit, Dominate Hopkins

This weekend, Swarthmore's cross-country team journeyed to Baltimore to go one-onone with Johns Hopkins. The team was supported by coaches Ted Dixon and Erica
Chiavetta, parents from around the area, and
supporters from the team who weren't racing.
Co-captain Danielle Wall '97, who was
taking a rest from competition, was around
every corner of the course, shouting things
like "Go Swat! You look strong! You're the
man! You're the terror that devours the hill!"
In addition, Coach Dixon had a pep talk for
the men that put everything in perspective:
"Okay, guys. Think of this as playing one-onone with your little brother. You know you
should beat him, but he's all excited, and he

bigger, and stronger, and meaner all the time.
But you just won't let him beat you. Now take
it out controlled in thefirst part of the race, and
I'll let you know if you need to go."
Despite the oddly positioned twists and
turns, the women's team was able to make it
through their course with virtually no problem. "It wasn't hard to follow, it was just very,
very long," said Sarah McClure 'OO.

tenth, both at 24:34. Swarthmore's score came

21, safely ahead of Hopkins' total of 41.

In the earlier games the International Team didn't miss a beat and
looked up to championship form as

slink back to their cellar and regroup

Buzzards Beaten
By Tony

Sturm

For the second straight week, the
men's rugby team traveled to inner
city Philadelphia, this time to take on
Drexel University in theirfirst league
match. The Evil Buzzards were put in
theirplace by Drexel, which doubled
up the Swarthmore squad, 20-10.
Drexel, which hadn't even started
classes at game time, seemed unprepared to take on the Swarthmore
squad, who had been practicing for
three weeks prior to the game. The
field had not been mowed all summer
untilright before gametime, had large
clumps of debris strewn about the
weeds, and had straw left standing on
the playing surface. The start of the
game was delayed as Drexel players
took cans of spray paint and bags of
powdered chalk and chalked out the
boundaries on the field.
Swarthmore was not in perfect
shape either. In the 24 hours before
game time, the Buzzards lost both of
their starting props to freak injuries.
The team was left with a forward
pack that had never scrummed together. Despite this handicap,
Swarthmore came out strong, dominating play early. Drexel was unable
to push the ball more than ten meters
from the try zone in the first few
minutes. Swarthmore drove the ball
into the try zone twice during that
time but was unable to free the ball
from their maul and touch it down for
the points.
Finally, ten minutes into the match,
Chris Jahnke '9B pulled the ball out
of a maul and dove into the try zone
for the game's first score. Jahnke

followed that score with another try a
few minutes later when he ran a quick
penalty in from five meters. Both
kicks were missed, but the Buzzards
still had a 10-0 lead and looked well
in control of the game.Drexel's lack
of practice showed, as they were
whistled for numerous infractions,
and seemed unable to do anything
without being penalized.
But slowly, Drexel came together,
and Swarthmore fell apart. Drexel's
forwards pushed as a team, and their
backs dropped fewer balls.
Just before half time, Drexel won a
scrum at the Swarthmore five meter
line, and winged the ball out to their
backs, who flipped the ball out to
their wing, who was able to touch the
ball down in the corner ofthe try zone
for the score. This made it 10-5
Swarthmore at the half.
The try gave Drexel momentum,
and they came out in the second half
more enthusiastic than the
Swarthmore squad. Ten minutes in,
Drexel's massive wing forward
dragged four Buzzards into the try
zone with him off a penalty play. The
conversion gave Drexel a 12-10 lead
which they would not relinquish.
Later in the game, Drexel added another try by their forwards, and they
converted a penalty kick on the last
play of the gameto clinch the victory.
In B-side action, Swarthmore once
again was trampled by the opposition. So many tries were scored by
Drexel's backs that everyone lost
count. Their wing scored at least four
tries himself, outsprinting the entire
Swarthmore squad down the sidelines many times.

Field Hockey Foiled by Astroturf upcoming
By

Jean Quinn

Swarthmore's field hockey team
took two road trips this past week
and came away with a win and a loss.
The Garnet (4-3 overall) remain undefeated and in first place in the
Centennial Conference.
Despite thelow score, Swarthmore
dispensed with Goucher rather easily, 1-0. "Goucher's team was very
physical and aggressive, (but) we
were the better skilled team," said
Coach Karen Borbee.
Midfielder Holly Baker '99, assisted by Erin Flather '97, scored the
game's lone goal with twenty minutes remaining in thefirst half. "Holly
Baker's goal was a very intelligent
goal. Their goalie kept going down
to make the save [on previous shots].

Holly simply shot the ball over her,"
said Coach Borbee.

Baker herself deflected all praise
and vociferously commended teammate Flather. "Erin should get the
credit for the one goal because she
did all the work for the ball to be in
front of the cage. She got by her
defender and drove the ball in near
the 25 yard line. My stick just happened to be in the right place at the
right time, and the ball deflected off
of it and arched up over the goalie's
head and fell into the goal," she said.
Baker is not the only one who recognized Flather's fine play. Flather
made the Conference HonorRoll this
week for leading S warthmore in "stellar defensive performances" en route
to defeating Franklin and Marshall
and Goucher and for assisting on the
game-winning goal against Goucher.
Swarthmore took 27 shots in the
game, and all but five were from
inside the circle. In contrast, Goucher

got off only four shots and goalie
Kelly Wilcox '97, having fully recovered from her concussion, had
to make only two saves the entire
game.Wilcox leads all goalkeepers
with a 91.9 save percentage and
recorded her second shut-out of the
season.

In the last thirty seconds of the
game, the Garnet had a ball headed
straight for Drew's cage that collided
with the foot of a Swarthmore player,
changing the ball's direction and
eliminating the possibility of overtime.

This weekend Swarthmore hosts

Against Drew, the Garnet did not
fare as well, and they fell by a score
of 2-1. Drew scored first on a penalty stroke, followed soon after by
Danielle Duffy's own goal off a
penalty stroke. Duffy, a junior, is
tied for first in conference scoring.
In the second half, Drew capitalized on a corner play and scored the
game-winning goal. "We just did
not take advantage of our opportunities. It was a good experience to
play on Astroturf, but our inexperience on the surface showe,." said
Borbee.

the Seven Sisters Tournament. The
Garnet are seeking theirthird straight
championship, but it won't be an easy
path to victory.
"We are going to have to beat three
strong teams in two days, including
Wellesley who went to the final four
last year and is ranked second in the
region this year," said Coach Borbee.
The first seeded Garnet begin the
defense of their championship title
this Saturday at 11:00 a.m. against
Vassar College on Cunningham
Fields, then again at 3:00 p.m. against
either Smith or Sweet Briar College.

Ely Brings Elan to

Women's Soccer
Team members
confident that their
new coach will bring
winning ways
By

Rachel Gutman

Alex Ely brings years of experience and dreams of success to the

Swarthmore women's soccer program. As the new head coach, Ely
hopes to "improve last year's record
and build the team to a point ofstability." While it's still too early to predictthe outcome ofthe season, Coach
Ely has already seen tremendous improvement in the players since the
beginning of the season.
Ely was born in Brazil, where he
grew up, but came to America to
attend the University of Maryland in
the 19605. He played soccer as a child
in his native country but was never on
any major team. "In Brazil soccer is a
major sport," and one is given much
respect if he or she has potential. Ely

showed early promise and dreamed
of one day having the opportunity to
play in a world class competition.
This aspiration was realized in 1959
when he won a bronze medal for the
United States soccer team in Chicago. He also played in the U.S. elimination games in 1962 and the World
Cup in 1966. In addition to receiving
five U.S. championships, Ely played
for the Ukrainian team in the 1960s
as a successful midfielder.
Having received "so many blessings from the sport," ranging from
the opportunity to enjoy a good education to the opportunity to travel all
over the world, Ely decided to "try to
put something back into the game"
that gave him so much.
He began coaching at Spring Garden College in 1979 and still looks
back fondly on that year as the one in
which his team beat heavily-favored
George Mason of Virginia, 1-0.

Alex Ely, women's soccer coach
From 1981 through the present he
was the head coach of the boy' s team
at Arch Bishop high school where he
taught Spanish and German. Coach
Ely has also coached semi-professional teams in New Yorkand Pennsylvania. He owns and oversees a
private team called American
Kolping, which has both men's and
women's soccer programs.
"There is dexterity in soccer and
also thinking. These are both good
for the student," he said. Ely believes
that sport is a way for one to improve
physically and mentally. Soccer is a
game of perseverance, says Ely, and
hard work takes a while, but it pays
off in the end.
Ely believes Swarthmore is a great
environment in which to coach. Because the school is academically oriented, the students have a different
perspective on playing. "They look
at soccer as a sport instead of something they must win at all costs," he
said. Ely stresses that soccer should
be played artistically rather than
roughly, "there is a beauty to the
sport that is more important than
even winning."
As head coach of the women's
team, Ely believes his role goes beyond the soccer field. He feels that a
coach must gain the respect of his
players, and then they will feel a
desire to work for him. "With that
drive to play hard, we're already
halfway to winning."

Last Saturday, the Garnet Tide
came up short one too many times
in a 42-7 loss to the Johns Hopkins

Bluejays at Clothier Field in
Swarthmore. The Tide's offense
failed to put together any effective
drives, and the defense was faced
with horrible field position throughout the course of the game. On top
of it all, special teams were found
extremely lacking.
Trouble loomed overhead right
away. After the Tide's first drive
stalled around their own 40 yard
line, they were forced to punt. The
punt was blocked by the extreme
pursuit of the Hopkins rush group.
The Bluejays got the ball deep in
Garnet territory, but the defensive
unit stopped them cold. The
Bluejays missed on their field goal
attempt.

Unfortunately for the Tide, the
offense and the punt team had repeat performances of the first drive.
After the second blocked punt of
the day, Hopkins went onto the
scoreboard with a field goal.
The next score of the game came

again at the hands of the punt team. On
its third time on the field, the ball was
snapped over the head of punter Adam
Booth 'OO and sailed out the back of
the endzone for a safety. Hopkins now
had the lead 5-0.
After the safety, the Hopkins offense again received the ball in excellent field position as a result of a poor
kickoff. It did not take the Bluejays
quarterback long before he found a
receiver in the endzone for the first
touchdown of the game. After a failed
two-point conversion attempt,
Hopkins held an 11-0 lead.
From there on out, there were al-

high points for the Tide. Before the half was over, the Bluejays

most no

had scored another field goal and another touchdown. The Tide faced the
prospect of a shutout in trailing 21 -0 at
halftime.
At the start of the second half,
Hopkins wasted no time and marched
down the field thanks to a reverse
return on the kickoff and a reverse
pass immediately following that. Two
plays later, another receiver found himself celebrating in the endzone after
catching a touchdown pass that made
the score 28-0.

Following the Bluejays touch-

down, Pat Straub '97 hooked up with
Mason Tootell '99 on a hitch and go
pass for a touchdown. This, however, did little to slow the Bluejays
onslaught. Hopkins scored on two
more passes and on one interception

which was returned for a score.
When the whistle had blown, the
Tide had been thoroughly run over
42-7 by the overwhelming Bluejays.
Generally, the defensive unit of the
Tide played a good game allowing
274 total yards with only 104of those
being rushing yards. However, they
were faced not only with poor field
position to deal with but also with
fatigue as they were on the field for
the majority of the game. The Tide's
fatal flaw of the game was its incapability to move the ball on offense and
their weak special teams.
These, however, do hope to be
remedied before the Tide travel to
Gettysburg Saturday to face the Bullets. The Bullets are coming off of a
win this past week against Western
Maryland. This next contest is a
chance to start again for the Tide in a
season that still has a long way to go
before it is over.

Men's Soccer Fights Back
By

Shulamit Shapiro

Yet again, theSwarthmore men's
soccer team confronted serious obstacles in its quest for victory. Last
Saturday, the team lost to Johns

Hopkins 3-1.
"We faced some tough chak
lenges," said co-captain Amber
"Waves of Grain" Thompson '97.
"We had to play on turf which we
haven't played on yet this year,"
said Thompson.
According to Thompson, turf is
a harder surface to play on than
grass. It allows the ball to move a
lot faster, but it makes it more difficult to control and is tougher on
the legs and body overall.
"We also had a lot of injuries and
some red cards (penalties). For example, co-captain Kyle 'House of
Style' Barnett got a red card in the
last game, which means that he
wasn't allowed to play in this

game," said Thompson.
As a result of the missing players,
there were more freshmen than usual
who were starters and actively involved
in the game. Overall Thompson was

pleased with the team's performance.
"Everyone was excited about the
game even though we lost. It was a
good game and the team played very
well," said Thompson.
On Wednesday the team exacted a
measure of revenge by defeating
Stevens Tech 3-2. The team had lost to
Stevens Tech earlier this month.
Thompson described a tricky maneuver performed by himself and by
John "Fiddler on the"Rufus Frazer' 99
which resulted in a score.
"Rufus headed the ball, which hitthe
cross bar and bounced back to me. I
finished it and tied the game 1-1," said

Thompson.
Co-captain Dave "In the Fast" Lane

team since spraining his ankle a few

weeks ago. "I love playing, even

though my injury isn't one-hundred
percent healed. I was happy to win,"
said Lane.
Lane hopes that the team will be
able to regain some of the ground it
has lost due to the injuries and also to

the fact that the head coach has been
away recently. Coach Wayne
McKinney, who spends his "free
time" working for an insurance company, has been out of town helping
victims of the recent hurricane.
"We're sick of losing. There's no
reason why we won't beat the next
five or six teams we play. We'll be
intense and ready for the next game,"
said Thompson.

Sarah Jaquette '9B, a forward on Swarthmore's soccer team is greatly
respected by her teammates for her leadership ability, extraordinary
athletic skill and devotion to the team. Some of the greatest praise for Sarah
came from Betsy Rosenbaum '9B who praised Sarah for having a "good
attitude and being a good leader." Janice Gallagher '99, another ofSarah's
teammates, considers Sarah to be an "extremely effective player" and
praised her for her ability to "control the ball, see the field and make plays

happen."
The fact that Sarah is the team's scoring leader attests to her athletic
ability. Sarah is the player who scored the winning goal against Ursinus in
the first Conference gameof the season. Last SundaySarah also scored the
winning goal against Holyoke (1-0). This goal led Swarthmore to a third
place finish in the Seven Sisters tournament. Beth Wiles '9B believes that
Sarah is not only skilledand dedicated but also a player who "is able to raise
the level of play of the team."

MikeMorton '97 played a steady role in the offense and defense of the
Earthworms in victories over Haverford and Penn in the tournamet. Mike
is one of the backbones of this year's strong team. However, it was his
play in the second half of the Penn game that makes him deserving of
Athlete of the Week
He single-handedly stopped several Penn scores with insane layout
defense that fired up the Swarthmore sideline and extinguished Penn's.
Additionally, he was a participant in the majority ofSwarthmore's second
half goals with either an assist or the score itself.
Mike is also known for his willingness to help out novice players.
Roger Bock '99 commented on Mike's dedication to the team's success,
butalso manages to maintain an enthusiastic attitude towards the sport He
is also one of the few seniors who shows up consistently for practice.

Friday night's team dinner, the
Warmothers are hoping to fare well
at this tournament designed for teams
with lots of new players. With so
many players traveling, it would be
crazy if to send only one team.
The captains want everyone to get
ample playing time. Captain Mandy
Hourihan '9B described team situation, "We're going to split into two
teams. We were going to do an A
team and a B team, but we didn't
want to send a team entirely composed of rookies to fend for themselves at their first tournament, so
we're going to mix it up."
When asked what their goals for
this tournaments were, answers varied. Captain Gabi Kruks-Wisner '99
wishes "to see the Warmothers come
together as a solid unit. Sectionals are
the following weekend." Annie Bacon '99, a rookie, hopes "her basic
playing becomes more skilled and
automatic."

At roughly 5 p.m. last Friday
evening, the women's soccer team
pulled out of the field house lot, traveling in style in a deluxe bus, and
commenced their journey to
Wellesley, Massachusetts to participate in the Seven Sisters Soccer Tournament. Nine hours later, at two in
the morning, they arrived.
Along the way the team experienced the joys of an hour of Philadelphia rush hour traffic, an hourofNew
York rush hour traffic, and an inexplicable hour ofConnecticut rush hour
traffic at 10 pm. Said Kirstin Knox
99 ofthe adventure, T ve never been
to Connecticut before. Who knew it
was such a happening place?"
Things continued along the same
semi-dismal theme as the team took
the field the next day against a much
more experienced Wellesley squad.
For the first 30 minutes of the game,
Swarthmore put on an impressive
showing against the very talented
Wellesley players. Although
Wellesley was pounding the ball at
the net, goalkeeper Anne Holland
'99 and the rest of the defense did an
admirable job of preventing
Wellesley from finishing.
With 15 minutes left in the first
half, Wellesley scored its first goal
and the spirit seemed to leave the
Swarthmore side. At half-time, the
team was down 4-0. Head Coach
Alex Ely attempted to pull things
together during the break between
halves, however, Swarthmore was
simply outmatched.
Sparked by junior Sarah Jaquette's
tough play on the forward line and
sophomore outside halfback Amy
Markey's solid return from injury,
the team was able to continue its
tradition of strong second half play.
In fact, Swarthmore looked great in
the last 15 minutes of the game, generating several scoring opportunities
on net. Unfortunately, no goals were
scored and Wellesley ended up with
a definitive 8-0 victory.
Swarthmore next faced Mount
Holyoke College for fourth place in
the tournament. The players found
this game to be much more to their
liking since the teams were about
equal in skill level. The players appeared to be genuinely enjoying themselves as they battled the Mount
Holyoke "yokes" for control of the
game. Knox and Jaquette continued
their impressive play in the middle of
the field, and Emily Manetta 'OO
stepped into the goal for her first ever
collegiate start. Manetta did a great
job as she calmly posted a first half
shut-out.
Janice Gallagher '99 rebounded
from an off game against Wellesley
to terminate Holyoke's main offensive threat, an elusive and very tall
attacker. In addition, Rebecca Schmitt
'99 continued to be extremely impressive in her role as sweeper.
As the two sides were very well
matched, they remained deadlocked
throughout regulation. Thankfully,
the game did not end up going to a
shoot-out. Roughly eight minutes into
the first overtime, reserve forward
Melissa Morrell '99 took an intelligent shotfrom her outside wing position that was deflected toLaura Starita
'97. Staritaheaded the ball to Jaquette,
who put the pass home for the winning goal. This victory marked the
first time Swarthmore had defeated a
Seven Sisters opponent in threeyears.
Said ClaireBaxter '9B ofthe game,
"For the first time, we played 90
minutes of soccer."
