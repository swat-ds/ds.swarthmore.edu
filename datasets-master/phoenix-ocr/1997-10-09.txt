Printouts have vanished, a network outage
is scheduled for next Monday, and the new
Netscape browser runs excruciatingly slow
on some machines. But although the Computing Center has already run into these minor problems this semester, the staffinsists
the difficulties are not indicative of any underlying disarray within the organization;
rather they have come about coincidentally,
for unrelated reasons.
The greatest frustration of late for public
area computer users has been the "flushing"
of documents (a term referring to a software
error that occasionally prevents documents
from printing). 15% of all documents have
been flushed this semester, estimates Dylan
Humphrey '9B, Dispatcher Manager, making it a major problem for users who print to
the Beardsley printers.
The trouble came about when the Computing Center upgraded its "spooler"—the
computer in the dispatcher's room that controls thefour printers —this past summer. The
new Power Macintosh7100, whichreplaced
a Quadra, came with a new version of the
Macintosh system software that they hoped
would remedy stability problems with the
older system. However, the upgrade brought
about other unanticipated difficulties, since
the new system software still uses the
LaserWriter 7 protocol for printing, while
some computers require LaserWriter 8. In
particular, PostScript graphics, from such
applications as Mathematica and Matlab,
tend to conflict with the older protocol.
Humphrey says users should try printing a
flushed document again from withinanother
similar application. He concedes this is difficult for word processing documents, since
WordPerfect is the only official word processor on public area machines; but for users who have access to ClarisWork orWord,
he says, this is the best option. He also sug-

gests that engineers print to Hicks printers,
and other departments print to their respective printers, if they have them. If documents
must be sent to Beardsley, he encourages
printing to different printers, if necessary.
Ideally, he says it's best to "get your work
done a little ahead of time, so you have time
to print out on multiple printers, if you have
to."
Fortunately, the CC received the new version of the spooler software yesterday and
hopes to install it either today or tomorrow,
according to Eric Behrens, Humanities Computing Coordinator. Behrens believes this
should solve the problem.
On an unrelated matter, a campus-wide
network outage is planned for next Monday
at 5 p.m., running through Tuesday at 7:30
a.m. at the latest, to give the ComputingCenter time to install a backup power supply for
the Beardsley public area. The outage will
only affect services based in Beardsley, such
as the Internet gateway and campus servers,
according to Bob Velez, Network Administrator. Networks connections within dorms
will be unaffected.
The power supply would maintain an uninterrupted flow ofpower to Beardsley computers, should normal power go out, says
Ralph Thayer, Director of Maintenance. Although there is no backup system in place
right now, such a system is deemed a necessity, because an immediate loss of power
would be disastrous for the equipment in the
building.
While an erroneous campus-wide e-mail
mistakenly identifiedthis past Monday as the
date, the outage is in fact planned for this
coming Monday.
Responding to user complaints that
Netscape Communicator, which replaced
Navigator on public area machines, runs
painfully slow, Chris Couples, Social Sciences Computing Coordinator, acknowledges the problem but says that it's out of
the CC's control— at least for now.

The summer of 1997 saw the
inauguration of the Summer
Community Learning Project
(S.C.L.P), a program aimed at
generating self-reliance and
bonding between adolescent
girls in grades five through
seven.
The project was the brainchild of six Swattie women in
the class of '99 who, after taking an education course involving adolescence, became
alarmed by the huge self-esteem slides that adolescent girls

often experience in educational, social, and physical matters.

The S.C.L.P ran for two
weeks in June at the Women's
Resource Center behind
Sharpies. Coordinated by
Nicole Breazeale, Elisa
Nigrini, Erica Turner, Andrea
Meller, Mandara Meyers, and
Chloe Dowley, its program involved 3 curricula, "Individual," "Social," and "Global,"
each dealing with a different
aspect of adolescence.
The "Individual" curriculum
stressed self-awareness through
activities including "Who We

Are" self-descriptions and
daily journal entries.
The "Social" curriculum dealt
with understanding thegroups

thinks about herself, and her
concept of people in general.
The "Global" curriculum was
aimed towards enhancing educational skills in the sciences,
as well as supporting an understanding of individual functions
within communities. These
two objectives were realized
together by studying biological

(U-WIRE) WASHINGTON —As the
debate escalates over the fairness of voluntary affirmative action admissions and
hiring policies, the idea of affirmative
action could be expelled from campuses
for good depending on how the Supreme
Court rules on a new case it has put at
the top of this year's docket.
The Supreme Court began its new term
Monday by accepting an appeal of a
workplace discrimination case that
threatens to end all voluntary affirmative action guidelines. The Board of Education of Piscataway N.J. v. Taxman will
require the court to decide whether or

Piscataway Board of Education brought
to court for firing white HS teacher
not racial employment guidelines are

acceptable under any circumstances.
In 1989,the Piscataway Board of Education cut one high-school business
teacher position from its budget. Of two
existing business instructors, one was
white and the other was black. In order
to protect racial diversity at the school,
the board decided to lay off the white
teacher. Eight years later, Sharon
Taxman was reinstated because other
teachers retired, but continues her claim
of discrimination in the initial layoff.

In anticipation of the high
court's decision to hear the Piscataway
case, the American Association of College Registrars and Admissions Officers
began a two-day policy summit Monday
to discuss higher education diversity
policies and tactics.
"Our goal is to promote diversity on
campus," said Daren Bakst, director of
government relations at the lobbying
branch of AACRAO. "The environment
is changing, and we have to find the best
practices for the climate." Bakst empha-

sized the importance of working with
opposing views to find guidelines for the
future.
But Hilary Shelton, assistant director
of the Washington chapter of the
NAACP, is not as optimistic about the
opportunities campuses would face in
the wake of a possible anti-affirmative
action court ruling.
"Affirmative action has opened the
door for women and ethnic minorities in
places we were traditionally locked out
of," said Shelton. Eliminating the policies and goals created by such programs
""would mean the resegregation of society."
The policy summit will continue Tuesday with the Piscataway case leading the
discussion throughout the day.

named the
number one liberal arts school in
the nation for the second year running. Unfortunately, we lack one
of the most fundamental aspects of
a healthy college life: Swarthmore
students have no school spirit.
Any one of the very few students
who actually attends school athletic
events can tell you that other
Swatties hardly ever show up. Even
at football games, which are relatively well attended, the visiting
team frequently dwarfs the Garnet's
supporters, many of whom are not
even students here anyway. At a
campus that ostensibly prides itself
on its overall activism and enthusiasm, such clear apathy smacks of
hypocrisy. Innumerable off-capus
concerns, Crum monitoring and
perpetual fruitless arguments over
who can be more liberal inexplicably take precedence over campus
issues vital to the overall balance
of school life.
Yet the issue is not simply as clear
cut as a school-wide case of apathy on the part of students. Some
students say they have too much
work, others claim they don't watch
games because of the poor quality
of play and dismal standings of
Swarthmore athletic teams. But
these excuses aren't thereal reasons
for our lack ofenthusiasm. Ifthey
were, every Swattie who had "too
much work" wouldn't participate in
any extra-curricular activities and
a losing team like football wouldn't
draw more fans than a winning
team like field hockey.
The real reason behind the lack
of student support for athletic
events lies with Swat's uniquely

warped campus culture.

stunts the students' willingness to

show up on your transcript as nicely
as a 4.0 GPA or a presidency of the
Chem club. By placing the emphasis solely on intellectual pursuits
and relegating social events to a
secondary status, Swarthmore creates a lopsided campus mentality.
This imbalance promotes the fragmentation of the campus and
dampens studententhusiasm for the
school as a whole. We are so busy
being "Swarthmore students" that
we don't have time to cease our
neurotic stressing and hang out at
a game once or twice a month.
No one knows our fight song or
our alma matter. We don't have a
mascot. There's no such thing as a
home field advantage at
Swarthmore. People treat the football team as a perennial joke without having ever watched a game.
And the worst part is we do it to
ourselves.
Not only do administrators and
faculty seldom encourage anything
otherthan the strictest obedience to
Swarthmore's rigorous academics,
as students we ourselves seem to
take a perverse sort of pride in our
anti-normal world view. We're so
obsessed with being different and
being Swatties that we reject
wholesale all of college's "stereotypical" qualities notably, school
spirit without examining them.
Not only will a sense of scholastic pride do wonders forall student
atheletes, it will also invigorate
campus life and renew the dismal
mindset of many Swatties.

Swat students are pretty wimpy relatively speaking
To the editor:
While stopping by the ice cream
bar at Sharpies recently, I realized
just how wussy Swarthmore really is. I mean, let's face it people,
we are straight-up wimps. I know,
the ice cream is really frozen, but
it shouldn't take us 10 minutes
just to get 2 scoops. Sweat was
pouring down Swatties faces.
They strained every muscle in
their puny little bodies, as they
worked furiously to get that perfect scoop of Butter Pecan.
Seriously, we are weak. Though
"hermitian operators" may be a
phrase in many students vocabulary, "weight room" is not. We
look like scrawny, malnourished
supermodels (the guys at least)
trying to cover it up by wearing
baggy jeans and shirts two sizes
too large. This is not an easilysolved dilemma. In fact, I see no
solution in sight, other than regimented body building and Mon-

day Night Football watching. Sure,
there are some guys out there who
are pretty tbugh (or at least think
they are, in the case ofDU and Phi
Psi), but I mean, tough compared
to whom? (Note: No truly tough
people use the word "whom.")
The ice cream bar incident started
me thinking, if Swat got into an allout rumble with other schools, who
would win? What other upstanding institutions could we actually
kick the crap out of? Okay, for starters we could definitely take
Haverford, not only because they
are wimps, but also because we
have the mental edge; I mean, they
all wanted to gohere and didn't get
in. I think we could also beat up
Bryn Mawr, although that would be
a little closer. On that same note,
we could probably have our way
with all of the former Seven Sisters (yes, that means you, Vassar).
This is where our dominance
ends. Williams and Amherst would

clobberus. Most Ivy League Med
Schools could kick our asses and
then stitch us back up at exorbitant prices. I think the only Division One school that we could take
is Akron, powerhouse of the
midwest. This would be a very interesting fight. I propose that Akron become our nemesis, as
Haverford is merely a waste of
time. Listen up, Akron's sports
teams are known as "The Zips."
The Zips, people. The storied
Swarthmore-Akron rivalry could
go down in history up there with
Michigan-Ohio State and FloridaFlorida State. Oh, and by the way,
we should try to stay as far away
from offending Florida State as
possible. The result of an allschool brawl between us and
Florida State would be disastrous.
I wholeheartedly respect Florida
State and everything that it stands
for. Even though it may be scary, I
will now attempt to speculate on

the casualties accumulated in such
rumbles:
' Swarthmore 1,400 CasualtiesFlorida State 300 (FSU'ers get carried away in their celebration)
Swarthmore 600-Haverford
1,000 (Piece of Cake)
Swat 20-Vassar 2,346 (All of
Swat's losses would be English
Majors)
And now the true test:
Swat 750-Akron Zips 24,351
(This leaves us with one more student than those pesky "Zips.")
In closing, I propose that U.S.
News and World Report add a new
category to their college rankings:
Wuss Factor. Although this may be
damaging to our total score, it
would provide a valuable service
to any prospective student (at least
those wimpy enough to use U.S.
News to pick their college).

In my column last week about

Unfortunately, its headline lent
the piece a different connotation.
I had asked the Phoenix not to

clear-cut judgment; I regret that
the extremely strong word "misogyny" was associated with my

differs considerably from the perception of possible "mysogyny,"
according to the headline on the
op-ed piece by Tim Stewart-Winter in last week's issue. We were
instead excited to learn the results
of the first genuinely comprehensive survey ofAmerican worker attitudes, a landmark study that will
soon affect policy debate. The
Rogers-Freeman survey (named
after Rogers, who teaches at the
University of Wisconsin, and Rich-

ers want autonomous representation at the workplace. We also
found that the half-hour questionand-answer session as instructive
as the talk. In the course of about
a dozen questions from male and
female professors, students, and
members of the general public, all
taken seriously and respectfully,
we were able to see a genuinely
orginal social thinker at work.
We hope that the Phoenix will
decide to cover, as a news story,
the final talk in the Cooper Foundation lecture series on the chang-

Lichtenstein, one of the country's

most distinguished labor historians. In covering this news event,

and the workshop that follows it,
the Phoenix would serve the many
people-students, staff, administration, buildings and grounds people,
custodians, security officers, and
faculty—who make Swarthmore

have a test tomorrow.
What do you do? A) Watch "Seinfield,"
B) Take a nap, C) True D) Make out with a
girl or E) All of the above.
If you're a procrastinator like me these
are some of the temptations you face, when
you should be hitting the books.
We all suffer from procrastination and the
stages we go through include: relaxation,
worry, forgetfulness, more worry, all-out
panic and then we finally study.
If you are reading this column, then you
are likely putting off more important matters and needlessly procrastinating. Instead,
you should be paying attention to your professor and his boring lecture instead of
reading my column. So go ahead, take five
minutes to get your affairs in order.
OK, glad you're back.
The problem with procrastination is that
students find themselves cramming too
much, with too little time to really learn
anything at all.
Think of those cartoons you watched when
you were younger and picture the big pink circus elephant hiding from a mouse by stuffing
himself into a soda can. For a few briefs moments the elephant stays crammedinto the can,
but when the mouse comes around snooping,
the elephant must always pop out and, well,
you know the rest.
Just like the pink elephant, you try to fit
massive amounts of information in your
brain (soda can) for a short period of time.
If you are a procrastinator
I know you
are
then you probably try to cram eight
chapters of molecular biology into your
head the night before the test.
You have all heard the myth that your
brain does not absorb information past 2
in the morning, but you want to beat the
odds.You're tired, you want to go to sleep
and you want the impossible "A." So what

do you do?You
turn it up a
notch, your ste-

reo that is. Your
roommate
turns to you

nervously as
the themefrom
Rocky plays
and he knows
what time it is:
It's game time
HOOO!
A half hour later you've somehow managed to learn the names and years of every
American war and the Periodic Table of Elements
backward. So now you're ready
for the test, you're feeling good and you
think, "I'll just lay down for a few minutes
to refresh myself." Hours later you wake
with a jolt of terror as you realize that your
alarm clock has betrayed you and the test
begins in 15 minutes.
With boogers in your eyes and breath to
kill, you dash out of bed, grab a ballcap, a
blue book and pencil.
With the hunger ofChris Farley chasing a
Good Humor truck and the speed of Carl
Lewis on the last leg of a 4x4 relay in the
Olympics, you race to the classroom.
With visions of "A"s written across the
back of your test booklet followed by a note
from the teacher saying, "Good job," you
feel cool and confident. As you are nearing
the White Hall Classroom Building, people
split like the Red Sea as they look on at their
fellow procrastinators passing by on Judgment Day.
Finally you enter the dungeon of doom
(classroom) and the casually dressed teacher
hands out the tests.
Why do teachers feel they don't need to
...

dress up on test days? Things that
make you go hmmm ? With the smell of
fear accompanied by your kickin' breath,
you open the test. You close the test. You
open the test again. You panic.
You never even think of cheating because it is immoral and you also do not
want to be that guy. You know, the guy
who gets called out in the middle of class
and he gets his test taken away like a puny,
foolish, pathetic twerp.
As you start reading the test you forget
everything you studied the night before.
All that information is gone. You begin
thinking of the pink elephantpopping out
of the can and running from the mouse.
You want to run from the test, but you
can't. You want to be the pink elephant.
You love pink elephants.
Like a blind-folded Gheorge Muresean
swinging at a pinata you make "educated"
guesses on the trick questions.
All of you students out there need to
drop procrastinating like Ric Flair in a
DDT. If you don't, you'll end up broke
with no job, no education and no front
teeth, "Livin' in a van down by theriver!"
Get ahead in life, don't be the pink elephant.

talk
bout
diversity. Last
week I saw a
letter to the editor
appear in The Phoenix that proclaimed
the College's goal
and purpose to provide the absolute
best academic environment that a
Andrew
young college stuBryce
dent could hope for.
Diversity, the letter
said, should not be
considered a reason for recruitment or admittance to this fine institution of learning.
The only grounds for admittance should be
ability, the only authority, excellence, and
it is the job of society to lead children of
minority to excellence in elementary school
rather than give them the illusion of it later
on in life when it is really too late anyway.
I thought for a long time about this. I have
heard for a long time, long before I came
here, that diversity is a huge societal step
towards Utopia, that wherever you went,
things would be fine if only diversity followed. Is this really true? What, in reality,
does diversity do to a place like
Swarthmore? It sounds kind of pat and trite,
and has been beaten to a politically correct
death to the point where anyone but the
most devout liberal will just smile and nod
at things such as "DiversityWorkshop", but
I believe that diversity is the absolute, endall, most valuable virtue about which
Swarthmore College can boast.
I agree, it is wonderful that we can call
ourselves the best liberal arts college in the
country, and it is wonderful that
Swarthmore is good and challenging
enough that we can have t-shirts that proclaim that it would have been an A anywhere else. I love the challenge of this
school. I have learned things here about the
world thatI never even knew existed. But /
do not care if we are first or tenth or fifteenth in the U.S. News and World Report,
and / do not care if our average SAT scores
are twenty or thirty or fifty points lower
than their maximum potential. I do not see
these things as the most important parts of
the college community.
What I have really learned here, what the
most real and difficult challenge I have
found here is trying to cope with the idea
that Life is not a constant, that there are

ideas and philosophies that have absolutely nothing to do with what I conceive
of the world to be. I come from a very
homogeneous little town where you are
either white or hispanic and conform to
one of two basic philosophies that really
aren't that much different to begin with.
Although I knew that there were other
forms of thought, I found it very hard to
understand and cope with. I really had no
conception of what those other ideas might
be until I came here. The purpose of
Swarthmore is to replace such ignorance
with knowledge of the world today and to
show us again and again that there are
other voices, and that those voices are saying things that we never would have even
considered to exist.
I have always thought of myself as liberal and tolerant, but I am stunned at how
ready to accept other and alien aspects of
the world I have become since I came here
last year. I thrill in seeing myself finally
taking my place in the world. I am beginning to see what the whole world is like
beyond those aspects ofit that I have lived.
Such vision is the highest lesson life can
teach anyone, and it transcends Einstein
and Descartes and Sophocles; what use is
Sophocles if one does not truly understand
how the world really is? I believe that I
am learning how the world really is, and I
attribute that to the fact that Swarthmore
makes it a point to have a very diverse student body. Let us consider a hypothetical
college of homogeneity. This college can
have the best academics in the world, and
its students can be the most intellectually
developed in the world, but if those genius minds do not learn about the rest of
the world other than what they study, then
the college is not really teaching them, because they will leave the school with a very
incomplete concept of humanity.
Let us not lose sight of the real lesson.
When a place like Swarthmore declares
diversity to be a part of the admissions process, it declares in a loud voice that it has
not lost sight of what life really is for. Really, when it comes down to it, that's all a
college is for, isn't it, to teach people about
different aspects of life? That is what diversity is for, and that is what Swarthmore
does, and so let us rejoice in it and look
upon it as Swarthmore's gift to us. Around
us is the world, my friends. Let us never
lose it.

Promise Keeper’s Rhetoric Downplays
Women’s Victimization

3y Molly Hennessy-Fiske
The Harvard Crimson

(U-WIRE) CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
In a recent letter to the editor of the

Bucknell campus newspaper, The
Bucknellian, a female student who had
been the victim of domestic abuse spoke
out about the nature of her struggle against
oppression.
"Women who are abused are not justphysically beaten, but are brainwashed to believe
that they deserve to be treated as less than
human, because they are women," she wrote.
"Abuse is about power
the power men
have over women in our society."
As the conservative Christian Promise
Keepers crowded Washington, D.C. last
Saturday for
"Standing in
iff
the Gap," a
national convent i on
aimed to save
the souls of
errant husbands, attention was diverted from
the fact that
every
six
hours
a
woman dies in the U.S. as a result of domestic violence. The real problem behind
marital abuse
women's second-class status
was ignored altogether as men
bonded over Bibles, doing their best to suppress women&sup 1;s voices with a mix of
secrets and lies.
Promise Keepers president Randy
Phillips told The NewYork Times that, "We
are not a political organization. We do not
have any political goals." Someone should
let Promise Keepers supporters and religious-right politicos from Pat Buchanan to
evangelists Dale D. Schlafer and Billy Graham in on that secret.
"God is not calling us to a playground,
he is calling us to a battleground," said Graham in a video-message presented at
"Standing in the Gap." "This is warfare,
and we are at the center of the battle."
How do you combat spousal abuse when,
for example, a man grows frustrated by his
nagging wife and decides to beat her for
being the breadwinner?
"Sit down with your wife," recommends

Promise Keeper spokesperson Tony Evans,
"and say something like this, 'Honey, I've
made a terrible mistake. I've given you my
role. I gave up leadership of this family :
now I must reclaim that role.' There can be
no compromise here. If you're going to lead,
you must lead."
Promise Keepers are the latest line of defense for the religious right, and their weapons ofchoice are lies.
Women are lied to by men who promise
love and keep abusing them in the interest
of Christian patriarchy, and both women and
men are lied to by a group of men that say
the inequity of women's work garnering low
pay and little respect is not only
logical but justifiable.
Promise Keepers are right to encourage
men?especially
abusive men
in
stepping forward
and asking for
are
help. The secret is
that both men and
ll women
appreciate
the potential joys
of married life; both men and women enjoy
raising families and participating in community networks and both men and women
would like to avoid the emotional and economic trauma of divorce.
So why, if communication and understanding are mutual goals, should one gender
choose to wage war on the other in the interests of discussion?
"Promise Keepers gives moral legitimacy
to men who wish to regain power," said
Promise Keepers spokesperson Jay Coakly
in a recent NewYork Times interview. "Men
in general, and white men in particular, feel
they haven't been treated fairly and they
need to get together to make sure that won't
happen in the future."
If you switch the word "men" to "women,"
that statement sounds a lot like what Patricia
Ireland has been saying about women's
struggle for equality ever since she became
president of the National Organization for
Women (NOW), a group that Promise Keepers so staunchly opposes.

Promise Keepers are the
latest line ofdefensefor the
religious right, and their
weapons of choice
lies.

—

As Ireland noted in reponse to recent
Promise Keepers critiques of NOW,
women's bodies are not broken by abuse
because they can't make the marriage
dream work and exclusive male groups
will do little to solve the problem. Women
like Ireland who fight for their right to be
equal and who often consider themselves
feminists are not, as Coakly says, "Just
looking for the right man to lead them'
they are taking the lead.
It is significant that as hundreds of thousands of men crowded onto the Mall last
Saturday, not one single woman was to

7»

denial continues, the chances are that current undergraduates will soon count them-

selves among the casualties.
If Promise Keepers are genuinely interested in helping women, they should stop
battling us
assuming that their actions
are in our best interest
and start talking.
Productive conversations between spouses,
brothers and sisters, or between male and
female co-workers encourage the abused
to speak out against domestic violence. And
they unearth the false assumptions Promise Keepers make propagate a patriarchal
inequality through secrets and lies..

Promise Keepers is fighting to subdue
budding female leadership in America.
Therefore, it comes as no surprise that campus conservatives recently brought the

ments against school condom programs. The logic goes that if you give
teenagers condoms, you are, in a sense,
giving them permission to have sex.
The study disproves that argument. The
rate of sexual activity has not increased
this year, a positive step forward for the
schools. This study shows schools can

make a real difference in young
people's lives by actively promoting safe sex and responsibility.
It is about time. About a quarter of
new HIV infections and three million
other sexually transmitted disease cases
occur in 13- to-19 year-olds.
Although only one-fifth of sexually active students reported receiving a condom
from school, those having frequent sex received school condoms more often than
students who have less frequent sex. This
shows students know the dangers of their
behavior and are doing something about
it.
We cannot deny that high school students
are having sex. The same study shows
nearly one in 10 New York City students
reports having three or more partners in six
months. This is a situation that can no
longer be ignored. Condom programs in

schools are actively combating the dire
consequences of unsafe sex.
In New York City, specially-trained
teachers make condoms available in special health resource rooms. It is intimidating for young people to go to authority figures and ask for condoms. It is a good system but could be better. Instead, vending
machines in bathrooms or locker rooms
would make access easier for students.
School personnel do not have to be involved.
We can either ignore the problem and
watchyoung people die from AIDS related
conditions or other sexually transmitted
diseases. Or we can give students the information and the tools to make the choice
to save their own lives.
We congratulate the New York City
school system on their success and hope
to see more of it in Ohio.

(U-WIRE) Preferential hiring is

State University.
At a meeting with the NAACP in
Spokane, WSU administrators announced three black faculty would
be preferentially hired by the end
of the school year.
Now, officials say the statement
was misrepresented. "It is illegal
to have set asides," Provost
Gretchen Bataille said. "We can't
do it."
Instead, the university is looking
into programs to provide opportunities to diversify the makeup of the
WSU faculty.
Thus far no progress has been
made. "Nothing's been done,"
Bataille said. "I'm waiting for recommendations from the deans."
Neil Walker, who was present at
the late-evening NAACP meeting,
said at the time the statement was
made, he knew something was

"I'm not calling them out, but I
want them to be accountable for the
successful recruitment and retention of people of color," Walker
said.
The three-hour discussion centered around the "Black Exodus,"
a term used by several in the WSU
community to describe the departure of 16 Black faculty and staff
members over the summer.
The predominately AfricanAmerican audience wanted to know
why 16 Black faculty and staff left
the university.
University officials restated their
claims ofcommitment to diversity
on campus. Bataille said the commitment is still intact.
Others who attended the meeting
are upset and leery of the
administration's pledges. Student
Ed Prince wonders if the session
had any productive outcomes.
"At the time, I felt they were making progress. Now I'm wondering
if they've been honest with us the

U. Perm police target parties in fight against alcohol Tufts crewers find corpse

Daily Pennsylvannian

(U-WIRE) Spurred by a recent
rash of alcohol-related assaults, University of Pennsylvannia and state
police officials plan to step up their
fight against underage drinking
putting a new emphasis on patrolling rowdy private parties.
In a recent forum on the issue, University Police and the state Liquor
Control Enforcement Bureau emphasized plans to attack the problem
from many angles, including citing
restaurants and bars that sell to minors, arresting students who break
liquor laws or shutting down campus parties if they violate the law.
Police representatives opened the
meeting with Penn and Drexel University officials and local bar and
restaurant owners as part of efforts
to explain everyone's responsibili-

ties clearly and answer any questions
about police policy.
Director of Police Operations
Maureen Rush praised most area liquor license holders for following
the law, noting that University Police focuses much of its efforts on
combatting underage drinking at
parties.
"By no means are we saying that
restaurants and bartenders are the
only concern," she explained.
Managing Director of Public
Safety Tom Seamon added that University Police "will be stepping up
our enforcement, and much of that
will be directed to private parties."
The LCE will continue to play an
important role in the effort by "intervening" in parties that spill out
into the street and "going in and
making arrests" at open off-campus
parties charging entrance fees, LCE
supervisor Gary Kardisco said.

"We came under the BU Bridge

Although it was unsafe to stop the

after noticing the body, Wolf explained that the rowers stopped as

are beautiful when viewed with
the naked eye; I have often lain in the
grass in rural Pennsylvania and stared
in awe at the sparkling orbs of light.
However, when planetary bodies are seen with
a telescope, their details spring at you—what
seems to be a ball of white fire is a planet with
scarlet rings. It has the air of an epiphany—the sudden understanding of what was previously unknown.
This past Tuesday, on October 7th, the Physics and Astronomy department held a Sproul
Observatory Visitors Night. There were few
Swarthmore students at the event, but a high
school teacher brought a bevy of his students
from the Christian Academy in Brookhaven.
The teenagers expressed enthusiasm for the
field trip; they eagerly lined up to look at Jupiter and Saturn. It was stunning to see the red
rings and four moons of Jupiter through the
telescope; without its magnifying power, the
planet looks much like the stars in the sky.
Many of the Brookhaven students seemed especially excited to see the moons of Saturn.

Usually, visitors look at stars as well as planets, but Christian Academy teacher felt that
planets would be more enjoyable for his students.
There were older people who were in their
late fifties at the Visitors Night as well. They
chatted warmly with the teacher from the
Christian Academy; there was a familial air to
the entire gathering. The shared wonder
seemed to make people more friendly. The
adults discussed Galielo and his fallout with
the Catholic Church while the teenagers chattered among themselves.
If you missed the Visitors Night this week, it
will also be held on October 14. On the second Tuesday of every month, an open house is
held at the observatory.
Another way to take advantage of the telescopes on campus is to reserve the observatory on your own by talking to Wulff Heintz,
an astronomy professor. Heintz, an expert on
binary stars, will take you into the observatory and show you how to operate the telescopes.

The poems dealt with serious topics, such as the pain involved in her

told of a character who, at 53, collected her gray hairs and let them
fly out on the wind every night so
that the birds could build their nests

from them. Her husband thinksthat
it's silly, and so she stops for a
while, but then begins her collection again. In the end, she brings
them out to the birds so they may
see what she has created, how each
hair is like a palpable tear. The final lines poignantly connect this
tale to the issues of being at the
middle of your life, having created
so many silver hairs and desiring
that they can continue after you are
gone.
The presentation left me with a
feeling of calm, because Olds' per-

spective on life was extremely per- '■>
ceptive and reassuring. I encour->
age everyone to read some of her/
work, to have a taste of the hoW-.
esty, plainness of language, and
strength of voice that is possible in
poetry. Also, be sure to keep an eye
out for upcoming events at The
Painted Bride, since it is a comparatively intimate and inexpensive
venue, dedicated to allowing art of
all forms to come to life. The readings by Major Jackson and Sharon
Olds were part of the Bride's "Living Word" series.

Sharpies II could possible have been a pool
of olden times that mysteriously burned down
from SHARPLES 11,A5

Chuck Norris whips out the big guns while singlehandedly saving the United States of America. Chuck
does what he has to do to the the job done.

unravel the Sharpies Enigma
once and for all.
A quick look at a Chronological
List of Swarthmore Building Acquisitions asked more questions
than it answered. There were two
references to a Sharpies Swimming
Pool, and one of the references says
that the Sharpies Swimming Pool
was destroyed by fire in 1965,
while the other claims it was demolished in 1988. But there's nothing in the book refering to any
building as Sharpies 11. Could the

Sharpies Swimming Pool be the
object ofmy search? Or is it a ruse,
concocted by the administration to
cover the existence of the 'real'
Sharpies II? I needed to find out.
So, working from an Artist's rendition of what Sharpies II could be
(above), I took an aerial survey of
campus to make sure there's nothing I was missing. But Sharpies II
still didn't turn up.
In desperation, I went to the Friends
Historical Library (a greatresource, by
the way) where Mary Ellen Chijioke
offered to solve the mystery.
After pointing out that everyone

on campus mispronounces
Sharpies—it should be 'Sharpless'—she said that the lodges located near the Sharpies Dining Hall
are supposed to be "The Sharpies
Lodges," probably just because of
their proximity to the Dining Hall.
All of them were frat houses when
originally constructed.
Stunningly, the Dining Hall isn't
Sharpies I, as I had previously thought,
but, instead, Sharpies I would be one
ofthe lodges, as would be Sharpies
11-IV. The other buildings, of
course, are known by other names,
and the ownership of the DU house

has not reverted to the College yet,
so it can't technically be counted
as one of the Sharpies lodges.
While I'm thankful to Mary Ellen<
for this information, the overall
vagueness of the answer, coupled
with
the
rampant
mispronounciation of its name and
the 'missing' Sharpies Swimming
Pool, all make me suspicious that, a,
massive cover-up was initiated to
disguise the original location and
true intent of the Sharpies II buikU
ing. Anyone who has information
on this can come forward by emailing phoenix@swarthmore.edu.

Denmark: not as rotten as
you would think
50's with four children to be married are
called into question. You are obliged to
reshape your notions of your world and
your place within its suddenly unstable
boundaries. One might call it culture
shock.
By giving it this label, one obscures the
highly individual nature of a dynamic process of encounter and interpretation. For
example, during a paper presentation seminar for my marine ecology course in Denmark, a student was questioned about the
validity of his sources by my professor, to
which he replied with something like "Oh,
you know, some people will do anything
just to get published. It's kinda hard. Look
how long you have been trying". It would
have been easy to attribute my amazement
with this level of familiarity and jocularity
that is acceptable between students and
teachers in Denmark to culture shock.
Rubber-stamping my reaction as culture
shock might have prevented me from examining in more depth the source of my
response to this situation, which I believe
is rooted in the relative formality of teacher/
student relations at Swarthmore.
Have you ever met an 18-year old Austrian shoemaker leaving her family in
search of an apprenticeship in Venice at
Sharpies dinner? I have not, but I ran into
one in Europe. Everything seemed possible when I was living in Denmark. A
Friday afternoon without classes became
a weekend trip to the Czech Republic or
an overnight train ride to Oslo. No moment was left unfilled, whether it be with a
celebration of the Queen's birthday at

from DENMARK.AS
minute train ride into the city followed by
a 10 minute walk from the main station in
order to reach the DiS headquarters. My
biology classes took place outside of a town
called Roskilde, a 20 minute trainride from
Vanlose. This commute required switching lines in the town of Valby, followed by
a 2 km walk to the classroom building. An
average day in Denmark involved at least
an hour and a half in transit, and compared
with other DiS students, I lived relatively
close to the center city.
This was a completely different game of
numbers than the one I play every morning at Swarthmore. No longer was nine
minutes sufficient for me to arrive at class
on time. "Snoozing" was no longer a viable option unless I wanted to set my alarm
for 5 a.m. Imagine requiring a time investment of an hour if you accidently forgot
the add/drop form at home that must be
turned in by noon that day? Imagine sitting on a train every morning deciphering
advertisements you cannot read and listening to hushed conversations you cannot
understand? Imagine not being able to
speak the same language as the person who
makes your grilled sandwich in Tarble?
What would make me, or any Swarthmore
student, abandon the ease and familiarity
of our cozy community and daily lives for
the proverbial "great unknown"?
Making the decision to study abroad and
following through with that resolution is a
bold endeavor. Even assumptions as seemingly basic as expecting a couple in their

Top Ten

Sharpies:

Jen Gross-

Prince Hamlef s castle.
Amalienborg Palace, an afternoon at the
Hall of Viking Ships, a school-sanctioned
field trip to the Carlsberg Brewery, or wonderful nights of dancing and skal (Danish
for 'cheers') in downtown Copenhagen
with friends from across the world.
People choose to study abroad and to
travel for many different reasons, ranging
from a desire to "experience the world" to
a need to escape from unhappy social/academic situations. Yet unless you spend
your entire experience abroad holed up in

your room consuming American novels or
in a computer lab trying to remain connected to Swat life via e-mail, I think it is
fair to assert that every individual who
elects to study abroad is forced to undergo
this process of confrontation and change.
I posed the question earlier as to why a student would willingly abandon that which
is comfortable and understood for the unknown. I believe that it is for the allure of
the prospect of transformed dimensions, of
accelerated change itself.

What do these changes imply for a student returning to Swarthmore from Denmark, Nepal, or Madagascar? Is foreign
study an act that can only affect the individual involved? What does it mean for
the Swarthmore community to have a large
number of swollen-headed students wan
dering around who believe they have "seen
the world" and now, in spite of these experiences and their associated changes, are
confined once again to our slower-paced
corner of the world?

scored early in the game, playing
with great flow, strong defense, and
few turnovers. They managed to
take the lead 3-1, before the worried Venus team called a time out,
after which Swat's rhythm was disrupted. UPenn began to make
fewer turnovers, and be more aggressive on the defensive blocks,
eventually beating Swarthmore 13-6.

Offensive and defensive sides must both have strong

played well for the most part, the offense was shut

Up next for the Tide are the winless Muhlenberg

Men's

By Ingrid Spies

Cross country runners are every-

where, bounding up Parrish hill
while you sit outside Sharpies enjoying 'POTATO BAR', running
laps on the track while you trudge
back to ML, or cruising around the
dance floor at Paces Saturday night.
And while you are certainly aware
of their presence (Nevin Katz '99
apologizes to everyone he's run
over in the last two weeks), you
may be asking yourself, "are these
guys any good?" The answer, my
fellow Swatties, is: "Yes, they are."
Although there was no meet last
Saturday, on September 27, both
the mens and womens teams came
in first in our Conference at Allentown College against Allentown,
Muhlenburg, and Lebanon Valley.
If it weren't for Bowdoin,
Swarthmore would have come in
first overall.
Joko Agunloye 'Ol and Danielle
Wall '9B won the womens race, in
a smoking 19:55 and 19:57, respectively, while the next finishers were
minutes behind. Stellar freshman
harrier Alissa Parmelee braved the
hazards of the mud pit to finish in
21:05, and was followed immediately by Karen Lloyd 'OO (21:30)
and Sarah McClure 'OO (21:46).
Cristina Cardemil 'Ol (22:02) and
Sarah Howard '9B (23:25) rounded
out our top seven, followed by
freshmen Talia "Sunshine" Young
(24:00) and Vanessa "Energizer"
Agosto(24:l6).
In the mens race, sophomore Jeff
Doyan led the Swarthmore Pack,
showing amazing talentfor his first
collegiate cross country season
with a time of 28:40. Veteran seniors Phil Jones '9B (28:50), Graham "Bubbles"Lucks '9B (29:18)
and Wyn Strodtbeck '9B (29:46)
flew up the hill to the finish, along
with cyberfrosh Mark Nierman
(29:15) and cybersoph Derek
Bruzewicz (29:23). The future
legacy of the team, freshmen
Ambrose"Jailbird" Dieringer
(30:57), Dan "imal" Schwartz
(31:09), Ari "Intramural" Houser
'Ol (33:27), and Seth "Iron" Steed
'Ol (35:49), showed their thirst for
blood by mercilessly picking off the
hapless competition in the last mile.
Gene Yoshida '99 molested the
course and finished in a feverish
32:15, with Nevin "Nevcat" Katz
*99 (33:07) and Jeff Lockman '9B
(33:38) following close behind.
Supplemented by a steady
diet of repeat miles prescribed by
"Dr. Coach" Ted Dixon, the cross
country teams prepare to smother
the competition at the Dickinson

Field hockey rises in regional poll

Jean Quinn

The Garnet notched a big win
over Dickinson last weekend, but
fell to Washington College, 2-1,
Tuesday in a tight contest. The loss
snapped a twenty-two game Centennial Conference win streak that
began two seasons ago. The Garnet are now 11-1 overall, 4-1 in the
conference.
The team traveled to Dickinson Saturday and routed the Diplomats, 5-0.
The offense was well-balanced with
five players picking up points in the
match. Danielle Duffy '9B scored two
goals and two assists. Lurah Hess '99
scored twice, and Jen Hagan '99 once.
Holly Baker '99 picked up a trio of assists, and Kristen English 'Ol earned
one as well.
"Dickinson was a good team but

we had more stick skill and more
speed," said Coach Karen Borbee.
"They tried to play us with a different strategy than anyone we had
faced this season. It worked for a
while, but as soon as we adjusted,
we took control."
Defender Lynne Steuerle '99
commented on the Garnet's performance. "We did not have our best
game, possibly because of the poor
condition of their field. It made it
difficult for us to play our fast run
and hit game when the grass was
so long."
Borbee praised the team's ability
to adapt to the opponent's style and
still come out on top. "I was impressed with our ability to adjust
our style of play to Dickinson's
slow field and to their strategy to
pack it in front of the goal and back

off in the midfield. I has happy to
see we could maintain the level of
our game and still adapt to what
was happening on the field," she
said.
Unfortunately, the team lost the
offensive power of forward Hess in
the second half, likely for the remainder of the season. Hess believes the bone in her left hand,
beneath the pinky, is broken
While she has played with broken
fingers and splints before, the position of the injury and the placement of the cast which it will most
probably require prevents her from
gripping the stick and playing.
This win, following the team's
stellar performance at the Seven
Sisters' Tournament, helped the
Garnet move up a spot in regional
rankings. Swarthmore bumped
.

Montclair State out of the fourth
position.
On Tuesday, the Garnet lost to
Washington College, 2-1. Baker
scored Swat's only goal, the first
of the game. The Bullets tied the
game on a penalty stroke in the first
half and scored again to put them
in the lead for good. Players noted
that the field, in contrast to the
grassy, slow conditions in the game
against Dickinson, was exceptionally fast. The defeat is the first conference loss for the Garnet in a
while. The Garnet went undefeated
in the Centennial Conference in
1995 and 1996, the years of their
conference championships.
The Garnet have almost a week
off. They next take the field Sunday Oct. 12,when they host Ithaca,
the top-ranked team in the region.

The Garnet Tide's record fell to

Ursinus. The Bears defense dominated the game, limiting
Swarthmore to minus 1 yard rushing, and 92 total yards.
With hopes of defeating the defending conference champions,
Swarthmore jumped out early and

didn't send anybody [to nationals], t
but this year hopefully we'lLdo
some damage."
This tournament was their third
and last of the season, following the
Bloomsberg Invitational and Tim
Berman Invitational earlier this fall.
The fall season ended with ihe
Rolex tournament, and nownhe
players are responsible for training
on their own before the spring season starts after winter break. Tly, ,
main goal for the fall, according V*
John Leary, is "to get a lot ofexperience and play matches. We're
looking tight for the spring season."
When spring starts, the team will
get ready for their first matches
against U.Penn and Colombia in
late February and early March.
On another note, the women's
team has their last tournament, the
Capitol Classic, this weekend in
College Park, Maryland.

Realizing they were down by

themselves at the half. "We were

But the Bears running game finally wore down the defense, and
an early third quarter touchdown

Though the defense played a

Women's ruggers bulldoze U. of Delaware
By

Amber

Halsey

Last Saturday, the Swarthmore women
ruggers battled the University ofDelaware
in their second division match of the season. The A-side squad defeated their worthy opponent by a score of 7-0, while the
B-side team matched U Del's second side
with a final score of 14-14.
Swat's A-side team dominated the field
for the full 70 action packed minutes. The
only try of the game was scored in the second half by both Alexa Miller 'OO and
Meghan Brennan 'OO after a series of intense scrum downs only 5 meters from
Swat's try zone. With Sarah Cross '99 playing at loose head prop once again, the
undefeatable duo of Cross and Becky
Snyder '9B proved to be an intimidating
pair for the Delaware forwards. Joan

Hoffman '9B, the veteran second row,
played an amazing game despite severe illness; Hoffman, along with her trusty sidekick Mary McGuire 'OO drove the A-side
scrum over the opposition throughout the
game.
The back line players proved once again
to be the quickest ruggers on the field with
Kira Cochran-Bond 'OO and Beth Vose '99
sidestepping tackles in order to move the
ball continuously up the field. Emily
Wilkins' 'Ol foot proved to be a valuable
addition for the A-side squad, kicking the
conversion in the game, and scoring two
more points for the home team.
The B-side squad once again showed
improvement above and beyond even
CoachAlan Matas' wildest dreams. Rhiana
Swartz 'OO scored all 14 points of the game,
placing the ball on the ground in the try

zone twice and kicking both conversion
kicks as well. Swartz was driven into the
try zone by rookie powerhouses Marisa
Chavez 'Ol and Ariana Freeman 'Ol.
Sandra Albro 'Ol and Sandra Schrauf '9B,
a.k.a. Sandra squared, both played at second row, aiding in the B-side scrum's domination of their weaker opponent.
The B-side back line consisting of Noelle
Goodin 'OO, Ursula Lang 'Ol, Erika Anderson 'Ol, and Morgan Kelly '9B outsmarted
the Delaware line, who was left in the dust
after the powerful kicks of fullback Cathy
Vaughan 'Ol.
With the U Del victory under their belts,
the Swarthmore team has one more division game to face in order to qualify for
EPRU championships. Come support the
toughest women on campus this Saturday
at 11:00am on Dupont field.
