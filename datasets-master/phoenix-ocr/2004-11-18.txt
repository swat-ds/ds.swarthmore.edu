Stomach virus
infects campus
BY BEN OLDFIELD

boldfiel@swarthmore.edu

In addition to the colds and sore throats that are all too
common this time of year, an outbreak of a flu-like virus
has infected many students in the college's larger dorms.
For the past two weeks, the Worth Health Center staff has
been busier than usual as they accommodate overnight
visits by students who are afflicted with the virus.
According to Eileen Stasiunas, a Worth nurse, all
seven of Worth's beds were full on the night of Saturday,
Nov. 6, and more students have come in since then.
"I can't say I turned anyone away," Stasiunas said,
explaining she would have allowed students to sleep in
the waiting room if they wanted. "But those students suffering from dehydration took priority."

Although more aggressive than the average colds that
seem to characterize this time of year, the virus and its
effects are unrelated to the campus's shortage of the flu
vaccination.
"We're not talking about the flu," Worth Director
Linda Echols said. "It's just a gastro-intestinal virus
that's going around." Nearby schools have been plagued
by a similar virus, Echols added.

Panelists discuss the staff wage proposal, which was chosen by faculty, at a discussion hosted by the Swarthmore
Living Wage and Democracy Campaign on Tuesday.

Faculty choose staff
compensation proposal
BY BENJAMIN BRADLOW AND
RICHARD MUI
bbradlol@swarthmore.edu and
rmuil@swarthmore.edu
In a
closed meeting last
Wednesday with College President
Al Bloom, faculty members voted on
a proposal for staff benefits that
Bloom presented to them.
He offered two different staff benefits packages, with the primary differences between the two concerning the dollar amount of the minimum wage and the extent of health

care benefits.
The first package included an
hourly minimum wage of $10.38 and
the continuation of the benefit bank,
which would amount to another 88
cents in hourly wages to be used for
health or childcare benefit packages.

According to Bloom's written
proposal, this would meet the faculty Ad Hoc committee's calculations
on a living wage of $11.26 taking into
account inflation over the two years.
This proposal would include a subsidy to cover health insurance costs
for partners or spouses of employees, based on means testing. The college would also help employees qualify for health insurance for their
children under the CHIP program.
The second package would establish an hourly minimum wage of
$11.26, while keeping the benefit
bank intact. Besides the wage difference, the primary variation between
the two proposals is that the second

THE PHOENIX

package would not include health

coverage for workers' spouses or
partners.
Faculty at the meeting voted 40-6
for the first package with one
abstention.
According to political science
professor Ken Sharpe, the vote "was
a sign of unity" and "pragmatic"
political decision-making. Along
with several dozen other faculty
members, Sharpe has been active in
a de facto Living Wage faculty committee in recent dialogue with the

President.

"I believe [Bloom] when
he says that this is the
best we can do. It will
make for real change."
Barry Schwartz
psychology professor
Bloom saw the proposal as a feasible compromise between various
competing interests affecting a final
staff compensation package.
"The proposal represents a good
balance among institutional values,
objectives and constraints. Not
including funds for staff professional development, the maximum cost
is likely to be $130,000 a year,
depending on how many people
qualify," Bloom said.

"Students were all over the place
here because we had two different
sicknesses to deal with the
[gastro-intestinal] virus plus the
fevers and sore throats."
Linda Echols
director of Worth Health Center

According to psychology profes-

sor Barry Schwartz, 40 to 50 faculty
members have signed a letter to the
board in support of the Ad Hoc
Committee's original proposal and
are trying to work with Bloom with
increasing success.
"Now is the latest stage of a very
complex process. Looking for a compromise that the lowest paid, the
higher earning staff, students, faculty,
and the board

will accept, Bloom has
shown a statesman-like effort to pull
everything together," Sharpe said.

Schwartz

argued that the facul-

ty's influence on decisions about
staff compensation is limited. "The
faculty discussion and vote has no
force; [Bloom] is forced with making
a decision. He is informed of the faculty's decision, but is under no obligation to act that way," he said.
Faculty will vote tomorrow on
the final proposal that Bloom will
present to the Board of Managers at
their next meeting on Dec. 3 and 4.
Though Bloom has discussed previous proposals with the Board, next
month's meeting will be the first the
board will actually vote on a specific

proposal.

Schwartz is generally satisfied
with Bloom's latest proposal. "With
a couple of tweaks, I am ready to
accept the latest proposal. It is not
ideal, but shows real progress. I
believe [Bloom] when he says that
this is the best we can do. It will
make for real change," he said.
See LIVING WAGE, pg. 7
November 18, 2004

Symptoms for the virus include fever, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. The bug "would pass through the sys-

tem in 24 hours," Echols said.
Echols was originally worried that the virus might be
related to food poisoning, but she now believes otherwise.
"We had some sick students write out what they'd eaten,
and there weren't any patterns," she said. "Also, some of
the first students who got sick had been away for the
weekend."
According to Stasiunas, diarrhea was treated with
Pepto Bismol, and Compazine was prescribed to ease the

nausea and vomiting.
"The really sick students were able to join the world
again after a night with us," Echols said. "Our job was to
make sure they had enough fluid and sustenance once
they were able to keep their food down."
Although the outbreak was larger than those in past
years, the virus did not break any records. "I don't think
we've had as bad a spell in two or three years," said
Echols. "But we've seen worse."

Dealing with the stomach bug, however, took much of
Worth's attention away from caring for patients with
fevers, sore throats and colds, which are common afflictions for this time of year. "Students were all over the
place here because we had two different sicknesses to deal
with
the GI virus plus the fevers and sore throats,"

Echols said.

The bigger dorms, especially Mertz and Willets, were
the hardest-hit by the illness. According to Mertz
Residential Assistant Sarah Goldberg 'O5, two students on
her hall contracted the stomach virus and others have
had fevers. In addition, a group of Mertz first-years took a
trip to a student's home in New York and all came home
ill. "Even the student's mother got sick," Goldberg said.
Residents of Willets basement have also suffered from
the virus. RA John Egan 'O6 said at least three students
had the stomach bug. "We had three or four who were
sick, and a couple of them had to go to Worth," he said.
"But what can you expect of Willets basement?"

WSRN to seek outside technical help
Station faced with broadcasting problems following its move to Parrish North
BY IVAN BOOTHE
iboothel@swarthmore.edu
After a semester marred by
broadcasting problems, the student radio station will be asking
the college administration to
fund the employment of a parttime, professional engineer to

address future issues.

"We haven't known what
we're doing at all," WSRN
General Manager Alex Flurie 'O5
said. "Only a few of us are electrical engineers, and none of us
are broadcast engineers."
No sound was being broadcast
when the station first went up
this semester, due to a mistake
by student workers. The problem
was not noticed or fixed for a

week.

"A professional engineer
would be much better for making
minor repairs, maintaining the
studio, and making recommendations for parts to buy for the studio," Mark Handler 'O5, the programming director and chief
engineer, said.
While the student engineer
would "likely still be the first
contact and will fix what he or
she can," Handler said a professional was necessary for some
tasks.
The station had expected to
move over the summer from
their former offices at the top
floor of Parrish, now under renovation, to Parrish North, but

Flurie said he had been "overly
idealistic" about the move and
had not budgeted enough time.
Susan Sayer, campus planner
and project manager for the
Parrish renovation, agreed with

this assessment.
"Last spring we met with
WSRN, but [we] had a lot of difficulty getting WSRN staff to focus

on things like packing and figuring out what they needed to
move," she said. "As a result,
they had to take time this fall to
get things working." The station

did not begin broadcasting until

Nov. L

"The administration
doesn't know we're
drowning."
Alex Flurie 'O5
WSRN General
Manager
"Part of the problem was that
there was very old technology
upstairs that we had to gut out,"
Flurie said, referring to the studios that had been installed in
1970. "The new studio is built
completely from scratch."
Andrew Fieldhouse 'OB, a firstyear disc jockey, said the space
was "dirty and disorganized."

While he said the WSRN staff had
put "no pressure at all" on DJs,
he said he was "definitely not
prepared" at the beginning of the

semester.
In 2001, WSRN adopted a policy of DJ training that included
system operations, procedures to
fix basic problems and an

Communications Commission
rules of broadcasting. This year
the training focused only on
operating the equipment
and
with more than 100 student DJs,
many could not see the procedures the staff were outlining.
"Training was very, very minimal," Fieldhouse said. "I had
probably five minutes of dead air
the first time I broadcast."
Flurie said the station's temporary space in Parrish North
was adequate, but that "conditions were pretty poor."
Until late in the semester, he
said, "there was debris in my
library space; rooms that I was
promised would be finished were
delayed; rooms that were finished were covered in dust,
which is terrible for broadcast
equipment. So it's sufficient, but
definitely not great."
Peter Gardner 'OB, a late-night
DJ, said "everything seems to
work, it's just a little ram-

shackle."

"It's not a very nice setting to
sit in a little room with dust,"
said Alyssa Van Thoen 'OB,
another DJ. "My biggest problem
is the dust."
"The biggest problem with the
space is the access door, which
should always be unlocked.
Unfortunately, it hasn't been,"
Handler said in an e-mail.
Sayer said she had never been
contacted about any problems
with the facilities.
"If I'd heard of it I would have
done something. We have a lot of
construction going on around
them, and we certainly do apologize for any inconveniences," she
said. "But I need to be made
aware of problems before I can
do anything about them. I
haven't had any e-mail correspondence from WSRN about

this problem."

Flurie acknowledged
that
there had been a breakdown in
communication between the station and the administration, but
that it rested partly with the col-

lege. "The administration has
gotten out of touch with us," he

said. "The administration doesn't know we're drowning."
Flurie said the station was
"not consulted about the floor
plan" for the top floor of Parrish.
"I didn't have any input on the
old space. They got rid of our
engineer's room. They got rid of
the second studio that was our
real radio studio."

Until late in the semester, debris covered the library area and some
rooms still unfinished in the new WSRN studios in Parrish North.

"A great deal of

vice president
"Sayer hasn't been keeping in
contact with me
but I've been
bad about talking with her, too,"

Flurie said.

Larry Schall '75, vice president for facilities and chair of the
renovation committee, declined
to comment for this article.
"A great deal of communication must be developed between
the radio station and the administration,"
Vice
President
Maurice Eldridge '6l said in an email.
Flurie said the move and subsequent problems has "been a
wake-up call that we need some
serious help." Whereas in earlier
years the station could rely on
student engineering expertise,

"we do not have the personnel to
support our radio station now,"
he said.
Flurie said he also realized
that WSRN was not the same
radio station it used to be.
When the station began in
1940, it focused on classical
music and radio theater. In the
1950s WSRN had a flourishing
news department broadcasting
and recording campus events
and speakers
instrumental, for
instance, in covering the 1969
admissions crisis and death of
the college president.
With the advent of MTV and
explosion of commercial radio in
the 1980s and 19905, WSRN's relevance to many students began to
decline. The station stopped
employing interns from Strath
Haven High School in the early
19905, and cut the news department after a 1997 survey indicated few students listened to the
reports.
"Swarthmore is a different
place than in the 19505," Flurie
said. "It's a completely different
group of people now; we just
don't have the time. I've realized
we can't be the same station we
once were."
Many DJs were skeptical,
after repeated problems with
broadcasting online and over the
airwaves, that many students
were still paying attention.
"I feel like nobody's listening," Stephanie Hsu 'OB said.
"We have not been as professional as we could be," Flurie
admitted. "We need somebody
who can get us back on track
technically."
Despite the problems, Flurie
said he felt that broadcasting this
year was the right decision.
"Knowing all that has happened, I probably still would
have moved the station," he said.
"But I say yes reluctantly."

Congressman kicks off lecture series
BY AARON WASSERMAN

awasserl@swarthmore.edu

Congressman Peter Deutsch '79, U.S. Representative of
Florida's 20th district, started off the "Heard on the Hill"
lecture series Monday night, providing a history of his
political career and a critique of John Kerry's presidential

campaign.
Following

a brief, humorous retrospective of his under-

graduate life at Swarthmore and his initial forays into politics, Deutsch conducted a lengthy, informal question-and-

answer session with the audience. He offered details about
his campaigns and his work as a member of the Florida
House of Representatives and the U.S. House of

minority voice in the Senate, saying it "can still affect the

Senate seat vacated by Democrat Bob Graham.
Deutsch lost the Democratic nomination to Betty Castor,
who was then defeated by the Republican candidate, Mel
Martinez. The congressman self-effacingly described his
campaign in the primary as "Okay, not great," but still contended that he was the better candidate than Castor. He
attributed the loss to several unhelpful "long passes" in the
race's last few weeks: debuting negative advertisements
and enlisting the support ofRev. Jesse Jackson and Rev. Al
Sharpton, along with a substantial fundraising and name

recognition disadvantage.

Deutsch offered searing critiques of Sen. John Kerry's
unsuccessful presidential campaign. He said that Kerry's
inability to connect personally with most voters was the
reason he lost the election. He added that Kerry and his
advisors did not want to hold themselves responsible, so
they shifted the blame to the much-publicized "morals"
issue.
"America, on Election Day, didn't know who John Kerry
was. America had made a collective decision to fire George
Bush, but on the personal level, Kerry didn't close the sale,"
Deutsch said. "I'm not sure Kerry knew why he was running for president."
"There's been a systematic attempt on the highest institutional level by Republicans to demonize Democrats,"
making elections an "us versus them situation, which
Kerry fed into," Deutsch said. Kerry failed to define policy
issues on his terms, according to Deutsch.
The congressman was bitterly optimistic about the
results of the recent elections. "The republic will survive
under Bush," Deutsch said. Later he added, "The political
alignment in the Senate and House isn't locked in yet."
Deutsch also mentioned that he felt the Democratic
Party's future lies in its ability to find candidates with the

he saw a new majority that elected him in '92. He created a
new coalition, but the tragedy is it wasn't sustainable

When asked what the Democrats in the House of

minority, Deutsch tersely replied "nothing."

outcome. Because it's a majority rule, the minority members have no effect," Deutsch said.

his congressional district and will leave office in January.
Earlier in the event, Deutsch highlighted the influence
of an American foreign policy course taught by political
science professor James Kurth in steering him towards a
political career. "The class revealed to me that the government actually affects things that I care about," he said.
Deutsch's career in Florida politics began in Broward
and Miami-Dade counties, because he "was looking for a
community that was growing exponentially and where
there was a sizeable Jewish community." He moved to the
federal government in 1992 when he won an open congressional seat.
The lecture was the first of several events in the "Heard
on the Hill" series, which invites alumni and regional
politicians to campus to talk about their experiences as
congressmen. Doru Gavril 'O5 is organizing the series with
support from the President's Office, the political science
and economics departments and the public policy program.
Gavril was inspired to organize the series after several
positions as a legislative intern for both congressional
houses. "On Capitol Hill, I found a completely different
that is to say,
approach to politics than in the classroom
practical legislative issues that aren't immediately transparent to us," Gavril said. "The series' goal is to emphasize
the fact these people have different perspectives, but ultimately, they're nowhere close to how the media demonize
elected officials. They're generally interested in policy outcomes."
"[The President's Office] responded to this emphasis [of
organizing the series], because I think there really are students interested in the possibilities of public service," Vice
President Maurice Eldridge '6l said. "We have alums

who've done it and who I think can help students get a picture of pathways [of getting involved in politics]."
Eldridge added that the series will be non-partisan, and
that funding was not much of a problem. "The funding
issues are minor because if [the politicians] are in office
they're not allowed to receive honorariums," Eldridge said.
The series continues on Nov. 29 with a lecture from
Democratic Sen. Carl Levin '56 of Michigan. Democratic
Rep. Robert A. Brady of the Ist District of Pennsylvania,
the district in which Swarthmore is represented, will also
be participating in the series.

Vandalized lampposts leave Magill Walk in darkness
BY NICOLE KAST

nkastl@swarthmore.edu

Five lampposts on Magill Walk have
been destroyed since the beginning of the
semester, leaving the entire walk near
Sharpies in darkness.
No one is sure why the posts were targeted or who the culprits are, but their
destruction has left Facilities and Public
Safety the task of investigation and replacement. The damaged lampposts signal a new
wave of vandalism plaguing campus.
In the past, when similar acts of vandalism have been committed, the tops of the
lampposts were destroyed, according to
Maintenance Supervisor Bill Maguire. This
time, however, each lamppost was disconnected from its base and thrown to the
ground. Generally, Swarthmore has a couple lampposts vandalized each year, but not
usually to this extent or this early.
On Sept. 12, Public Safety officers noticed
people, identified as three males, running
from a fallen lamppost. The individuals
were pursued but not apprehended.
However, even that evidence is insubstantial since no one was seen actually taking
down a lamppost, Director of Public Safety
Owen Redgrave said.
When the lampposts first started being
vandalized in September, Facilities was

THE

PHOENIX

immediately notified and began reinstallation, which has proven difficult. Only one of

the five lampposts, which was made of
metal, endured the fall and could be reinstalled. The other four were made of fiberglass, and the shock of the fall was more

devastating.
"When [the lamppost]

hit the ground, the
glue broke and the pole itselfbroke because
it was fiberglass," Maguire said.
Public Safety does not see the darkness
as a major safety hazard. "While it is a little
unusual that we've had this many lampposts down in one particular area, there is
still ambient light, and it's not like total
darkness," Redgrave said. In any case,
Public Safety is being particularly diligent
in monitoring the area. At present, auxiliary officers are patrolling the area on foot
from 9 p.m. until 3:30 a.m. every night,
according to Redgrave.
One additional problem is the older style
of the lampposts on Magill Walk, a style that
is no longer manufactured. Facilities
intends to buy new lampposts, probably in
the same style as those currently around
Parrish and Tarble. But before new lampposts are purchased, the proposal must be
approved in the capital budget for next year.
The lampposts cost between $4,500 to $5,000
a piece, according to Maguire, who was confident that the proposal would be approved

by the Board of Managers.
The decision regarding the purchase of
the lampposts will not be made until next
year. Since Facilities has only one spare
lamppost, until then, one replacement will
have to suffice. "The plan is to put one up to
have enough light on Magill Walk. We're
going to have it strategically placed so there
won't be a big block of darkness," said

Maguire.
Both Maguire and Redgrave said that the
real danger lies in the electrical hazard.
When the lampposts are working they have
an electrical power of 480 volts, certainly
enough energy to severely harm someone
when taken down.
Most students feel fairly safe walking on
Magill Walk, even without the additional
light. "I feel about as safe as anyone can feel
when they're walking late at night in the
dark," Anna Gonzalez 'OB said.
Others were more concerned with the
vandalism itself. "I think it's really stupid,
and I wonder why someone would do something like that. It clearly took a lot of effort,
which is confusing," Anand Vaidya 'O5 said.
"I feel like that kind of thing is kind of uselessly destructive," Peter Yang 'O6 said.
Maguire agreed. "[The lampposts] are

SEPTA may hike fares due to deficit
BY BREE BANG-JENSEN

bbangjel@swarthmore.edu
Students may have to shell
out an extra $3.50 for their weekend trips to Philly starting next
semester.
Due to a $62 million deficit for
fiscal year 2005, SEPTA is considering drastic measures to cover
their operating budget, according
to Jim Whittaker, who is in charge
of media relations for SEPTA.
These measures would include
cutting service by about 20 percent, increasing fares by 25 percent, and laying off 1,400 SEPTA
employees. On the R3 line, which
provides service to Swarthmore,
the one-way off-peak fare to central Philadelphia would increase
from $3.75 to $5.50 each way.
According to a recent press
release, the service cuts would
eliminate 20 percent of regional

rail trips, particularly the trips

after 8 p.m. and the midday trips
often used by students.
The Savetransit Coalition, a
group of businesses and individuals affected by these cuts, is trying
to determine a solution before
SEPTA must resort to this contingency plan.
According to a Savetransit representative e-mail, "325,000 work-

ers in Greater Philadelphia, the
65,000 middle, high school, and college students, the 90,000 senior citizens, and the 89,500 Flower Show
attendees" will be affected by the
pending

measures.
Within the Swarthmore community, several departments and
organizations will be affected,

including the Education department, which sends students into
Philadelphia for observations, and
the Lang Center for Civic and
Social Responsibility.
The Lang Center is concerned
about the increase, especially in
light of their already tight trans-

portation budget.
"Up to now, we've had a policy
of supporting any student doing
community service in Philly, but
Budget
[Student
without
Committee] support... we will run
out of funds well before the end of
the academic year," Pat James,

associate director for student programs and training at the Lang
Center, said.

Swarthmore students who go
into Philadelphia on weekends are
also concerned about the increases.
"I'm having a hard time paying
for all my trips to Philly as things
are now," Sabrina Danielson 'O7,
who frequently takes the SEPTA
train to Philadelphia to see her

boyfriend, said.
Lisa Leary, a Springfield

com-

muter who takes the train into
from
Philadelphia
the

Swarthmore station five days a
week, was not surprised by the
potential increases. "I've lived in
this area for a while, and it was
pretty clear it was coming," she
said. "They can't make a profit on
what they charge and the government wasn't making up the difference."
Neither Leary nor Danielson
expects the charge to affect their
use of SEPTA trains. "I don't like
to drive," Leary said. "Traffic in
Philadelphia is already disgusting.
This is just going to make it
worse."
Savetransit
representatives
expect that the decreased service
will induce more people to use
their cars, resulting in "more traffic and increased air pollution."
The fare increase will also
affect subway fees. Under the contingency plan, token prices will
increase from $2 to $2.50.
"That really hurts," Danielson
said. "That's worse than the rail
increase. I think I use the subway
five or six times every time I'm in
Philly."
SEPTA's funds come from both
government subsidies and rev-

enue from the fare box. The deficit
has occurred because "subsidies
over the past eight to 10 years are
reduced, and are not often enough
to allow us to keep operating the
way we have," Whittaker said.
SEPTA hopes to avoid raising
fares and cut services. They have
asked the state for additional funding. They also hope the state will
agree to abide by a "funding formula" year after year, as inconsistencies and instability over the
last 10 years have made budgeting

Whittaker.
Savetransit is trying to pressure legislators to support the
funding increase, and urges concerned consumers to write to their
representatives in Harrisburg, the
state's capital, according to the

coalition's Web site.

"We hope to hear back by then.
If we don't receive an additional
subsidy, we'll have to implement
the contingency plan for next
year," Whittaker said.

NEWS IN BRIEF
Prospective students flock to campus for Discovery Weekend
Last weekend, 131 prospective students
attended Discovery Weekend, Swarthmore's
biggest on-campus recruiting program of the year.
The goal of the weekend is to attract potential
applicants of diverse ethnic backgrounds who
have demonstrated an interest in Swarthmore.
Events included a talent show, Mendhi Night,
dance workshops and movies. Students were also
given a list of classes they could attend on
Monday morning.
Prospective students had to apply to attend
Discovery Weekend, with the 131 students who
attended being chosen from a poof of 300 applicants. "We want to be sure that students who
attend are genuinely interested in Swarthmore.
Our peer institutions just fly in everyone, but we

don't want the opportunity to be taken by those
who know nothing about the college," Suzi Nam,
associate dean of admissions and director of multicultural recruitment, said.
Nam said that acceptance or denial for the
weekend does not indicate anything about the
decision to accept or reject an applicant for
matriculation at Swarthmore.
In the past, Discovery Weekend has shown a
high rate of success in encouraging its attendees
to apply to and enroll at Swarthmore.
According to Nam, of the 135 prospective students who attended the program in fall 2003,107
applied and 22 enrolled.

of the conversations I've had with staff it seems they'd prefer [the
second package]," he said. "It's sort of a paternalistic gesture."

Responding to speculation provoked by Phoenix columnist

Rachel Ackoff 'O7, who justified past examples of direct action, such
as sit-ins in the living wage campaign at Harvard University, in her
column last week, Gould-Werth did not deny that the campaign is
considering a sit-in, but said that nothing has been decided. "If it
looks politically necessary, we would do it," she said.
The campaign held a panel on Bloom's latest proposal on

Both Ross and Hartel lamented how polarizing the push for a living wage has been.
"I feel that it's been much more of a divisive process than I
would have liked it to be," Ross said.
Hartel echoed Ross and expressed hope that the Swarthmore
community could still rally around a living wage. "I hope that we
can come together on this issue," she said. "There's always talk, and
it finally seems like there's a light at the end of this road."
The relatively congenial atmosphere of the panel took a slightly
acrimonious turn during a question-and-answer session, as Pat
James, associate director for student programs at the Lang Center,
accused the faculty Ad Hoc Committee and student living wage
campaign of usurping a staff committee convened to evaluate staff
compensation at Swarthmore five years ago. "Students and faculty
highjacked the campaign," she said.
Professor of history Allison Dorsey countered that the staff committee had inadequate representation of important demographic
segments of the staff. "Race was an issue that was not being
addressed at those staff committee meetings
There was an
absence of voices of some of the staff, in particular, the lowest paid
staff," she said.
The staff committee consisted of representatives from administrative staff, program management staff, Dining Services and
Environmental Services, according to James. "Probably if we'd
done proportional representation we would have gotten a different
number," she said.
At a closed meeting between Bloom and staff members yesterday, Bloom talked about his plans for presenting a staff compensation package to the board, according to Associate Vice President for
Human Resources Melanie Young. "He talked about what he's
thinking about presenting to the board," she said. "He reported on
how his thinking has evolved on the issue."
According to Young, staff members aired concerns at the meeting about the details of the CHIP program, what resources would
be dedicated to staff development, health care packages, and
specifics of the as-yet-unspecified means testing program. In addition, meeting attendees discussed whether staff who would stand
to receive a higher wage would lose eligibility for Section 8, low-

At a Student Council-sponsored town hall meeting last night, stu-

like that I was gone. "The Poenis has

Read that again. "Alex LeaderSmith does not exist." For 19 years,
I'd lived a lie, fooled into accepting
the reality of my existence. This was
an identity crisis of the highest magnitude. Cogito, sed non sum? How
could that possibly be? I needed to

investigate.

Initial results confirmed the proexistence hypothesis. The phone
directory listed me. Credit card bills
were sent to me. My school and state
IDs were proof not only of my identity, but of my dashing good looks as
well. With the evidence so strongly in my favor, there was only one thing
to do: confront The Poenis with their blatantly incorrect "correction." I
mean, if there's one thing I've learned at Swarthmore, it's how to angrily
dispute perceived slander.
I fired off an e-mail to editors John Williams 'O6 and Michelle Crouch
'O6, asking to share my findings. John's succinct reply: "You're welcome
to [attend a meeting], but you need to bring some brownies." Fair enough.
I love baked goods, but trading them for a chance to prove my existence
seemed like a reasonable exchange.

The Prodigal Prodigy

We began by dissecting Joe's inability to
communicate with his mother. We ended
contemplating life-size cardboard cutouts of
Joe Alberti 'O6.
A quick Genuardi's run later, I was in the Publications Office, surrounded by Poenis (a.k.a. Spike) staffers. They were a motley crew,
ranging from Joe "Champion of the Mustachioed" Kille 'O6 to Lindsey
"Layout Dominatrix" Brin 'O5 to a cardboard cutout of Han Solo ('08?)
that sat next to John and stoically watched over us. I'd soon learn all
their quirky personalities
Joe, for instance, was brash and unapologetic, while Han was rather stiff— but right then they formed a chorus
of assent: "Brownies?! You really brought brownies?! Do you want to
join us? Write for us? Please?" I was taken aback. An invitation to join
them already? Wow. If that wasn't acceptance of my existence, I don't
know what is.
Flattered by their praise, I decided to stay through the meeting. It
was like an hour spent trapped in a Dali painting. We began by dissecting Joe's inability to communicate with his mother. We ended contemplating life-size cardboard cutouts of Joe Alberti 'O6. In between, we pondered Polish accents, "beer spheres," and the legality of necrophilia in
New Jersey. There was a huge debate over Mustache November that
seemed to stem entirely from Kille's mustache fetish. I wanted to inject

some comment about bearded ladies and the masculonormatization of
facial hair, but I feared losing touch with reality even further.
to discuss
Eventually, we struck an uncertain accord and moved on
lesbian killef nurses, I believe.
And so it went, a mind-numbing phantasmagoria of genuine absurdity. I had entered uncertain of my own existence. I left uncertain of
Spike's. I'd get caught up in a debate over obscene band names, then
step back, confused: "Wait, is this an article? Is this? Is that?"
Meanwhile, Joe was shouting, "Don't try to sully this meeting with your
silly magazine!" while Michelle earnestly thanked me for providing
motivation. Spike's confusion over my existence no longer seemed odd
to me. I left, just happy they'd figured out who I was.
In all honesty, though, it was a good experience. I had some fun,
proved my existence, and got to charge $5 in brownies to The Phoenix
expense account. I almost couldn't ask for more
except one tiny thing.
I could still use a niche.
I might have an existence, but I'm still lacking an identity. Perhaps
THAT was the philosophical message The Poenis was trying to send. If
a man has no club, is he truly a man? Is he real? Does he exist? Am I but
a facade? Should I take more philosophy courses? Next semester I'll find
out for sure. Next semester, come hell or high water, I'm finding myself
a home.

'Tis the season for music
BY MICHELLE KIM

"A pleasant surprise is waiting for you
under the next Bush administration." No, this
isn't Jay Leno's latest attempt at a hilariously
outrageous show-opener; it was one of several
fortune cookie fortunes director John Alston
shared with a full house at the Jazz Ensemble
concert on Saturday night. Thanks to Alston,
when the crowd was not delighting in the rich
and often-improvised music, they were laughing
at his off-the-cuff jokes and dry humor.

"It was awesome
The
atmosphere was relaxed with

Jonathan Harris 'OB
....

Though the program included popular standards like Duke Ellington's "'A' Train," the
evening was particularly noteworthy for its
many improvised solos, especially since every
member of the ensemble had at least one. "That's
what jazz is really all about," Alston said.
Although the musicians made it look easy,
plenty of work, talent and nerves went into making the show a success. This dedication will
serve the Ensemble well for the rest of the year
as they practice for future concerts. But this
time, hours of practice didn't alleviate everyone's nerves.
"I was kind of nervous because there was a
lot more improv, but it all came together in the
end," guitarist Adam Hunt 'O6 said.
Caleb Ward 'O7, who played a duet on saxo-

phone with Alston on the piano, was also
pleased. "When you're having fun, good things
happen," he said. The audience agreed

'OB said. "The exit was amazing, Xan's [Fishman

definitely funny, and on the whole, the atmosphere was relaxed with good music." So good, in
fact, that the whole house came to its feet at the
end.

As the semester draws to a close and music

groups prepare to showcase their months of
work, it's not just the Jazz Ensemble who's
showing off their stuff. On the Friday before the
Jazz Ensemble concert, Swarthmore's Wind

Ensemble set the standard for a season of fine

music.
Directed by Michael Johns, the Wind
Ensemble began the string of performances with

a solid concert in front of a sizable audience and
undeterred by the pouring rain.
With an audience of Bryn Mawr and
Swarthmore students, Swarthmore alumni and
guest artists, the Ensemble engaged listeners
with an explosive rendition of "Vesuvius," composed by Frank Ticheli, and Gustav Hoist's
"First Suite in E Flat," among others.
Lucas Sanders 'OB reacted to the performance
with an emphatic "Excellent!"
"There were a number of really fine solos," he

said.

If the Jazz and Wind Ensembles are any indication of what's to come later this year, be sure
to stay tuned: Lang Concert Hall has a busy
schedule ahead this next month. Alston, director
of the college Chorus, the Chamber Choir and
the Orchestra as well as the Chester Children's
Chorus, knows this well. Next up on his schedule
is the Chorus and Chamber Choir Concert this
Saturday, Nov. 20. The groups will be presenting
Mozart's "Requiem" and "Missa pro Defunctis,"
by Orlando di Lasso.
Then, on Dec. 4, the orchestra will be playing
Beethoven's "Symphony No. 9." The concert will
be "glorious," the overworked director said.
After the concert Alston plans to "sleep for a
while," he said.
Also forthcoming are two recitals by student
groups within the Fetter Chamber Music
Program, directed by Michael Johns, on Nov. 29
and Dec. 5. The program encompasses string
quartets, vocal groups and drumming ensembles
that receive expert coaching.

When girls went Greek too Basement jazz
BY JULIE BAKER

Jbakerl@swarthmore. edu
Many a Swattie has often wondered why there are no
sororities to accompany Delta Upsilon and Phi Psi. While
upperclassmen saw this as an opportunity to invent stories of girls' leaping off Clothier bell tower during initiations into Swat's long-dead division of Kappa Alpha Theta,
the abolition of sororities was, in the spirit of Swarthmore,

a political move.

Dean Bob Gross '69 explained that sororities were thriving entities at Swarthmore in the early twentieth century
"There was sort of a desire by one of the presidents to sort of
bring Swarthmore into the mainstream of American colle-

fraternities and sororities were introduced
here. I think [President] Ayedelott's movement in the 1920's
to introduce the Honors Program started to move us away
from that mainstream conception," he said.
Molly Yard Garret '33 was the first to challenge the Greek
system at Swarthmore. In an essay from The Meaning of
Swarthmore entitled "Getting Out the Vote," Garret
explained that her main opposition to the sororities was a
result of the social pressure and discrimination involved in
the "rushing," or encouraging underclassmen to pledge. A
member of Kappa Alpha Theta, Garret objected to her sorority's apparent refusal to accept Jewish women.
"Some of us decided we should eliminate the source of
such unfairness, and we organized the abolition campaign,
making sure that we had representation from each sorority,
as well as from women students who were left out of the system," Garret wrote.
To replace sororities as the dominant social organizers
for female students, Garret and her peers drafted a proposal
for the Women's Student Government Association. "We
learned that we didn't need the sorority system to have a
social life at college and a good time," she wrote.
According to Garret, the entire student body voted twice
on the referendum to abolish sororities at Swarthmore. It
passed by a significant margin both times.
Most alumnae seemed content to be without the presence
of sororities on campus.
"I can never remember a time when my social life was
lacking at Swarthmore. I didn't even know we ever had
sororities at Swarthmore, and it's just as well," said Barbara

Quaker tradition to avoid inequities. Sororities would have
compromised that," she said.
Gross explained that the lack of a movement to reinstate
the sororities was likely the result of an overall increase in
interactions between the genders. "I think that there was a
period in Swarthmore's history when relationships between
the genders were much more disparate. For instance, there
were separate dormitories for the sexes up until '69. There
was the Women's Student Government Association; there
was a men's judiciary committee and a women's judiciary
committee. There was the literary society for women. There
were a lot of organizations built around women, but most of
those organizations have disappeared," he said.

"There was sort of a desire by one

Swarthmore into the mainstream of
American collegiate life when

introduced here."
Bob Gross '62
dean of the college
Gross was unsure whether sororities will ever again
occupy a niche on Swarthmore's Campus. "I think that one
of the unique qualities of Swarthmore is that the social life
is very student-centered. If a group of women came to us and
said they wanted to start a sorority, they'd get a charter and
organize themselves. One thing we probably wouldn't do is
provide them with the kind of dedicated space that DU and
Phi Psi seem to be grandfathered in. But my sense of
Swarthmore's women is that there's not been a grand swell
for sororities," he explained.
"I think there's a certain ambivalence between the particular nature of Swarthmore and what I think of as Greek
Life. We are not a typical American college; both because of
our Quaker heritage and the particular academic niche that
we occupy. Students aren't drawn here by the appeal that
Greek Life offers," Gross added.

Porcelain, Love Letters
BY JOE KILLE
jkillel@swarthmore.edu
Made up of the three former At
The Drive-in members, Jim Ward,
Paul Hinojos, and Tony Hajjar, as
well as bassist Matt Miller, Sparta
works hard on their new album,
"Porcelain", to inch themselves closer and closer to the mainstream
while still producing bombastic,
sweeping, over-the-top tracks of progpunk miasma.

The real issue with this album is
whether or not Sparta, and by extension most of what used to be At The
Drive-In, has sold out. Are they still
authentic or have they entered that
world of marketable, commercial
"punk" (a musical label that brings
as much trouble-as calling something
"the blues")?
"Porcelain" is a really well puttogether album. Perhaps it's not as
epic as the members of Sparta would
have it, but there's a whole damn lot
of emotion, skilled playing and writing on display. Tracks like "While
Oceana Sleeps" and "Guns of
Memorial Park" are highly detailed
and complex without ever becoming
muddy. It's a powerful album, not for
its subtleties, but for the sheer force
that it maintains to keep all the

THE PHOENIX

aspects of each song together while

not diminishing them.

Sparta came to the TLA on Nov.
16. This was their first headlining
tour, and it seemed like they were
more than ready for it, as I had heard
only good things about it.
I recently saw Langhorne Slim
perform on a split bill with lan
Thomas at WXPN's World Cafe. It
was one of those singer/songwriterssitting-on-stools concerts, and I found
myself a bit under-whelmed by Mr.
Slim's performance. His set, which
included many of the songs present-

ed on the Electric Love Letter EP,
were performed solo with acoustic
guitar and paled in comparison to
Thomas's fine-tuned songwriting and
playing. I was willing to give him the
benefit of the doubt, though, and
check out the new EP, because who
knew, maybe it was the room, maybe
it was the crowd, or maybe
Langhorne Slim shouldn't have been

performing by himself.
It turned out to be the latter. The
little touches, like the addition of an
electric guitar to "My Future" and a
drum set to "The Electric Love
Letter," fill the gap between Slim's
guitar picking and distinctive vocal
styling. The most amazing transfor-

mation came with the track "One

Sunday Morning." It begins with an

intense, demented church choir belting out the song's refrain, "One

Sunday morning, you're acting crazy
again," and is followed by
Langhorne's voice and guitar backed
by what sounds like a slow, wavering
...

Leslietron line.
If I'd heard this album before I'd
seen him perform live, I would have
had a greater appreciation for
Langhorne Slim's songwriting and
performance sense. It's a solid output
from an artist who has a better handle on his bizarre songwriting than
previously thought Since he plays
only in New York, with occasional
jaunts to Philly and the South, check
out the ep before you go out of your
way to see him, and you'll be better
prepared to appreciate him than I
was a couple of weeks ago.
P.S. Gogol Bordello (gypsy punk
freak out rock from the Ukraine and
New York) and Kandy Whales (dirty
boogie electronicafrom right here in
Philly) will get the crowd moving at
the TLA on Nov. 20 at 9 p.m. Despite
what pessimistic thoughts you may

be having, you will not be disappointed by this show. Do yourself a
favor and go see some live music that
will probably damage both your
eardrums and your funk muscle.

Rules

of

Engagement, Vol. 2

Free Jazz is like your messy dorm room. To your
guests, it seems like a chaotic collection of crumpled
papers and dirty clothes. Your guests suggest that you
move the papers from your bed to your desk and that you
take the wadded up bed-sheets from your desktop and
put them on the mattress. It seems, quite clearly, that
this move back to normality would make living in your
room more comfortable. Your guests might be right.
But when the dorm room belongs to two explosive
leaders in new improvised music, bassist Dominic Duval
and saxophonist Joe McPhee, you might pause before
making suggestions. Within the first moments of the
record's first track, "Nexus," both Duval and McPhee
have displayed enough technical prowess to prove that
they could easily swing through the old changes and
maybe even add their own voice to a standard or two.
They could tidy up the place to impress their guests, but
there is no need to make changes; there is an order to
their madness.

McPhee's saxophone sounds like
an angered church choir battling
the tormented bass lines of a
Shostakovich symphony.
"Rules of Engagement, Vol. 2" shows the chaotic
workings of two improvisors at an almost painfully
stripped level. They're shacking up in Willets basement.
There is no drummer to provide time and no pianist to
feed chords. All of the playing, with the exception of the
beautifully reworked spiritual "Amazing Grace," is the
stirring of two improvisors caught in the act.
Joe McPhee's playing on this date is free from compositional constraints, but it is also free from many conventions of new improvised music. McPhee plays lightly
and lyrically, letting his saxophone float over Duval's
driving bass. McPhee leaves the honks and thumps that
characterize much of free jazz behind without resorting
to licks or cliches.
Duval's playing on "Nexus" is dark and, at times,
nearly deafening. His entrance sounds like the cue for a
symphonic bass section, not the bowing of a single
improvisor. But Duval does not depend on technique
alone. As the track winds to its conclusion, Duval drops
his bow and cuts his playing down from sheets of sound
to hints and plucks. As the track winds down to a dark
finish, Duval's playing evokes memories of Reggie
Workman's ballad playing behind John Coltrane.
The record continues with "Sunday Improvisations."
McPhee starts with a melodic statement that nearly
approximates a head for a conventional tune. Duval
enters, sending a wave of energy into the track through
his quickly moving bass lines. McPhee is set up, able to
roam freely through sounds ranging from showy cut
licks to introspective, sensitive playing.
On "Sunday's Coda," the duo turns its attention to a

modern-classical sound. Joe McPhee's shrill bursts of

noise show his ability to express his music through
sound explorations in addition to note explorations.
"Birmingham Sunday" returns the record's focus to
music more deeply rooted in jazz traditions. The conflicting styles of McPhee's sax and Duval's bass are raging throughout the track. McPhee's saxophone sounds
like an angered church choir battling what could be the
tormented bass lines of a Shostakovich symphony.
The duo's sound is stripped to its core on "Amazing
Grace," the spiritual often used by Duval to close his concerts. While McPhee gives a light and breathy approximation of the melody, Duval quietly explores the chord
changes as played by a non-existent pianist. Left alone to
accompany the soloist, Duval puts his bass in a more
prominent role than is provided in the traditional pianotrio. The result is beautiful.
This record captures two brilliant improvisors in top
form. It is one of the finest new records I have had the
fortune to stumble across and I would recommend it to
anyone, even if they aren't very familiar with the genre.
Tune in to WSRN tonight at 5:30 to see if you agree.

The myth of the 'mature' female orgasm

SARAH WALSH
Sex and the Swattie

I will never forget the line from "The
of Wrath" that refers to the generation of fathers shipping their families
West as men who knew far more about the
workings of a carburetor than about the
mysteries of the clitoris (forgive my paraphrasing, John).
Even now, after many studies have
shown that the clitoris is the primary sexual organ for women (and for some people
who do not self-identify as women) and
the ONLY major source of sexual pleasure
for many, both popular magazines and
scientific literature continue to laud the
vaginal orgasm. Maps and instructions
abound that guarantee to teach women to
have "Mind-Blowing G-spot Orgasms."
Really, it's an ingenious marketing
scheme. I myself fell for it a few years ago,
after I began to have "real" heterosexual
sex, i.e. vaginal penetration, and found
Grapes

that it fell far, far short of my expectations.
For years, I had longingly believed the
all-too-familiar Hollywood sex scene:
Thrust, thrust, "YES, YES!" According to
the sex books I began to devour, I was supposed to be "an orgasmer," and I was aokay with getting down with myself. The
trick, they all assured me, was figuring
out where my all-powerful G-spot was.
Happily, there was no shortage of sexperts, doctors and therapists peddling
their wares on Amazon.com who promised that, contrary to my experience,

becoming vaginally aroused was quite
simple. Initially, $2O seemed well worth
their promises, but after poking, rubbing
and fondling every part of my inside only

to experience nothing other than the
desire to pee, the exchange seemed a bit
pricey. Still, each book I purchased (and
believe me, there were plenty) convinced
me that the problem was located somehow in my abnormality of a body, my
inability to be "in touch" with its wonders, or just plain clumsiness.
My boyfriend at the time, though very
understanding, was perplexed, as his last
girlfriend had had no such "problem." In
between our continually disappointing
interludes, I assured him that I would fix
things very soon. Despite my assurances,
I was actually feeling pretty hopeless and
began to suspect that God had wired my
box wrong.
Then I stumbled on a terribly written
book called "How to Achieve Orgasm in
Five Minutes Every Time." I ordered it
late one night thinking, "What the hell?"
And though I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, it completely revolutionized my

view

of penetrative sex. The author

explained that contrary to our society's
obsession with vaginal orgasm and the Gspot, in terms of pure pleasure wattage,
the clit reigns supreme. To my shock,
nowhere in the book did she describe
exercises to help readers "learn" to
orgasm vaginally. The beauty of her outlook instead lay in its simplicity.
Masturbate during intercourse, she told
at every opportunity, in every posius
tion.

Women need long lovemaking sessions because
their systems take longer
to "warm up" than men?
Bollocks, she said.
At first I was annoyed that I had spent
I mean,
money for this obvious advice
I had been having sex alone for quite
some time. But then I began to listen to

her. She even advised women who "could"
vaginally orgasm (although almost all
women who can require hefty amounts of
clitoral stimulation) to masturbate during sex, as it's basically a two-for-one
deal.
All the literature that describes how
women need long lovemaking sessions
because their systems take longer to
"warm up" than men? Bollocks, she said.

It's just that for men, penetrative sex
replicates masturbation, and for most
women it doesn't come close. Her last

piece of advice honestly changed my life.
"Won't changing your definition of 'sex'
create a lot less friction than a disappointing sex life?" she said.
I know that I have written about this
topic before, but since reading this book I
have discovered that lack of orgasm during intercourse is a huge problem for
many women having sex with men. Even
the few I know who can have 'vaginal'
orgasms have told me that often they
don't.
There has been a historical perception
that the female orgasm is an afterthought
to the male one
that it's a nice bonus,
but not necessary for "successful" heterosexual sex. Instead, women are supposed
to be content with feeling "nice." I disagree.
Of course, there are always a few times
when things just aren't working out, but
there is no reason why women shouldn't
be orgasming during intercourse every
time, at least once (one of the beautiful
aspects of the clitoris). Sure, some guys
are uncomfortable with the idea at first,
and sometimes this stems from a feeling
of inadequacy or a desire to please, but in
my opinion any decent guy will alter his
assumptions about what sex should and
shouldn't be when he sees how happy you
are. And if your hand doesn't do the job,
or you're just really lazy, invest in a good
vibrator.
So yes, although I am a bit of a
Jehovah's witness about this topic, I figured it would be apropos, since this column will end up being my last. And I do
like a good arc.

‘Bridget Jones’: The End of Patience
BY ABBY

GRABER

agraberl@swarthmore.edu

"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason" answers an interesting question best ignored by romantic comedies: What
happens after Hollywood abandons the story and the relationship is left to survive in a universe without the legal

requirement of a happy ending?
In other words, following a series of gross misjudgments,
ineffective diets, drunken self-pity sessions, declarations of
feminine independence, humiliation in front of snooty academics, inappropriate fashion choices, exposure on national
television, and creative undergarments, what happens after
Bridget and her beau end up kissing the snow? Apparently,
a series of gross misjudgments, ineffective diets, drunken
self-pity sessions, declarations of feminine independence,
humiliation in front of snooty academics, inappropriate
fashion choices, exposure on national television, and creative undergarments, culminating with Bridget and her
beau kissing the snow. There's a pattern here, I just know it.
After 10 minutes of "The Edge of Reason," the sequel to
"Bridget Jones's Diary," you will begin to entertain the possibility that the producers weren't interested in making a
fresh new movie, but rather, they were concerned with making you pay theater prices for the first film all over again.
"The Edge of Reason" follows unabashedly (although it
should be very abashed) in the footsteps of the "Austin
Powers" franchise, re-releasing the same script, characters
and jokes under a different title and having the audacity to
call it a new film. Shame.
When we last left Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger)
she was happily shacked up with Mark
aged 33, spinster
Darcy (Colin Firth), the "surprise" love interest of the last
film who differs noticeably from the standard by not being
Hugh Grant. Never fear, romance-devotees, Grant is back in
"The Edge of Reason," reprising his role as Daniel Cleaver,
Bridget's womanizing ex-boyfriend and ex-boss who is now
paying the rent by making inappropriate broadcasts as the
anchor for a televised travel program ("New York: the city

10

that never sleeps with the same person twice").
"The Edge of Reason" takes a small eternity to develop
any kind of cohesive narrative. Writers Helen Fielding,
Richard Curtis, Andrew Davies and Adam Brooks are
obsessed with just how hilarious they were the last time
around and can't resist condensing many of the funny
scenes from "Bridget Jones's Diary" into an unnecessary
half-hour recap. Only this time, in a desperate attempt to up
the ante, they've forced poor Bridget into the most ridiculous, contrived situations possible, only to deliver a
rehashed punch line. Instead of having Bridget sliding down
a fireman's pole and landing butt-first on the camera in one
of the eternally hokey sequences from her news show, "Sit
Up, Britain," she must skydive into a pigsty and then land
butt-first on the camera. Similar treatment is given to the
requisite "Bridget embarrasses herself at a formal function"
bit, "Bridget embarrasses herself at a family function" bit,

and "Bridget embarrasses herself in front ofCleaver" bit.
It's a pity that the humor is forced upon the movierather

than allowed to grow organically from Bridget's character.
Zellweger has continued to make Bridget one of the most likable women to hit the screen with her muddled behavior,
erratic thought process, and portly body, she's far easier to
identify and laugh with (okay, at) than the impossibly perfect Julia Roberts or Andie MacDowell. Her very nature is
whimsically hilarious, so stunts like skydiving only detract
from the focus on Bridget herself.
Hopelessly trying to escape the specter of the first film,
Bridget breaks up with Darcy for spurious reasons
"You
could never muster the strength to fight for me," she sighs,
although, ifI recall, he landed some pretty hefty punches on
and heads with Cleaver to
Hugh Grant on her behalf
Thailand. And while this leads to some brief amusement, it's
essentiaUy an abridged version of her relationship with
Cleaver from the original, this time with Thai food.
Though more bizarre and exotic, "The Edge of Reason" is
a far cry from its fun and spontaneous prequel. It's proof
positive that sometimes by taking a familiar story to new
heights, you're simply plunging it into old depths.

New Orleans: City of alcohol, po' boys, alligator sausage, more alcohol, bad cover bands, near-topless waitresses, and yet more alcohol. Jon's verdict: "It's awesome. Blee'aaargh."

N'awlins, one Huge-Ass Beer at a time
We drove into
New Orleans early
in the morning, and
a few minutes later,
we drove right out
as it happens, the
Quality Inn was in a
"suburb" of the city.

When we walked
into the hotel, the

first thing the lady
at the registration
desk told us was to
take
everything
valuable out of our
car. Right then, we
knew we were in for
a treat.
From our hotel

window, we had a

sweet view of the
freeway. After moving everything Emiliano owned into the hotel, we went
we mean, uh, beds. Two of
to sleep in the double bed
them. Separate. So yeah, we slept from 10 a.m. until 6
p.m., which was when we decided we were going to start
drinking.
Like the good Boy Scouts we are, we knew we wouldn't be driving out of New Orleans after drinking that
evening, so we caught the bus. This is where we got our
first taste of southern hospitality. When we got on the
bus, we told the bus driver we were from out of town and
asked her if she could tell us when to get off to go to the
...

French Quarter, a.k.a. Drunkland. She didn't tell us
when to get off the bus, but when we noticed we had
arrived back at the hotel half an hour later, she did tell
us how stupid we were for missing our stop.
Eventually we made it to the French Quarter and did
what we do best: We looked for food. We settled on a
semi-nice restaurant called Oceania and quickly learned
how New Orleans makes all its money: Stupid drunk college kids come to town and sit there while hot waitresses hit on them, encouraging them to buy drinks. We
know that's how they do it everywhere else, but in New
Orleans it actually works, even on Jews like Jon.
We had our first taste of the local drink, The
Hurricane. It did about as much damage to our livers as
THE PHOENIX

the real hurricane did to Florida's trailer parks last
October. While we were eating alligator sausage and
world-famous po' boys (think Sharpies fried fish bar in a
hoagie), our hot waitress kept touching Emiliano's
shoulder and encouraging him to try a hand grenade. He
told her he had a hand grenade for her
in his pants.
Okay, that didn't happen. We passed on the hand
grenades, because after standing up we realized we were
pretty drunk. Apparently a Hurricane has six shots of
rum in it, even though it tastes like the nectar of the gods.
After dinner, we decided to head for the bars. At this
point, Emiliano wasn't quite of age, so we headed for the
dingiest bar we could find. We thought on the one hand,
we'd get served, but on the other hand, it would be by
large men.
...

We had our first taste of the local
drink, The Hurricane. It did about as
much damage to our livers as the
real hurricane did to Florida's trailer
parks last October.
When we walked into Krazy Korner, we noticed two
and we mean everyone young,
things. First, everyone
was tanked. Second,
old, really old, hot, not, fit or fat

all of the drinks were really expensive, so we made a pact
to forget how much money we spent that night. This
turned out to be pretty easy. As it is, we have a little bit
of trouble remembering how we got back to the hotel.
The first thing we ordered was a drink called the
Huge-Ass Beer. Jeff Schneider 'O5 gets the prize for
astutely guessing, upon hearing this, that these were
some big beers. Think three red cups. The bar also
offered hard alcohol administered by a nearly topless
waitress shooting alcohol into your mouth with a threefoot syringe while riding you. Every nerd in the joint
was paying top dollar for the treatment. Too bad no
amount of money would change the fact that they were
losers. We ordered another Huge-Ass Beer.
After a while, we decided we were too cool for Krazy
Korner. Besides, Emiliano was ready to fight a bouncer,
so we headed for one of the nicer bars. Jon got in with-

November 18, 2004

out any trouble. While Jon flirted with Hans, the big,
bald, muscular 'roidhead of a bouncer, Emiliano snuck
in through a window behind him.
To celebrate this genius coup d'etat, we took three
shots of Jager, which came in test tubes, so we felt like
scientists. At this point, we deduced, using the scientific
method, that every bar in New Orleans bills itself as the
home of the blues. Somehow this justifies shitty cover
bands playing "Mustang Sally" and "You Shook Me All
Night Long" all night long. Instead of leaving, we decided to take more shots and heckle the band. Hans escorted us out soon thereafter, but as we were being dragged
out, we managed to get two more test tubes down.
We grabbed some pizza to soak up the booze and
decided to start heading back to the hotel. Before catching a taxi, we ran into this other dude selling pizza on
the street, so we decided to eat some more because we
are fat. Then Jon, who thinks he is a Chessmaster 3000,
found a local chess hustler. Emiliano knows he sucks but
played him anyway.
Long story short, we lost 40 bucks, as the hustler beat
us simultaneously. We caught a taxi and took our pizza
back to the hotel. By that time, the total for the night was
roughly $2OOO
each. While driving back to the hotel,
the taxi driver asked Jon what he though about
N'awlins. Jon said, "Everything I had ever heard about
they're
it is true: the beads, the breasts and the booze
all there. And it's awesome. Bleeaaargh." Sweet.
The next morning, we thought we'd make one more
trip back to the French Quarter before heading to Texas.
The French Quarter was a bit more subdued and smelled
a lot like vomit. We ate some delicious po' boys at a local
favorite, Johnny's Po' Boys. It is a must if you are ever
in New Orleans. There is nothing like fried animal
hoagie with mayonnaise to get your day started.
The music was also different by day. Instead of suffering through "Mustang Sally" again, we got to hear
some good old Zydeco music on the street, and there was
something appealing about that Cajun talk. Sure, we
couldn't understand a word the grandpa in overalls was
singing about, but we felt at ease listening to that crazy
old gypsy who had lost her shoes the night before
scratching away on that washboard while smoking her
last cigarette. We headed for the car and said goodbye to
New Orleans. It was time to hit the road again.

WSRN FUBAR
The WSRN board has been laboring under serious
difficulties recently. After all, the Parrish renovations
would be a major disruption to the station's operation no

matter what they did. And as DJs have been facing an
unpleasant struggle to keep their shows going in the face
of dust, debris and noise in the studio, weak and inter-

mittent over-the-air transmission and an unreliable webcast, and frequent malfunctions of the studio CD players,
the managers have been inundated with complaints that
they simply don't have the resources to handle.
First, setup this year has been uncharacteristically
rushed due to the longdelays in the move process. When

broadcasting began this semester much of the studio's

collection of LPs and CDs remained scattered and disorganized and the station had no telephone or computer
and therefore no way to call for help if problems developed. And even with such a rushed start, this broadcast
season will only last about half the semester, a week and
a half of which took place before the official release of
the broadcasting schedule.
Part of the blame for this comes from the board's
determination to broadcast this semester despite the

numerous delays. But many of those delays can themselvs be blamed on Facilities' slow response to the
WSRN board's concerns, itself a product of the low priority the administration seems to place on WSRN

affairs.
Second, there simply haven't been enough available
managers to deal with problems as they crop up.
Transmission outages, both over the air and on webcast,
have occurred repeatedly without warning from the
managers, and there hasn't been a good channel for DJs
telling managers about transmission problems and managers passing on that information to other DJs.
Similarly, DJs with slots during the day have experienced problems with debris left around the studio and
disruption by construction work during their shows, as
well as unreliable access to the studio itself, as the door
up to the station has been unexpectedly locked, or the
outside access pathway to Parrish North blocked or
closed off. Not only do some students get unfairly
deprived of time on their shows, but at other times some
students get unfairly forced to spend their time filling up
dead air because students have been kept out of the station or, again, have stopped going to their time slot out
of frustration.
In both cases, these problems could at least be ameliorated if there were a way the WSRN managers could
keep all DJs informed of the transmission status of the
station based on reports from past DJs and constantlybe
monitoring the accessibility of the station and able to
handle last-minute rescheduling. Unfortunately, a small
group of student managers simply can't provide the constant oversight necessary to perform those tasks.
This brings us to our third and final point, which is
that though these problems have been greatly exacerbated by the current situation, the general problem with
WSRN has not changed. It is extremely difficult to run a
20-hour-a-day radio station on a managerial staff of students with their own busy schedules who can only
address problems during their free time.
To deal with the current difficulties and prevent
recurrences in the future, WSRN needs to be able to
count on the full cooperation of Facilities when dealing
with issues like the Parrish move, a guarantee the
administration hasn't been able to provide. It also needs
an expanded budget to get an adequate staff: We need
both a part-time engineer, preferably an outside contractor who can be reliably on call to fix technical problems
as they occur. For a student with academic commitments to meet, being the WSRN engineer is currently a
thankless and impossible task. And we need to be able to
set up a large set of paid staffers, at least one of whom
can be on call for most of the day to immediately handle
scheduling problems as they occur, rather than hoping
one of the managers will be available whenever something goes wrong. If the administration believes a wellrun radio station is important for students' self-expression and sense of community, as they claim to, then they
need to seriously consider giving WSRN the funding to
make these changes.

New hope to stop Sudan conflict
Dear Editor:
The Genocide Intervention Fund (see "Students lead

efforts to fight genocide in Sudan," Oct. 28, pg. 5), which aims
to privately finance underfunded African Union troops in
Darfur, is well on its way to becoming a reality. Mark Hanis
'O5 and I would like to give the campus a brief update on the
exciting progress we have made in the last week.
Last Thursday, the Center for American Progress (CAP),
a progressive Washington-based think tank founded in 2001,
officially sponsored the Genocide Intervention Fund. Our
main contact is a woman named Gayle Smith, a former special advisor to Bill Clinton and Senior Director for African
Affairs in the National Security Council from 1998-2001
CAP's lawyers will tackle the legal work necessary to grant
the Genocide Intervention Fund 501-C3 tax-exempt status.
Moreover, the CAP has volunteered to manage pledged
funds until we officially are granted 501-C3 status. To top it

off, the CAP has promised massive media coverage of this
campaign.
Most importantly, we have received word from the
African Union (AU). Patrick Mazimhaka, Deputy
Chairperson of the African Union, was moved, impressed
and excited when Ms. Smith contacted him about the creation of the Genocide Intervention Fund. With any luck, in
the coming days, AU lawyers will iron out the details to
make this initiative possible.
This Saturday at 2 p.m. in Kohlberg 116, Mark and I will
host an information session about the efforts Swarthmore
students are making to fight the genocide occurring in
Darfur, highlighting our two most promising campaigns: the
Genocide Intervention Fund and the divestment campaign,
led by Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5. We are going to need all the
help we can get.

The cost of our sunshine

Our kudos to Katharine Merow. She
has aptly prescribed the panacea of pessimism to treat the despondency currently ailing those of us who have in vain been
trying to improve the world ("Eternal
sunshine of the apathetic mind," Nov. 11,
pg. 18). At one time, we would have found
her sentiments disappointing and regrettable, but we now realize that disappointment and regret are the futile affects of
the naive. As Merow points out, the result

The lethargy of international response

Indeed, what a waste of effort and ink

civil liberties and voting rights upon the
"pigheaded and herdish" citizens of the

occurrence, based on the assumption of
their inevitability? It is infinitely less taxing on the emotions to assume human
beings capable of any degree of violence
and evil in the first place, so as to save

ourselves the inconvenience of experiencing the shock and outrage that propel us
to action. Our newfound indifference and
cynicism have quieted the consciences
that once nagged us on this issue. We only
hope that the millions of victims can find
similar solace in this view.
Submission to our fate is the most log-

Moderates fooled again

I know it's in Texas, it's probably in

that says, fool me once,
shame on shame on you. It
fool me
We can't get fooled again.

Apparently Maria Macia 'O7 doesn't
know the saying either. In her op-ed in
The Phoenix after the election ("Not quite
the end of the world," Nov. 4, pg. 20), she
exposed her deep misunderstanding of
the meaning of this electoral outcome.
Her hope that Bush can now moderate his
presidency because he is no longer
beholden to his base is not reasonable.
Bush improved from losing the popular
vote and having his presidency contested
through the legal system in 2000 to winning convincingly in the face of recordhigh voter turnout in 2004. Pointing to

this, Bush has declared that he has a mandate from the nation to aggressively pursue his policies.
Bush is unlikely to face much opposi-

tion on his domestic agenda, considering
the huge swing of power in the Senate
and the continued consolidation of
Republican
in the House.

Where is this "rise" evident? All the evidence that I have- seen suggests quite an
opposite trend, where moderate voices

I too do not think that this outcome is

ultimate

decision-making authority on matters ranging
from academic affairs to

the investment of our

billion-dollar

endow-

ment, from student life
to the selection and appointment of the president. A central, though not exclusive, criterion for the selection of
members of the board is the ability to provide financial
support or avenues to financial support for the college.
Empowered with the knowledge that wealth was a determining factor in the selection of those with the authority
to determine the direction of our college, I set out to
uncover the scandal behind the Swarthmore College governance system.
I first conducted research into the backgrounds of the
members of the Board of Managers. I prayed they were all
executives at evil multinational corporations like Exxon-

Mobil, Wal-Mart and Monsanto. The first board member I
researched was John D. Goldman. I soon discovered that
his mother was the great-grandniece of Levi Strauss. Ahha! Extreme wealth! But it turns out that his parents'
foundation, the Richard and Rhonda Goldman Fund, is a
leading contributor to the Sierra Club, the Rainforest
Action Network, the Natural Resources Defense Council,
the National Audubon Society, and the list goes on and
on. Drat noble moneyed environmentalists!
Convinced that the evil, corporate nature of our Board
of Managers would yet expose itself, I perused the board's
bylaws. Article IV of the board manual reads: "the Board
operates on the Quaker procedure of reaching decisions
by 'sense of the meeting' rather than motions or votes.
The procedure involves full, open and friendly discussion
of issues before the Board or its committees with the aim
of framing a 'minute' for the record which can be adopted
by consensus (that is, without expressed opposition)."

letters

to

Damn it. I couldn't exactly vilify the righteous tradition
of consensus.
Not ready to throw in the towel, I made an appoint-

ment with Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6l to discuss
the college governance structure. Maurice gave me two
important leads. He told me that the college regularly supports legislation as a member of lobbying organizations
and occasionally supports or opposes legislation independently. Oh boy! Certainly Swarthmore must have supported corrupt legislation at some point, I thought. It
turns out that during the McCarthy era, there was plenty
of corrupt legislation around

for instance, Congress

required students applying for loans to sign a loyalty oath
to the United States and an affidavit regarding membership in the Communist Party
but Swarthmore wouldn't have any ofit. Swarthmore emerged as a leader among
colleges and universities in protecting its students'
rights, declining aid under the McCarthy-era legislation.
Perhaps my second lead from Maurice Eldridge would
pan out. He told me that as a result of the recent scandals
in corporate America, a change in the board's bylaws is
under consideration. Hmm. Was Swarthmore afraid of
becoming the next Enron? I found out that in the wake of
Enron, WorldCom and other corporate governance debacles, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, intended to
reform public accounting practices and other corporate
governance processes. Since its passage, Swarthmore has
studied the act's suggestions of the "best practices" for an
audit process, many of which can be used in the nonprofit world. Although we were not legally required to
comply with the act, as it only applies to publicly traded
companies, Swarthmore's Audit Subcommittee was
already doing most of the things that the act recommended. Going above and beyond the call of duty, the Audit
Subcommittee refined its statement of roles and responsibilities to include as many of the "best practices" as
seemed appropriate. It is this revision of the board's
bylaws that is now under consideration.
My best hopes for unearthing a corporate scandal to
soothe my post-election angst were dashed. But my pride
in being a Swattie skyrocketed. If I ever were to accumulate enough wealth to be selected to serve on the Board of

liberal arts

My high school geometry
class was as good as geometr
gets. We learned geometr
from
an all-time grea
arguably the best geomete
who ever lived. For we did no
learn from Mr. Smith (th
name has been changed to pro
tect the innocent). We learnet
from Euclid.
Euclid was our teacher, hi
"Elements," our textbook. Mr
Smith was not our teacher s
much as he was our facilitator
TARU TAYLOR
or tutor. He spent the school
year helping us sophomores
Gadfly
master what is perhaps the
masterpiece of mathematical
l^mmmm
deduction. He let the epitome
of classical geometry speak for itself. Why should the student

learn from the latest written-by-committee textbook when he
can learn from the singular Greek genius who synthesized and
recorded the original Egyptian science of earth measurement?
That class was so great because it was not about Mr. Smith, a
good man to be sure. It was about Euclid, a great man who has
stood for 2,300 years as the standard-bearer of geometry.
Thus, I learned geometry as a liberal art. But what does that
mean? What is a liberal art? What is a liberal arts education?
From all the platitudes and university president speeches
which have talked around that question, one would think that
the question had no specific answer. It does.
Grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, music and
astronomy are the seven liberal arts. The first three make up
the trivium or "three roads" to knowledge, and the final four
make up the quadrivium, or "four roads" to knowledge. Like
the S.A.T., which is divided into the verbal and mathematical
sections, the liberal arts are divided into the verbal trivium anc
the mathematical quadrivium. Indeed, "trivial" has negativ
connotations because the trivium was considered to be the ele
mentary group during the Middle Ages, the era which define
the liberal arts. The verbal sciences were preparation for th
mathematical sciences. All of the liberal arts were preparatio
for philosophy.

Roughly speaking, the liberal arts were taught in seven sue
cessive stages of increasing difficulty, from grammar to rheto
ric to logic, then on to the quadrivium, from arithmetic to geom
etry to music, then, finally, to astronomy. Grammar is primary
All of the liberal arts indeed, all other disciplines not includ
ed among the liberal arts
are based on grammar. That this i
true of mathematics and the mathematical sciences can b
demonstrated by the simple fact that every mathematical anc
scientific statement can be stated grammatically, e.g. "2 2 4
can be stated as "Two plus two equals four." The point to b
made here is that all of the liberal arts are interconnected var
ations of the same comprehensive truth. Anyway, the medieva
conception of the liberal arts as successive stages is much lik

No love for women? Thanks, soccer fans
Dear Editor:
I remember, a few weeks before November began,
chatting with some Barn friends about their plans for
but, the hormustache greatness. The wax, the dye
mones? We have all seen Jon Fombonne 'O5 and
Emiliano Rodriguez 'os's column ("Hate the man, love
the 'stache," Nov. 11, pg. 14), the e-mailed invitation to
celebrate Mustache November and the various styles
and degrees of mustache around campus. But has no
one acknowledged an overwhelming feeling of being left
out? Where, I ask, are the women of Swarthmore, fighting for their right to celebrate this final glorious month
before the bitter chill of winter finally sets in? While the
men can display this joy prominently on their faces,
what are we women to do? Neglecting to shave altogether doesn't seem to have nearly the same effect.
Needless to say, I am shocked at this display of collective, celebrated sexism. Living through the mustaches of others just isn't satisfying enough, and I am
left with a feeling of loss and defeat. If "a man without a
mustache is a man without a soul," as Confucius
claimed, what does that make a woman? "Stupid" as
this month may be, according to one claim in Jon and
Emiliano's column, I long for a solution by which all
Swatties could become involved. Although I
understand, after exploring mustachesummer.com, that
this is a month meant to combat prejudice against the
mustache, I feel that it has presented a different type of
prejudice instead. Unfortunately, I have no desire to partake of a micrograft transplant as the site suggests. At
least on the nights when I have too much work to go to
Pub Nite, I guess I will be sitting this one out.

THE PHOENIX

Dear Editor:
On behalf of the players and staff of the 2004
Garnet men's soccer team, we would like to publicly
express our deepest gratitude to the hundreds of you
who supported us throughout the 2004 soccer season.
The excitement, energy, enthusiasm, and attitude
that you brought to the matches filled us with pride
and created an electric atmosphere every time we
stepped on the field this year. Without all of you, over
2,600 strong at our home matches in Clothier Stadium
and close to 4,000 total this season, we would not have
been nearly as strong and as successful as we were.
Our undefeated record at home in the regular season
(7-0-2) and, indeed, until the ECAC Final on Sunday,
was due in part to the average attendance of the more
than 220 crazy fans we packed into the stands at
Clothier Stadium.
From our Garnet Alumni Tournament championship in early September to the first win over
Haverford in a decade in late October, and even to the
Centennial Conference semifinals at Johns Hopkins
when almost 200 of you came by car, bus and who
knows how else, we thank you for you support and we
cannot wait to see you again next autumn.
Please continue to support all the Garnet teams as
you have with us, and this atmosphere and excitement will become a regular part of life at
Swarthmore!

Intelligence comes down to the ability to solve problems. It
divine spark, circumspection, is about seeing and understanc

key to developing circumspection, because they teach peopl
how to think. In other words, they teach people how to genera

the free man, that is because the liberal arts liberate man from
the Platonic cave. These disciplines teach us to see specifics a
shadows of the general and to see particulars as shadows of th
universal. The liberally educated man is a generalist who see
that Asian civilization, European civilization and African civ
lization, et. al., are mere shadows ofhuman civilization.
If the generalist is the hero of the liberal arts education, then
what about the specialist who majors in a specific discipline? I
such a specialist claims to be liberally educated, is he not sus

tion, taken wholesale from Germany, produces an ivory towe
myopia which seems to be at cross purposes with the compre

eral arts and generalization. Only the generalist can tackle th
problems of the world and civilization, which are, of course
interdisciplinary. Only the problems of the ivory tower ar

arts" a sophisticated herd instinct. But as Emerson saic

Student Council Platforms

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

These are the platforms for candidates for Student Council as submitted to The Phoenix. The
following positions are up for election: co-president, appointments chair, campus life representative, campus relations representative and student events adviser. These platforms are submitted by the candidates and represent their views, not the views of The Phoenix.

SC will hold online voting from Thursday, Nov. 18 through Sunday, Nov. 21, and Sharpies voting will take place during lunch and dinner on Monday, Nov. 22 and Tuesday, Nov. 23. The
results will be announced on Wednesday.
CO-PRESIDENT
Tom Evnen 'O7
At Swarthmore, the Student Council co-presidents are
given an important and unique opportunity to improve
student life because they are in constant communication
with the college administration. During my term as the
Student Council appointments chair, I have worked to
ensure that the appointments process became more efficient and objective and helped make possible the campuswide viewing of the first presidential debate by spearheading the effort to get the SAC funding that it required.
Student Council co-presidents must be able to run meetings efficiently and productively. My semester on council
has given me the experience necessary to do this.
If elected co-president, I hope to be able to encourage
more students to participate in discussions about student
life by offering myself as a committed advocate of their
concerns and proposals. I believe that Swarthmore's student body could benefit immensely from a renewed
engagement with campus-wide initiatives, as evidenced by
the tremendous energy with which Swarthmore students
took up "get out the vote" efforts this November. In order
to facilitate this engagement, Student Council needs a copresident who cares about student proposals, will take
them to the administration, and get things done.

Matt Meltzer 06

Hey Swatties, Matt Meltzer here. Over the summer and
during the first week of school, I chaired the 2004

Orientation Committee. To say the least, chairing orientation was a tremendous amount of work, but the fun I had
working with a talented and dedicated group of CAs, meeting new students, hiring the entertainment, and working
with the Deans and administration more than made up for
the few gray hairs I ended up with once it was over. The
experience also gave me a valuable insight into how the
administration's clock ticks and the knowledge of how we
should work with the administration to get the results we
want. A few things that come to mind are: parking
arrangements such that those with cars off campus are no
longer repeatedly ticketed while on campus; more open
lines of communication to the Board of Managers so concerned student groups can have a voice; and more information about the resources on campus available to those
who want to bring speakers, host events, and run programs but aren't exactly up to speed on the way to get
there. If some of these concerns sound familiar to you, feel
free to drop me a line!

APPOINTMENTS CHAIR
Eric Cooperman 'O7
Every day, students appointed to Swarthmore committees make important decisions affecting everything from
who gets a parking spot to the amount of the student activities fee. With the wide influence these committees have,
we need an appointments process that is fair, efficient, and
more accessible so more people can get involved in student
government. As a two-term member of the Student Budget
Committee, I have twice seen the appointments process
from the applicant's side. I want to make the appointments
process more flexible and efficient to keep up with the pace
of life at Swarthmore. It should be more user-friendly as

well. I'll accomplish these goals by keeping applicants
informed of the status of their application at all stages of
the process, and I'll ensure that every qualified candidate
has an opportunity to speak with the Appointments
Committee about their ideas. If I am elected, I guarantee I
will put in the time and energy needed to swiftly fill vacancies, because positions should not go unfilled for months.
If you have any questions or suggestions, please email me
at ecooperL Thanks for your time, and I hope to have your
support in this election.

Alex Leader-Smith 'O6
It has a nice ring, doesn't it? Don't let that fool you,
though; I'm not in this for the title. I'm running because I
believe I have the time, energy and dedication to do justice
to the very difficult student appointment process. I will
strive to publicize and fully detail all committee openings.
I will work diligently to instate the best, most responsible
people in every available role. And I will seek to offer auxiliary positions to qualified candidates not chosen for committees. Capable, devoted individuals who want to make a
difference should always have jobs.
I will also be a dedicated, vocal member of Student
Council. I'm willing to listen and learn from others, but

I'm also prepared to speak my mind. More importantly,
though, I'm prepared to act. I want to leave Swarthmore a
brighter, happier, more enjoyable place than when I found
it. I want to put enthusiastic, dynamic people in places
where they can succeed. That's why I want to be on

Student Council.
That's why Alex Leader-Smith: Swarthmore College
appointments chair rings so nicely.

Ethan Ucker 'O7
As leader of the SVRC organizing for this last election,
I saw first-hand that when students felt that they had

something at stake, they snapped out of their notoriously
apathetic mindset and assumed the role of politically
engaged members in the community. If elected appointments chair, I hope to cultivate and maintain a more
proactive attitude among the student body towards the
operations of Swarthmore's student government. I will
ensure that all potential appointees are screened rigorously through the application and interview processes. I will
expect that all appointed members of student groups are
committed to an agenda that reflects the principles upheld
by the Student Council
a body by definition representa-

tive of all students.

My hope is that by holding appointees more accountable to their proposed agendas, more students will recognize that they are affected by the decisions made by
Student Council and the appointees. More students will
apply for appointments and get involved in voting, and
hopefully a more active, socially responsible attitude will
be woven into the fabric of this community. I hope that the
hard work, energy and commitment that students gave to
the November election can be a consistent feature of our
student government.

CAMPUS RELATIONS REP.

SECRETARY
Jonathan Ference 'O7
What are you looking for in a Student Council representative? Someone who knows the school and SC inside
and out and someone who is in touch with the student
body and not afraid to take an informed, visible stance on
political issues on and off campus.
The positions I've had, from Van Coordinator to playing
hockey at Motherpuckers, have granted me a deep understanding of how Swarthmore works. The same is true of
my appointment

to the Council on Educational Policy,

where I work with faculty, administration and two other
students to determine the college's academic future. I also
have SC experience: This past semester, I served as the
Daily Gazette observer, forming a strong rapport with
members and learning how the council works. My organizational skills and love for law and procedure will make
me an effective secretary and treasurer.
My initiatives will include: posting SC minutes on the
Internet expediently; increasing dialogue between SC and
students on important issues like the Living Wage and the
college's future direction; ending the SAC funding debacle;
and ensuring that morning shuttles and evening shuttles

are always running as scheduled.

Want experience and qualifications? Vote Fer for SC

secretary.

Sarah Hobbs 06
Although it will be impossible to ever fill the shoes of
our current, and may I say brilliant secretary, I, Sarah
Elizabeth Hobbs, wish to run for Secretary my only real

qualification being that I undoubtedly have the neatest
entire campus. The way I see it, is that
anyone who wanted to be secretary here could take good
notes and stay up to date on Student Council proceedings.
That platform certainly won't set me apart, and judging
from the presidential election, no one really cares what I
want to do in the upcoming year anyway. The following is
all I ask you to remember when casting your vote.
I have impeccable moral character, am from the South
(and by South I mean Colorado), and I have incredible
handwriting. This way, were there ever to be an electronic failure, power outage, or alien takeover, I could quickly
and neatly write out 1400 copies of the minutes and neatly
place them in every mailbox. I take lots of notes, so my
right hand is in great shape and in seventh grade I attended a three day conference on note-taking methods. Even
with ITS, in today's world of terror we can not rely on
technology. I am the solution.

Joella Fink 07

So you probably aren't sure right now who I am. I'm
in Vertigo-go, if that helps, and maybe we've talked a
couple of times. Well, anyway, my name is Joella, and I'm
running for Campus Relations Representative. I want to
be the CRR because I believe Student Council will be a lot
more effective when the campus has an idea of what's
being done during council meetings. To help spread the
information, I hope to increase coverage of Student
Council events in The Phoenix and Daily Gazette; that
way, people can be kept more up-to-date on what the
council is working on. I'll also take responsibility for
making sure that the council website is relevant, updated, and linked to the Portal. As a member of the council,
I want to improve Swatmail, get the voice-recognition
operating system back up for campus phones, increase
security lighting on the ways to PPR, Woolman, and
Whittier, and provide a 24-hour food source on campus.
So
remember your best friend in elementary school
who moved away but who promised that you'd always
keep in touch? Well, I actually will. Vote Joella for campus relations representative.

November 18, 2004

In my first two years at Swarthmore, I have become an
active member of our community, organizing community
service events and taking part in student activities, organizations and sports. I love Swarthmore, and as secretary, I
will work with the Student Budget Committee to ensure that
your interests are represented. As secretary, I will do everything in my power to make our school environment as fun,
interesting and exciting as it can possibly be by listening to
my fellow students and enacting several specific policies:
L I will work to increase the quality and availability of
food on campus. We must be able to get food after 10 p.m.,
beyond vending machine munchy food.
2. I will suggest that the administration take steps to
increase the availability of parking on campus. Larger parking facilities will allow us to increase our options beyond the
bustling metropolis that is the ville.
3.1 will work to increase student access to residence halls
on campus. Every student should have a key that allows

them to go into any other dorm without crawling through
windows at 2 a.m.
If elected secretary, I will ensure that all students have a
say in the decisions that affect our campus life.

CAMPUS LIFE REPRESENTATIVE

The campus life representative serves as the bridge
between the students and the school. This requires strong
leadership ability, good interpersonal skills and a fine
knowledge of the workings of the school. I have those abil-

ities. As an RA, I've been well acquainted with the work-

ings of the admin, and will be better equipped to find solutions to your problems.
I like Swat. It's my home away from home (Go

help you with that.
Vote Win.

Etan Nathaniel Cohen 'O7
Hey Hey! My name is Etan Cohen, and I am running for
campus life representative. From increasing the selection
of chips at Tarble to extending swim hours, the campus life
representative voices the concerns of Swatties in order to
improve the quality of life at Swarthmore. That's what I
want to continue doing! What do you all think about snack

machines in the science center or about late night food
options? How many of you feel that there need to be more
safety call boxes on campus? There's so much to do! Do you
all remember last year when I promised a book fair? Next
semester, an online book-buy-back program will exist for
students to buy textbooks more inexpensively. This past
semester, as campus relations representative, I was able to
start working on these many issues. Currently, I'm working with Dining Services to enhance food selection and
presentation. I want to continue this interaction to finish
what I have started. For that, I'll need your vote. Together,
we will make Swat a better place.
I would be honored to be a voice that represents my
peers. So just do it.
Vote for Etan.
Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Alexander Ginsberg 'OB
Some of you may know me from the articles I have written in The Phoenix, others from Rugby, Paces, DU or any
number of other groups on campus. I consider myself a
social person. I love to meet people, and I like to have a
good time. Most important to me, however, is that my
friends have a good time too. Thus, the decision to run for
campus life representative was simple. If elected, I will sit
on the Dean's advisory board and advocate the students'
every concern. How will I do this? Well, I will be accessible
and ready to listen to your ideas and complaints. As campus life rep, I will set up a weekly night of Coffee, Cookies
and Criticisms (CCC-New Deal Style baby!). In fact, so that
I can better grasp your ideas before taking office, come see
me this Wednesday, Nov. 17, at 9 p.m. in the Kohlberg
Lounge.
Personally, I notice things that can be improved (Read
about those at alexginsberg.tripod.com). I will work tirelessly for change. I promise to be an accessible representative and make this a productive year. Please remember,
vote for a candidate who will be available and will put out
for you! Vote Alex Ginsberg.

David Moore 'O6
I was made for this job. I have the ability to absorb the
concerns of many students. I work well in groups and I will
be a valuable asset to the dynamic of the SC. Here are two
of my ideas:
I propose cataloging all of the community service and
activism efforts of the students to provide us with easy
access to knowledge of what others are accomplishing. Not
only will this make it easier to reach out into the community, but it will also ensure that the volume and scope of
our efforts achieve their maximum potency. Concretely,
such cataloging will help existing groups by ensuring that
our limited funding is used to its maximum efficiency (I
love efficiency... and bubble gum).
I was outraged to find the Swarthmore Police harassing
and arresting students at the ML Halloween Party for the
second year in a row. This trend has to end immediately.
Therefore, if elected I will create a student group with the
full backing of the administration, whose sole purpose it
will be to maintain official relations with the Swarthmore
Police Department so students on college property will be
left to their own devices as they should be.
Rasa Petrauskaite 'OB
Get a Life! I would absolutely love to improve campus
life here. More campus wide communication will do the
job.

Were I to be elected, I would open up an online discus-

THE PHOENIX

sion forum where students would be able to post their suggestions for campus activities. I would moderate the forum
and occasionally summarize the relevant discussions of
events that go on in the Student Council. I would in turn
bring those discussions to the attention of other members
of the Student Council. This way, one would not have to
organize an event in order to drop a few suggestions for it
and have the student council consider them. Then, everyone would be able to participate in planning campus
events at will. Further, nobody would be left out. Consider
as well, when else would you be able to engage in a meaningful discussion with someone else who goes here whom
you haven't really met?

STUDENT EVENTS ADVISER
Jaime Cardenas 'O7
Hi, my name is Jaime Cardenas, and I'm running for
student events advisor. After a year at Swat, I feel that I
understand the community and would like to make some
changes that would improve the quality of the social life at
Swat.

SAC: The weekly Paces parties can get old and need a
viable alternative. I would propose that the school pick an
event each week, possibly a sporting event, concert, bowling or a movie. Students sign up for the event during the
week and then transportation is provided.
Student Council: Student Council often seems very
detached from the student body. The very people they are
representing often have no idea what projects Student
Council is working on. As a member of Student Council, I
would work to make sure the student body is wellinformed. Also, I would do everything I could to complete
the proposals I work on as quickly as possible, rather than
allowing them to drag on for years.
These are just a few of the ideas I have and the improvements that can be made with your support. Thank you for
your time.

the

role of the Student Council member who attends SAC meetings. As a liaison between Student Council and other student groups (including SAC), I will work diplomatically to

be unwilling to take a stand on important issues: I was one
of the SAC members who believed in the importance of
funding political events on campus. I'd like to expand the
opportunities for political dialogue, with an eye toward an
airing of diverse views. As importantly, this position exists
to connect students to life outside the Swarthmore bubble. I

important. I'd appreciate your vote!

it's crazy. I just say I'm from Maine.

Kyle White 'OB
Hi, my name is Kyle White and I am running for campus life representative. As an incoming freshman, I feel
that I have the abilities to bring new light to this campus
a fresh start, new ideas and better communication.
From experiences I have had as high school class president, as football captain, drama club president, and student council member, I believe that communication is the
most important resource for success. I hope to be the student's liaison within the Student Council at Swat and within the administration and faculty. Below are a few issues
I would to address:
-Final's Week: I urge the availability of Sharpies and
Essie Mae's for late night snacks during Final's Week. The
purpose is for open study area and light meals.
-Security: I propose the construction of a lighted path
from the SEPTA station to the east side of campus (to New
Dorm and Mertz vicinity).
I would appreciate your vote and remember: Kyle
White Does It Right.

Having spent this last semester as a member of
Social Affairs Committee, I am already familiar with

mean, Swatties work hard, and damn it we need a light at
the end of the tunnel. Thursday: Orgo exam. Friday:
Celebrating the Bolshevik Revolution over vodka shots.
You'll never be more excited to study.
2. Party Balance: I'm sorry, but SAC does a poor job
spreading parties out. We should have the option to party
both Friday and Saturday nights. I don't understand how
one night I need to choose between Olde Club or Paces, and
then the next night I'm subjected to watching Dirty
Dancing. We need options.

Emily Nolte 'O7
I am Emily Nolte and am running for student events advisor. The student events advisor acts as a liaison between
SAC, student groups and Student Council.
I am the best candidate because:
I have experience: on SAC for both of the last two semesters; current SAC secretary; active in the reevaluation of
SAC by-laws including incorporating funding for political

events.
I have goals: a quick, comprehensive, and positive conclusion to the SAC bylaws reevaluation; work with Public
Safety so students receive prompt and adequate responses to
issues of personal safety; increase awareness of Student
Council by recreating the SC bulletin board; encourage dialogue between the student body and council by hosting dis-

cussion forums at convenient times.
I am qualified: a campus leader as demonstrated by leadership positions in multiple campus groups; worked with
the administration as a member of the Parrish Building
Renovations, Dining Services, and Professor Search
Committees; organized and reliable as seen by perfect attendance at SAC meetings; approachable and willing to talk
with anyone about campus issues.
I am aware of the time and energy commitments associated with this position and pledge to represent you for the
full term. Please vote Emily Nolte for student events advisor.

Lizzy Vogel 'O7
Since Swarthmore is an intense academic experience, the

expectation of a fun weekend helps Swatties get through
their week. Unfortunately, most students do not attend the
meetings where major decisions about social events are
made; it is easy to feel left out of the process. As your elected student events advisor, I would strive to bring together
the concerns of students and decision-makers to provide students with a satisfactory variety of social options each week.
I would encourage all students to contact me personally with
any questions, suggestions or concerns about the Swat social
scene, so I can ensure that they are addressed at both
Student Council and SAC meetings. Furthermore, in the
past, Student Council has shied away from making political
decisions. Rather than avoiding these decisions all together,
Student Council should step up to best represent the political views of the student body. If elected, I would not shy away
from making these decisions but would instead make these
decisions my priority. Swarthmore has amazing resources
that should be used to further the social and political awareness that makes our school unique, and if elected, I will do
my part to ensure that Student Council does this.

Dan Sartori 'OB
The position of student events advisor requires a student who has a desire to facilitate the opportunities made
available to students with the aim of presenting an open
and encouraging social environment for all to partake in. I
have an interest in the social affairs at Swarthmore and
hope to bolster the student body's unity through the posi-

tion of events advisor. Swarthmore College students are
surrounded by opportunities in the academic realm. As
these offerings are beneficial components of an education
at a small liberal arts college, student-run events provide a
form of interaction that is just as important. My goal, if
elected as student events advisor, will be to unite student
events with the hope of bringing about a more unified campus. Rather than always having a themed event available,
as if to constantly accommodate separate groups, having
consolidated events that the entire campus can become
involved in and get excited over will bring students together and create a more vibrant social atmosphere. Some campuses rally around a football team, some around a music
Swarthmore is
program, some around their reputation
unique in that students get excited over each other's abilities, talents, backgrounds. Student events should be
forums to extend this interest.

Biggie and Tupac. Where would we be without conflict (don't
say "alive and happy")? We mean, have you ever watched The
History Channel? No? Oh. Well, it's all about conflict, baby
whenever it's not too obtrusive we're throw(side note here
ing in "baby" to get ready for March Madness). This revelation
came to us after last
Thursday's Pub Night (you'd
be surprised how many of
our substantial ideas start
there), where we saw our
friend, Ryan Lewis, get handled by a certain bully, (Ms.)
Myra Kate Vallianos. In the
spirit of Ryan getting his ass

whooped, we'd like to break

down some of the sports
world's greatest feuds:

SAM BELL
SAM BRECKENRIDGE
The Dirty Corner

Jamal Mashburn vs.
Jimmy Jackson vs. Jason
Kidd: There's always a girl

involved. Rumor has it that
über-diva Toni Braxton ("Unbreak My Heart") couldn't
decide
which
Dallas
m^^^^^m^^^^^^^^^mmm
Maverick guard to kiss. If we
were in her shoes, we would
have held onto JKidd because he's smart (Berkeley), plays like
Sammy and isn't cute enough to be followed around by groupies.
Toni couldn't pick so she held onto all three. By the end of the '96'97 campaign, eight assists had been recorded between the three,
the team finished 24-58, and the three J's, traded to Miami, Jersey
and Phoenix, were Toni-less.
Mike Piazza vs. Roger Clemens: We've all seen the cinematic masterpiece "Bull Durham." And we remember Kevin
Costner, the catcher, telling the opposing batters what his own
pitcher, Tim Robbins, was about to throw. It's called "tipping,"
and we think Piazza did it to Clemens at this year's All Star
game. In what was supposed to be a nice moment in his home-

town and at the end of a Hall-of-Fame career, Clemens was tattooed by the American League bums. Now, throwing at people's
heads is part of baseball Mike understands that. But by throwing sharp pieces of a splintered bat at Piazza, as Clemens did in
the 2000 World Series, he humiliated a confused Mike on national television and shattered the polite traditions of the baseball
brawl by incorporating ill-conceived dodgeball practices.
Nancy Kerrigan vs. Tonya Harding: Maybe your mom
was right: you just shouldn't hang out with certain kinds of
people. Unfortunately for Nancy, that's nearly impossible in
the world of figure skating. How does a sport with glitter, pink
jumpsuits and a Yanni soundtrack attract such thugs? Prior to
the 1994 Olympics, a jealous Tonya hired some muscle to take
out her prettier and more refined American teammate. At least
a metal pipe was her
they had a flair for the dramatic
weapon of choice. In the end, an overweight Tonya found herself foxy boxing in casinos throughout the Southwest, Nancy
came home with a silver medal, and the gold went to another
upstanding lady (hiccup), the 16-year-old drunk Oksana Baiul.
Terrell Owens vs. the Baltimore Ravens: If you are dumb
enough to pick a fight with a group of men who are paid to hit
you, why would you pick the ones that hit hardest? That's exactly what TO. did after he realized that Kyle Boiler would be his
QB in Baltimore, eventually strong-arming the Ravens to trade
him to your Philly Eagles. The Ravens GM called TO. selfish,
and TO. labeled him a racist. And then three weeks ago when the
-

Eagles humiliated the Ravens and Ray Lewis, TO. committed

a

cardinal football sin: he mocked another man's end zone dance.
You just don't do that. Lewis knows people. And according to
Ray, the hardest of the Ravens on and off the field, TO. is forgiven. He's taking the high road, but is that just rhetoric? We think
the high road leads to the back of T.O.'s head when these two
meet again
in the Pro Bowl. Every year, half of the Ravens'
defense gets an invitation to Honolulu. That means that, in a
game that usually resembles two-hand touch, TO. is going to get
...

knocked around. We smell a Robert Brooks-like injury.
Alright, here's a couple more that didn't quite make the cut,
but they're fun to chew on. Baby.
Kobe vs. Shaq (the best is yet to come), Qyntel Woods vs.
PETA (a little one-sided), CWebb vs. Nellie (the most low-energy feud ever), PJ vs. Sprewell (according to Latrell, it wasn't
that serious
"I wasn't going to kill him"), Iverson vs. his
teammates ("We're talking about practice!? They should be
used to playing with me. Those are my teammates"), and Big
Shot Ahmmad vs. Ramrod (daggers, all daggers ...).

Nowak in the 500-meter freestyle,
finishing in a time of 4:57.63 to
Nowak's 4:57.98. Taylor won the 200
IM in 2:05.07, then triumphed in
the 100-meter backstroke, touching
the wall at 57.42. Koczo was also an
individual two-event winner, taking both the 50-meter freestyle
(22.78) and the 100-meter breastroke (1:01.84). Auerbach represented the upperclassmen with victories in two freestyle events, the ,100
(49.34) and the 200 (1:48.74).
Swarthmore also took both relays
in the meet to secure the win. A
team of Koczo, Taylor, Jeff
Schneider 'O5, and Reid Johnson
'OB opened up the meet with a victory in the 200 medley relay in
1:42.91. To close out the afternoon,
Frampton,
Auberach,
Jason
Horwitz 'O7, and Jonathan Augat
'O7 took gold in the 200 freestyle
relay in 1:30.6 L With the victory,
the men improved to 2-1 on the season and remained a perfect 2-0 in
the Centennial Conference.
"The men's team swam pretty
amazingly all across the board,"
coach Sue Davis said. "That meet
couldn't have been won without
each and everyone there that

Swat and F&M swimmers square off in the breaststroke

swam." Davis noted especially the
performances of Frampton, who
swam lifetime bests in his events,
and Auerbach.
The underclassmen also led the
charge for the women, who's first
loss gave them a 2-1 record (1-1 in
the Centennial Conference) on the
young season. Franny Zhang 'OB
won the 200-meter freestyle in
1:59.79, then came back later in the
afternoon to take the 100-meter
freestyle as well (55.12). Jennie
Lewis 'OB beat out the competition
for a first place finish in the 100meter butterfly in 1:00.31 and also
finished a close second in the 50meter freestyle in 25.55.
Katherine Reid 'O5 was the other
individual event winner for the
Garnet, taking the 1000-meter

freestyle in 11:03.90. Reid was also

the runner-up in the 500-meter
freestyle with a time of 5:28.24.
Swarthmore also took the 200-meter
freestyle relay in 1:4316 with strong
performances by Zhang, Lewis,
Sarah Cotcamp 'O7 and Whitney
Nekoba 'OB.
Davis acknowledged the contribution the underclassmen were
making on the teams. "That's why
I recruited them," she said. But she
also warned not to overlook the
presence that all of the swimmers
made in the meet. "Don't discount
the upperclassmen at all," Davis

said.

The Garnet's next meet will be
this Saturday at NYU, the first of
three consecutive away meets

before winter break.

Men’s XC finishes season at Regionals
BY DARCY NELSON

dnelsonl@swarthmore.edu
The men's cross country team, led by Lang
Reynolds 'O5 and James Golden 'O5, captured seventh
place at the NCAA Mid East Regional Cross Country
Championship on Saturday morning at Allegheny
College. The harriers braved cold weather to run 8K
alongside runners from 34 other schools in the region.
"The starting line seemed to go on forever," Keefe

Keeley 'O6 said. Reynolds earned All-Region honors for

the fourth consecutive time, taking 22nd place with a
time of 26:42.
Reynolds, the 2003 Centennial Conference Runner of
the Year, was hoping for more. "I was really hoping to
qualify for Nationals, and I was about ten spots off from
that, which was disappointing because I've been shooting for that since I was a sophomore," Reynolds said.
Reynolds was 18th at the regional meet as a freshman,
25th as a sophomore, 11th as a junior. "I've always been
really close to qualifying for nationals, but I've never
made it, which is frustrating," Reynolds said. The
national qualifying criteria change every year. This
year the top two teams and the top eight individuals
outside of those teams were invited to run at the

national meet.

The weather played a factor for the runners. "It
was really cold, which I'm not used to. I went out with
the leaders and was feeling good until about the three
mile mark," Reynolds said. As the other runners
began to pick up the pace, Reynolds was uncharacteristically not able to hang on. "I didn't feel at all good

the last mile, although I'm not sure why. My legs just

felt dead. I felt like I couldn't get any power from
them, like I was moving in slow motion. I don't know
if it was the cold or what, but I was definitely fading,"
Reynolds said.
Golden crossed the line seventeen seconds after
Reynolds, walking away with a time of 26:59, 32nd
place, and all-region honors for the first time in his
career. The next five harriers to finish were Keeley,

Garrett Ash 'O5, Jim Kreft 'O6, Adam Hunt 'O6, and Ross
Weller 'OB. Each crossed the line within a minute of one
another. Keeley finished 49th (27:26), Ash took 55th
(27:33), Kreft was 70th (27:45), Hunt claimed 75th (27:54),
and Weller came in 87th (28:06). "We had a solid but not
great race," Reynolds said. "James [Golden] ran well
and Keefe [Keeley] ran really well. I feel like we really
could have beaten Dickinson, but their 4-5 guys came
through and had better races than ours," Reynolds
said.
As with every team, there have been ups and
downs to the season for the Garnet harriers. "We've
been struggling all season to put the pieces together
with everybody having a good race at the same time,
and we struggled with that again on Saturday.
Conferences was perhaps our best race of the season

as a team," Reynolds said.
Keeley was proud of the team. "Regionals was a
strong snowing. We had our sights up pretty high,"
Keeley said. "It was a solid close to a solid season. I
was proud of Lang and James for putting together the
all-region performance that they did. It's a privilege
to run with those guys. They're real warriors."

170th in 27:13. "It was wonderful to see all our work

come together in the meet
we've been training for
months," Ritter said. "In
such a large field in less
than perfect conditions, the
entire team ran smart races,
just like we'd been practicing all season long."
The total team score for
the Garnet was 233. The
meet was the last for fouryear runner Gardner, and
An Bui 'O5 and Maila Sepri
'O5. "The team will certainly
miss our graduating seniors, who brought a great
positive attitude to our work
every day," Ritter said.
"Carrie has had a great
season so I was happy to see
her cap it off by winning an

said. "She's worked really
and
definitely

far as personal records,
Hobbs could not easily compare the regional race to
previous races of the season.
"It's hard to compare
times because all of the
courses are really different.
You can't compare it like you
can on a track," Hobbs said.
The

November

weather was not as severe
as expected. "I was prepared

for it to be really cold,"
Hobbs said. "All week,
everyone was getting ready
to freeze their butt of, but
the sun came out for the
girls' race."
Still, the cold definitely
was a factor in the race. "It
was a pretty chilly day with
a fair amount of wind which
made it difficult to run real-

ly fast even though

the
course itself wasn't that difficult," Davis said.
In order to brave the
cold, Hobbs ran with a
swimsuit under her uniform. "It looked funny. I
passed a girl in the second
mile and she turned to me
and asked me if I was wearing a swimsuit." Regardless,
Hobbs was able to stay
warm for the course and finish with a national-qualifying time.
"I think it was most
exciting for me because this
whole season has been so
unexpected. It's not as if I
just started running, but I
went into the season just
hoping that I might be AllConference," Hobbs said.
She will be the
lone
Swarthmore runner at the
national meet. Her teammates will be missed.
"Training this week by
myself makes me realize
how much having a team
makes a sport fun," she said.

That loud clicking noise you may have heard last week was not
just the annoying kid in your economics class who can't stop fiddling with his pen. While there were still plenty of pens clicking
around campus, the major source
of the noise was coming from all
those baseball fans, who, two
weeks after the last out of the
World Series, finally turned their
TVs off in disappointment because
they realized that college football
and "Seinfeld" cannot adequately
revive the excitement (and the procrastination) of playoffs past. And
so, as the excitement of October
and the first weeks of November

began to fade into the cold of winter like footsteps in the leaves, we

MATTHEW DRAPER

Rocks with Sticks

were suddenly faced with the dire
prospect that we might actually
have to get some work done.
Just as I was preparing to confront this bleak reality, however, I

was rescued from the depths by
that other fall pastime, cheering
for Swarthmore football...
No, I'm not kidding. Swarthmore football enjoyed a bang-up
reason this year, finishing with a winning record (12-7-2) for the
first time in 4,082 years (or maybe 4,083, the records aren't clear),
earning third in the Centennial Conference and second in the
ECAC South Region championship (The NIT of Div 111 Soccer).
Riding a staunch defense (the Great Wall of Garnet), an opportunistic offense, and a flamboyant goalie who once met Miss
America, the Garnet Tide was able to put together its best season
in years while also bringing legions of Swat athletes together as
fans in large numbers. (For those of you who are still confused,
please look up the definition of football as used by the 6.8 billion
people who weren't born in the US.)
Now I don't want to rock the We-hate-Al-Bloom boat too much,
but let me just say, maybe he was right. This marks the first year
our athletic teams are made of four complete, post*football recruiting classes, and it also marks the first year the soccer team puts
together a successful campaign. Coincidence? Maybe. Or maybe
not. The whole idea behind cutting the football team was not to piss
everybody off, it was to take the resources that were being spent on
•one team and spread it among all the other teams. Take the money
that used to go into football pads and helmets and put it into a
sparkling new turf field, and suddenly Nathan Shupe 'O5 doesn't
have to slip in the mud every time he goes up to grab a Haverford
corner kick. Add some bright lights to that field, and now the soccer team can play games at night, when more fans can come and
scream at the refs and side judges and "encourage" them to make
bad calls for our side. Give more slots in each admissions pool to
the other teams, and we get better recruiting classes. Football used
to take up 25 or so slots. Spread those around, and now even the golf
team gets a couple. I don't really know the specifics for soccer, but
I bet that the extra slots and the new field certainly helped lure such
fine first-year specimens as Brandon Washington 'OB and Michael
Bonesteel 'OB, among others, to our respected institution. This
whole team, in fact, was built on the extra slots freed up by the disappearance of the football team.
This is, of course, a simplistic explanation. Ask many a school
ground the country and you will quickly find that a shiny new field
and larger recruiting classes do not necessarily a good team make.
More important factors for the soccer team have been stability at
coach
this is Eric Wagner's third year
as well as Wagner's disciplined and demanding style that ensured that the only people
playing on the soccer team were those who really wanted to work
hard (I wasn't the only one rolling my eyes last spring as my
friends got up for 7 a.m. off-season workouts). And so once we give
credit where credit is due, let's remember: Al Bloom, and all those
he represents, certainly did nothing that directly affected this
team's success, but in this author's humble opinion, they helped
create the environment in which such a team could come to be. Al
may not have been the finest athlete at his college, but I'd venture
he cares more about Swat athletics than most people think, and we
may just be seeing the school board's bold decision beginning to
pay off for our Swat sports teams. So when next fall rolls around,
and you find yourself staring longingly at the 100,000 fans at
University of Michigan games wondering why Swat can't be like
that, get off your butt and go see the football team that's still on
Campus. They might be a little better than you think.

One game short of a title
Tide falls 3-1 to Wesley College ia finals of ECAC tournament
BY TARIQ FISCHER

The Tide finally had to roll in.
Coming off a powerful victory in the quarterfinals
against Lebanon Valley on Nov. 10, the Garnet
marched onto Clothier field on Saturday ready to bury
Washington and Jefferson. By the end of the game, the
scoreboard showed Swat 5, W & J 3. The Presidents,
playing like the living dead, probably had a hard time
reading the score from six feet underground.
However, the season seemed to be in jeopardy of
ending prematurely after the Presidents took a 1-0
lead with 19 minutes left in the first half. Tide fans,
used to one- or two-goal games, were worried
even
with the home team up 2-1
after Duncan Gromko
'O7 saved what would have been the tying score on
the goal line. Those worries were unfounded as the
Garnet answered with five consecutive goals to seal
up the game tighter than an Al Gore lockbox.
The Presidents' term was up. The players packed
up their equipment and prepared to leave, with five
minutes left in the game. Coach Eric Wagner used the
big lead to change the rotation. "We had a lot of new
players in all at once. [The W & J goals] were a little
disappointing, but totally understandable," Wagner
said. W J scored two goals towards the very end of
the match, but, given Swat's Charmin-esque four-goal
cushion, they mattered less than a Florida absentee
ballot; the Tide's place was booked in Sunday's finals.
The finals against Wesley kicked off Sunday after&

noon. Officiating was unusually tight, and the
Wolverines were awarded a free kick in the 12th
minute. Fragile-looking striker Evan Myers took
advantage of the call and the resulting picturesque
cross, heading home the first goal of the game to give
the visitors a 1-0 advantage.
Deja vu? The Tide comeback in the finals was not
as overpowering as Saturday's. "After we went down
a goal on Sunday, we went to a three defender formtion," Wagner said, explaining the adjustment to provide more offense. "It was a valuable and necessary
risk, but it didn't work out for us."

formation in the 56th minute to give Wesley a 2-0
lead. Brandon Washington 'OB scored a goal in the
62nd minute to pull the Tide within one. The bewildered Wesley keeper demonstrated the reaction time
of a sloth as he watched the ball roll into the net.
A third Wesley goal in the 69th minute left the
score at 3-1, but the Tide just would not simply roll
over. Kirk Ellison dropped a spectacular volley behind
the still-confused Wolverine goalie but officials ruled
to call back the goal, ending the Garnet charge.
Coach Wagner was impressed with the Wesley
effort. "They were absolutely clicking; all of their

goals were quality," Wagner said. When questioned

about the officiating, Wagner explained "you never
win or lose games because of the refs."
The 2004 campaign has been remarkable in every
sense of the word. The team broke records in scoring,
beat Haverford, made the playoffs, and earned a bid
to a postseason tournament. "We achieved every goal
we set at the beginning of the season and more,"
Washington said.
Why was the team so successful this season? "I told
them at halftime on Sunday 'nothing but your absolute
best will suffice,'" Wagner said. "I am absolutely certain that they gave everything they had." That success
should carry over as the team prepares for 2005.
"There's a different attitude towards off-season training," Wagner said. "This team is no longer the seventhplace doormat of the conference. Now we have a target
on our back." A strong recruiting class should combine with returning leaders to stack the roster higher
than the dirty dishes in Peter Griffin's dorm room.
However, the team's most important achievement
came off the field. An average of more than 200 fans
attended home matches this season. Three Swatties
dug out old cheerleading uniforms to wear to last
weekend's games (but notably misspelled "SWAT").
Roy Sriwattanakomen 'O5 was kicked out of
Saturday's game for hardcore .cheering. The Garnet
Club hosted tailgates for evening games. This campus, famous for its apathetic reputation regarding
sports, has become aware of its newfound athletic
muscle. This sleepy school has woken up. The
Centennial Conference should be very, very afraid.
