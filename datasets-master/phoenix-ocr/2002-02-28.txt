College launches fund
Board decides
to cover aid for raising campaign in NYC
drug offenders The Meaning of Swarthmore' aims to raise $230 million
Decision is 'consistent with
stands' of past, Bloom says
BY SETH SIAS

ssiasl@swarthmore.edu
The Board of Managers has approved a policy mandating that the college replace financial aid the federal government denies to students with drug convictions beginning next year.

"Students who have been convicted of drug offenses are
not eligible to receive federal student aid" because of a law
passed in 1998 that will go into effect for the next academic year, Director of Financial Aid Laura Talbot said.
Replacing money denied to students with drug convictions "is consistent with stands we have taken in the past,"
President Al Bloom said.
For example, "in 1983, the college joined with 10 other
schools to state publicly that we thought that access to education should not be linked with the Selective Service
requirement," Talbot said.
"I believe that the decision with respect to registration
for the draft had to do with protecting students' rights to
acts of conscience," Maurice Eldridge '6L vice president
for college and community relations, said. However, he
added, "it is bad policy to use federal funds intended to
expand access to higher education as a means of enforcing

drug laws."

"We should continue our policy of
providing for financial need to the
extent that it's needed."
BOM Chair Larry Shane '56
"It was our sense that our current policy would entail
that we meet that obligation" to make sure that any student accepted by Swarthmore would be able to enroll here,
Bloom said, explaining the rationale behind making up aid
lost to drug offenders.
"There were absolutely no objections at all" to making
such replacements at the Board of Managers' meeting, the
board's chair, Larry Shane '56, said. "We should continue
our policy of providing for financial need to the extent that
it's needed."
The decision to replace this aid prompted a change in
admissions policy. A question on the application reads,
"Have you been suspended or dismissed from any school?
(If so, please explain fully on a separate sheet)." Now the
college "will be asking about criminal record" on the application according to Bloom.
The wording of the new question is still up in the air. It

suspended, dismissed or subjected to any school-related or

After months of delay following the Sept. 11 attacks,
"The Meaning of Swarthmore" finally had its first coming-out party Saturday night, a gala for 350 alumni and
friends of the college on New York's Upper East Side.
The evening event, held at the Asia Society on Park
Avenue and 70th Street, was first intended as a regional
launch of the college's six-year, $230-million fundraising
campaign. But the event took on new importance after
the on-campus launch scheduled for Sept. 22 was canceled.
"I invite you to raise your glasses to the future of
Swarthmore," President Al Bloom announced to the
champagne-wielding crowd, inaugurating the first official party in the fundraising campaign.
The evening's main event was a multimedia presentation hosted by "60 Minutes" executive producer David
Gelber '63. In the highly scripted 40-minute show, Gelber
introduced three recent Swarthmore graduates from the
classes of 2000 and 2001 whose stories were told through
a combination of pre-produced short films and on-stage
appearances.

Jacob Krich 'OO, Desiree Peterkin 'OO and Vasya

Dostoinov 'Ol were the three featured alumni that
evening. Krich, a physics major, earned a Rhodes scholarship and was flown in from Oxford to appear. Peterkin
told the story of her rise to Swarthmore through the program A Better Chance (ABC) and her career as a track
star. Dostoinov's story portrayed the death of his father
freshman year as an emotional moment in his journey
from a childhood in the USSR to his current consulting
job in New Jersey. Leaya Lee 'O2 performed a solo violin
piece by Bach but did not speak.
Each alumnus gave a pre-rehearsed speech and, while
none of them directly asked for money, the presentation
had a clear financial pitch: If Swarthmore is to continue
giving young adults the opportunities these students
had, it requires the support of all alumni.
The show was produced professionally by Mark
Edwards & Co. According to Director of Development
John Malcolm, Mark Edwards is the premiere producer
of campaign launch and closure videos in the country.
The company worked with the college over several
months to hone the content and message of the presentation.
This performance was separate from another video
produced for Swarthmore, called "The Meaning of
Swarthmore." That short film was produced by Jon
Huberth and Vern Oakley.
Before and after the evening show, alumni and guests
mixed and mingled in the glass-encased lobby of the Asia
Society. They were treated to gourmet hors d'oeuvres and
a selection of wine and champagne.
The Board of Managers and most senior administrators attended. All alumni in the New York area were

alumni included Eugene Lang '3B and James Hormel '55,
former ambassador to Luxembourg and onetime stakeholder in the Hormel Food Corporation.

Malcolm said.
Malcolm would not reveal the total cost of the
evening's events or of the multimedia presentation. Tom

Endowment falls, tuition rises

In fact, Bock said, there is a lot of information the college does not request from applicants. He cited a case in
which a convicted murderer enrolled at Princeton and was
later kicked out for lying about his grades. A more refined
question about criminal records on Swarthmore's application might keep a similar situation from occurring at here.
And that's the goal of such a question. Knowing about
applicants' criminal records may reveal something about
their character. Bock thinks that character is important in
building the Swarthmore community. The question is

Tuition increase will be higher than expected

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Hike in costs not endowment-affected, officials say; increase is higher at other schools
BY JARED LENOW
jlenowl@swarthmore.edu
An unusually large increase in staffand
faculty compensation costs will drive
tuition up at a rate higher than normal
next year.
Tuition will increase 4.5 percent, from
$34,538 to $36,092, which is .35 percent more
than the targeted increase of 415 percent.
The college normally aims to increase
tuition by the rate of inflation plus L 5 percent.
"This is just a routine process that we
go through every year," Paul Aslanian,
vice president of finance and planning,
said. "That's what we needed to meet our

costs."

Many students found the increase reasonable.
"I don't find it very surprising," Andy
Scarborough 'O4 said. "You have to consider the impact of things such as the living
wage resolution, the cost of the new science
center and the recent downturn in the
economy."

"Our decline is much less
significant than that
experienced by other
endowments."
Treasurer Sue Welsh
Others questioned the necessity of the
larger than normal increase.
"Financial decisions like this make me
question the planning capabilities of the
administration to some degree," Tim Lang
'O4 said. "I am fairly sure that the steadily
growing cost of the science center project
had something to do with this, and I know
that better planning could have curbed
spending."

Aslanian blamed the increase on skyrocketing healthcare costs, the newly instituted minimum wage for staff, the need to
keep staff salaries competitive, and an

obligation to meet goals for faculty compensation. He did not attribute the increase
to the economic downturn and decrease in
the endowment, which currently stands at
$925 million.

"We're not crying wolf and saying that
the endowment being down is driving up
fees," Aslanian said. "It's really about
human resources. Our biggest mover on
the expenditure side from year to year is
compensation costs. If costs for a given
year happen to go up more than our normal
increase in fees, it puts a strain on our

David L. Warren, president of the National
Association of Independent Colleges and
Universities, said that "an economic downturn negatively affects every other university revenue source. It affects corporate

and foundation giving, earnings from
endowments and fund raising from alumni
and friends. Tuition is the one revenue
stream over which independent universities have control."

Statistics on the endowment

budget."

While the faltering market has sapped
Swarthmore's endowment, the school's
investment portfolio has proved remarkably resilient.
"Our decline is much less significant
than that experienced by other endowments," Sue Welsh, treasurer of the college,
said. "Our endowment is similar to others
in that it is composed largely of stocks and
equities but differs in that we invest less in
technology and venture capital, which, in
this particular downturn, were more hard

hit."
However, Aslanian said the school's
budget is relatively independent of fluctua-

tions in the value of the endowment.
Unlike most schools, who spend a given
percentage of endowment every year,
Swarthmore earmarks a fixed amount
from the endowment each year for the

budget."

"Other schools are in much more of a
bind because of the way they spend the
income from the endowment," Aslanian
said. "Our approach is to insulate the budget from market volatility. Of course, obviously, in the long run, if you have a sustained downturn, and our endowment

spending was gobbling up a lot of our
endowment, we'd change our policy, but
that is not likely."
Swarthmore's spending philosophy sets
it apart from most schools and allows it to
sidestep the hiring freezes, budget crunches and larger tuition increases that are now
commonplace in the academic world.

College receives $1 million for Japan studies
Grant will allow addition of three faculty members to teach language, literature and culture
BY KRISNA

DUONG-LY

kduongll@swarthmore.edu

A $1 million grant from The Freeman Foundation will
allow the college to create three new faculty positions to
teach Japanese language, literature and culture for at
least four years, according to Ellen Wylie, Swarthmore's
director of corporate, foundation and government
relations.

Wylie drafted the proposal in the fall in response to an
invitation from The Freeman Foundation, an organization dedicated to supporting Asian studies at colleges
and universities, after faculty members and students
expressed a desire to see Japanese included in the college's academic program.
The college hopes to hire one assistant professor and
one instructor in the modern languages and literatures

department to teach Japanese language and literature.
Additionally, the college aims to include courses taught
in English about Japanese culture and media. The grant
will also underwrite an assistant professor to teach
courses about Japanese society in the sociology and
anthropology department.
The remaining funds will support students studying

Japanese during the summer, improve the collection of
Asia-related materials in McCabe, purchase Japanese
language software, and provide funds for faculty travel
to explore study abroad options in Asia.

"This will allow the college to have
better coverage of such an
important part of the world."
Alan Berkowitz, Asian studies chair
During the program's third year, the college will
decide whether to permanently include Japanese as part
of the Asian studies program, which now concentrates
on Chinese language and culture. In the past, there have
been several student-run Japanese courses on
Swarthmore's campus. However, currently, studentsmust commute to Haverford College and occasionally to the University of Pennsylvania to take Japanese
language courses. The Swarthmore program will alleviFebruary 28, 2002

ate most of this problem by offering a few beginning-level
courses, but students who wish to study Japanese at an
advanced level may still have to commute.
About one-fourth of the student body takes courses in
Asian studies, said program chair Alan Berkowitz. Like
other faculty members, he wants the college to offer more
Asian languages and cultures. "This will allow the college to have better coverage of such an important part of
the world," he said.
The departments involved in hiring candidates
sociology and anthropology and modern languages and
literatures
have already started their search and plan
to allow students to meet candidates. "Student input is
very important to us," said Hansjakob Werlen, chair of
the modern languages and literatures department.
Werlen, a German professor, said it is very important
for the college to offer an interdisciplinary program in
Japanese. Miguel Diaz-Barriga, acting chair of the sociology and anthropology department, stressed the need to
offer more opportunities like this one to students. "We
want our students to take classes on different parts of the
world," he said, "so that they can have a global perspec-

tive on contemporary issues."

Reporter's Notebook: The capital campaign launch

In New York, a search for 'Meaning'
Y JUSTIN KANE
;anel@swarthmore.edu
Meaning is difficult to come by these days. We hem and
haw over our words, say it isn't possible, denigrate it,
nake it relative and deconstruct it. Yet there they were,
550 alumni and guests, relishing "The Meaning of
Swarthmore" at Saturday night's plush capital campaign
aunch in New York City.
As a student, it was hard to hold out much hope for the
>ven t
God knows we've learned by now not to put our
aim in spectacle
but there was some allure to it, aside
rom the open bar. I like meaning; who doesn't, after all?
So just what was the Meaning of Swarthmore unveiled
it the Asia Society? If you want to get specific, you could
•efer to the college's case statement for the campaign,
which tells us that "The Meaning of Swarthmore is about
(reserving the meaning of Swarthmore." It's kind of clever
f you don't think about it for too long.
} But the meaning of Swarthmore revealed at the launch
was less clever than visceral and thoroughly unapologetic.
The opening of the bar was well-timed, about two hours
before the staging of the meaning-laden "multimedia proiuction." Chardonnay, Sancerre and Sapporo flowed freely
in the glass-enclosed atrium of the newly renovated Asia
Society, the commotion of conversation and of old friendships renewed floating to the top of the shocks of bamboo
scaling the glass walls. By the time the alumni were ushered into the wood-paneled Lila Acheson Wallace
~rium to hear the shill, they were drunk and happy.
The production was positively cathartic. It built you up,
tracked a few jokes, patted you on the back, walked you
lown Memory Lane, sang and danced for you, and then
erked the tears straight out of your eyes. It was beautiful
and seductive and manipulative, and you hated yourself for
loving it. "I'm a sucker for that," James Hormel '55 said.
\ And it did it all without mentioning the word "money."
In the past, the college would put some bunting in the gym,
fill the floor with tables, some speeches, dinner, and voila!
that was the campaign. It was low-key, apologetic, a necessary evil, an affair brief and best forgotten.
But Saturday's events were like the machinations of a
high-class hooker, angling for the affections of some nouveau riche. She was beautiful, he was drunk. He had the
cash, she knew just how to spend it. It was unbearable to
watch, but you couldn't look away. The dim consciousness
that, underneath the spectacle, there was some transaction

taking place was enough to make even the intoxicated
wince. As Mark Risk '7B said, "If the messages were subliminal, the giving would be simpler."
The fact that alumni still labor under the terms of giving is telling. But Derrida exploded the notion of the gift
some years ago, and the men in the development office
know that. They also know that Swarthmore wealth still
requires an apologia, and they're prepared to write it.
Ted Mills, director of planned giving at the college, said
that the Meaning of Swarthmore isn't about money but
about building a new relationship between the college and
its alumni. "You avoid asking for the money," he said in an
earlier interview. "You bring people to the point where
they can't resist giving."
Mills realizes that "giving" has become a misnomer.

"You have to find out what's important to the donor and
then find out what at Swarthmore would satisfy them as a
way of exercising their values of the world," he said. "You
don't think, 'l'm trying to get 500 grand from this person.'
You think, 'l'm trying to bring this person very close to the
college, to the point where it's the natural thing to give.'
Of course, somewhere underneath this touchy-feeliness
lies the more concrete goal of raising $230 million. But the
Meaning of Swarthmore is, in the end, a didactic campaign
about the meaning of Swarthmore.
"People don't give money away naturally," college vice
president Dan West said. "It's not something that people do
genetically. It's something that people have to learn to do,

"

like learning to swim or learning to ride a bicycle."
And that's the meaning? Well, sure. Why not?

Board offers tenure positions to six professors
IY BRENDAN KARCH

ikarchl@swarthmore.edu

The Board of Managers granted tenure to six faculty
members at its meeting last Saturday in New York City.
History professors Allison Dorsey and Bruce Dorsey
(who are unrelated), statistics professor Philip Everson,
political science professor Keith Reeves 'BB, head women's
basketball coach Adrienne Shibles and biology professor
Elizabeth Vallen all received tenure. All will be promoted
[rom the position of assistant professor to associate professor except Reeves, who came to Swarthmore as an associate professor.
Professors are usually relieved to hear about the decision, which comes after months of intense scrutiny from
•he college. "I have been walking a few inches off the
ground since Saturday," Vallen said.
For Allison Dorsey, the emotions were stronger than
relief. "I felt and continue to feel a tremendous sense of
shock," she said.
The tenure decision, which usually comes at the end of
Professors' sixth year at Swarthmore, determines their
future at the college. If granted tenure, the professor has

members passed over for tenure.
Drumm and his wife, Aimee Johnson, had been sharing
one tenure-track math position. In order for the position to
be approved, they both needed to be recommended for
tenure. He was not recommended, and they made no judgment on her.
Rejection came as an immense disappointment.
"Devastated would be a good word to describe how I felt,"
Drumm said. "Mixed with just a little anger and a feeling
of failure."

"To my mind, the greatest stress
was the not knowing."
Professor Allison Dorsey
According to Provost Connie Hungerford, who serves
on the Committee on Promotion and Tenure, the review
process lasts several months. In the fall, each candidate's
department assembles a dossier for the committee. Outside
scholars from the professor's field, faculty members in the
department, faculty members outside the department and
about 25 students all offer comments on the candidate.
Outside scholars critique the candidate's research and
scholarship, while professors and students speak to the
professor's teaching ability and qualities as a colleague.
According to Hungerford, about equal weight is placed on
February 28, 2002

teaching and on scholarship in the tenure decision.
The process can be notoriously harrowing for professors. "To my mind, the greatest stress was the not knowing," said Allison Dorsey. "At some point, I simply wanted
to know, yes or no, and was frankly willing to accept
either, just so long as the process was over."
The college also conducts a serious review of tenuretrack professors after their third year at the college. The
review sometimes results in termination of a faculty member's contract, but more often than not, professors receive
advice from colleagues and administration for the sixthyear tenure decision.
According to Hungerford, the "primary reason" for
tenure is "to safeguard academic freedom." Tradition in
academia dictates that tenured professors cannot be
hounded or fired for questionable intellectual views.
Allison Dorsey said she would not change her teaching
or research plans because of tenure. But Vallen noted, "It
may allow me to take a few more risks in my research
pursuing things that are a little less of a sure shot."
Despite the inherent stress of the tenure review
process, professors had generally kind words for the
administration's conduct in the process.
"I thought the Provost, Connie Hungerford, and my
chair, Pieter Judson, were formal, professional and
direct," Allison Dorsey said, "which is about all anyone
can hope for while their entire adult career is being judged
and evaluated."

Athletics fields may be built in Crum
With
calling for
athletics

more field space, college investigates locating fields in Crum Woods

BY MARY MINTEL
mmitnell@swarthmore.edu

The soccer teams play on the softball

field. That is, when the intramurals aren't
using it.

Many athletic fields are used by more

than one sport. And since the seasons overlap, this presents a major problem to the

athletics department.
To solve this, the Land Use Planning

"The Crum has a rich
forest interior that will be
seriously threatened."
Committee member
Mark Wallace
Committee (LUPC) is considering a plan to
develop college-owned land across Crum
Creek in an area known as the Swarthmore
Farm Plateau. In addition to trees, the land
is the site of a leaf recycling center, a faculty house and one of the arboretum's
nurseries.

Before any decision is made, though,
the Crum Woods Stewardship Committee
will report on the possible negative effects
of development on the area's ecology. But
even if environmental considerations pre-

vent the creation of new fields in the Crum,
a change in the structure of the athletic
fields must be made, Associate Director of

Athletics Adam Hertz said.
"There are a lot of demands for the
fields, and we just don't have the supply
right now," he said. Because they are so
few in number, they have been worn out by
constant use. "The fields never have a
chance to rest and regrow," Hertz said.
He added that the plateau area is the
best option for new fields, especially since
much of it has already been paved over.
Administrators reacted openly to an athletic department proposal for baseball, softball and all-purpose fields on the plateau,

according to Hertz.
"They understand the necessity to grow,
and they understand our options are limited," he said. The plateau is actually closer
to the field house than Cunningham Fields
and would be convenient for the athletes.
The LUPC agrees that expansion of the
athletic fields is necessary. They examined

different sites but concluded in their
available
at
landuse.swarthmore.edu, that the plateau
was "the most appropriate area for this

report,

expansion."

Committee member and religion professor Mark Wallace disagrees with the majority. His dissent, noted in the report, contends that building fields will destroy the
area's environmental quality.

Council prepares to vote on activist forum proposal
SC to abandon SEPTA proposal after research demonstrates unlikelihood of student discount
BY REIKO TESHIBA
rteshibl@swarthmore.edu
Because of upcoming spring budgeting, the most pressing issue at hand for Student Council is a proposal from
Jeff Regier 'O3 for the Forum for Activism (FFA).
According to Regier, many activist groups are currently
reviewing the FFA charter. On Monday night, the
Swarthmore Progressive Action Committee (SPAC) tenta-

tively agreed to take part in the FFA.
Regier envisions the FFA starting off as a budgeting
organization for activist groups. As the forum gains legitimacy in representing the campus's wide scope of interests
and needs, it could develop into an umbrella organization
for activist groups. Regier sees the potential for the FFA to
encourage cooperation among
groups by publishing a newsletter
and maintaining a Web site as well
as helping groups stay active even
after their key members graduate.
"Activist groups tend to have a
tenuous relationship with SBC,"
Regier said. "Because the FFA

would be a Student Council committee, it will have much of the stability of Student Council." He also
said that with time, the FFA could
establish itself as a "reliable investment" for SBC.
"There's definitely a bit of nervousness that some
activist groups would end up having less flexibility with
their money than in the past," SPAC member Sarah
Drescher 'O3 said. She hopes the FFA could address the fact
that activist groups have not been as well funded by SBC
as other student groups in the past.
"This is a new kind of approach, so I'm cautiously optimistic," Drescher said.
Nate Wessler 'O4, an active member of Conscious
Consumers, attended the council meeting to voice his concerns. "I feel that the process is rolling ahead at breakneck
speed without our knowing the implications," he said.
"There needs to be more communication." Conscious
Consumers was not included in Regier's initial

proposal.

"As students, it's hard to bargain with SEPTA." CoPresident Liane Rice 'O3 said. "We're trying a faster, more

a van service into Center City. It is also investigating liability issues to see whether professional or student drivers
could run the van.
Rice said that, if they could prove that many students
support low-cost transportation to Philadelphia, they
would have a better chance convincing SEPTA for student

With the spring housing lottery rapidly approaching, the
has submitted its proposals for revising
certain policies for the upcoming fall semester. Included in
this proposal is a recommendation to increase the number
of rooms available for coed housing on campus.
Coed housing currently exists in the Lodges and in
Worth I and J. Committee members and the Queer Straight
Alliance (QSA) members who proposed coed housing, however, do not believe that this limited space is adequate to
serve all those who want coed housing. The new plan calls
for the addition of approximately seven one-room doubles
open for those who desire coed housing.
"We were concerned about meeting the needs of rising
sophomores," Dean of Residential Life Myrt Westphal said.
"We did not meet the needs of the class of 2004 in terms of
coed housing demands."
Committee members believe the new proposal better
addresses the original idea behind coed housing. "I think
the campus is really receptive to the idea of opposite-gender
housing pairs," committee member Renee WillemsenGoode 'O3 said. "The proposal brought by Tim StewartWinter 'Ol of the QSA last year was not really fulfilled by

In the end, the committee rejected this proposal. "You

Westphal said. "So why should we start with this?"
Gotcsik realized that the application proposal itself
would not be adequate. However, she hopes that coed housing requests are honored during the lottery process in the
tnd of April. "I hope people are respectful of those who are
interested in coed housing and allow those spaces to be used

The committee decided on the basement of Mary Lyon as
an ideal location for coed housing. The committee believes
that turning these seven one-room doubles, termed "undesirables," into coed housing will increase their appeal in the
spring housing lottery. "Since these rooms are the last to go,
our new plans would provide everyone with a chance to
gain coed housing," Westphal said.
But there is also a distinct possibility the college will
renovate ML basement over the summer. These rooms
wpuld then become smaller singles instead of the current
doubles.
To avoid any problems that would arise, the committee
also proposed a backup plan. The two-room quad and five
one-room doubles in Palmer would be under consideration
for coed housing if the plans for ML were changed due to
construction work. Decisions on construction will be made
over the next few weeks.
"We considered Woolman and Roberts as well,"
Westphal said. "But, in the end, we decided that Palmer
offered us more flexibility. With the other two halls, we
would run out of space before we ran out of demand."
The committee also addressed a proposal, presented by
Marah Gotcsik 02, who was representing what she called "a
different voice." Gotcsik explained that some students
interested in coed housing had suggested a proposal system.
"My main concern with coed housing is that the people
who need the coed housing won't get it," said Gotcsik.

Workshops to focus on neglected student health issues
BY BENJAMIN KABAK
bkabakl@swarthmore.edu
With students engrossed in the academic
rigors of the semester, many members of the
college administration are growing increasingly concerned with a perceived decline in
the status of students' personal health. In
order to bring health awareness to campus,

Richard Vezina '99, men's health consultant
to Worth Health Center, is in the process of

In the end, Vezina explained that

Tuesday's meeting was intended to establish
what Swarthmore students think it means to
be healthy and how students on campus are
not necessarily achieving these health goals.
Throughout the discussion the group
focused on six different topics. The first section focused on the problem of alcohol on
campus. The group mentioned the negative

He went on to explain what he viewed as
the main problems on campus. "Things are

The areas of concern, according to

The group then went on to cover the
issue of sleep. The opinion of the group was
that students at Swarthmore do not view
sleep as a top priority in their already
packed schedules. According to those at the
meeting, some students will go to extremes
to enhance their abilities to stay up later.

After many delays and problems,
'Shakespeare' play cancelled
After choosing a cast and rehearsing
for much of last semester, the student
production of "The Complete Works of
William Shakespeare (Abridged)" will
not be performed due to complications
with licensing.

"There was a misunderstanding
between [the] licensing company and
myself," director Kathy Liu 'O4 said.
After casting and rehearsing the show,
her production ground to a halt when a
professional presentation of "The Complete Works" went up in Philadelphia.
Proximity rules dictated that another
production could not be performed of
the same play nearby.
"Eventually, it got sorted out, but we
were already four weeks behind schedule," Liu said.
When Liu, stage manager LiErin
Probasco 'O4 and the three-person
cast decided to push the show forward
to the spring, they lost an actor, Greg
Goldman 'O3, who had decided to take
the semester off. Soon, Probasco realized she could not commit to the performance during the spring semester,
and, by the time Liu found a new stage
manager, the actor she had chosen to
replace Goldman had quit "because of
the lags."
Jon Stancato 'O2, a member of
Drama Board, said that because of

understand that."
"None of us are particularly happy

about it," Liu said, but the obstacles to
putting the show on were too much.
Licensing troubles have affected productions in the past, as well. "What we
have been told in Drama Board is that,
when A Chorus Line' was done here
the company not only pulled the rights,
but also tried some more intense legal
action because the cast went against
the original racial types," Stancato said.
"The college defended the production,
but the rights were still revoked."
"The Complete Works" was written
by Adam Long, Daniel Singer and Jess
Winfield, with additional material by
Reed Martin, according to the Web site
of Albemarle of London. It has been
performed by the American and

Put PDCs to rest
About halfway through the spring semester of 2001, most of the
members of the Spanish 4B class looked at their professor in disbelief. She had just told them that their class was not a PDC. They
protested, utterly confused, cursing. There was a significant writing
requirement, especially for a language class, and they had three discussion sessions each week. The students incredulously wondered,
how could it not be a PDC?
Confusion over which classes are designated as PDCs should surprise no one. Although the registrar posts a list of them each semester, they often vary greatly in size, substance and requirements
the exact three elements that were supposed to be most important.
Some PDCs have 20 or more pages of written work, whereas others

PDCs often vary greatly in size, substance and
requirements the exact three elements that
were supposed to be most important.
have closer to five. Some PDCs are discussion-based, while others
are taught entirely as lectures. There are even PDCs with more than
100 students, such as this semester's biology 2: organismal and population biology. It gets passed off as a PDC because lab sections are
supposed to be under 25 people.
With all this variation, the meaning of those three letters has disappeared. No one knows what a PDC really is, and decisions about
which are designated as such vary greatly by department.
Distribution requirements are important and ought to remain,
but PDCs accomplish nothing and should be eliminated.
The idea of making all students take a first-year seminar is a
good one. These seminars can do what PDCs originally should have:
teach students how to write and allow for discussion-based learning.
They do, however, pose some problems. Certain departments
already have difficulty providing enough classes, and the college
must not cut the number of upper-level courses in order to create
enough new first-year seminars.
Another potential problem is that students would end up in a
class based on their responses to a questionnaire. Although roommate pairs come together based on questionnaires, the notion of
choosing classes this way may be seriously faulted. These seminars
will be intense experiences and could prove disastrous if the students are not interested in the material. The majority of entering
students don't have a good sense of what they want to major in.
It is clear that changing the first-year curriculum is has been
necessary for quite a while, but PDCs should be eliminated, not limited, and the proposed first-year seminars must be evaluated more
seriously.

Aid for everyone
It was indeed a busy meeting for the Board of Managers last
weekend. Among the more routine decisions about tenure and
tuition, the board faced a more unusual decision: whether the college would replace the financial aid the federal government denies
to students with drug convictions. The issue is being debated in at
least a few colleges around the country, and Student Council has
been pushing for the decision since the beginning of the semester.
The board decided that it would indeed make up this aid. It was
undoubtedly the right choice
anyone who has been admitted to
Swarthmore should be afforded the financial opportunity to come
here. If we trust the admissions office to admit only those who
should be here at Swat and after all, "no one is an admissions
mistake"
then a student who might have experimented with marijuana should get the same aid package as his record-less
counterpart.

Another important part of this story is practically being swept
under the rug. The decision prompted college officials to think

about the importance of looking at criminal convictions in the
admissions process. The new application will now include a question about criminal convictions, though the exact wording is yet to
be chosen. According to Jim Bock '9O, dean of admissions and financial aid, the information yielded by knowing if a student has a criminal record "relates to character" and encourages "community-building." But does a question like this really serve its purpose?
While it's clear that Swarthmore tries to screen out students that
might, well, apply their intelligence to the forces of evil, even the
smallest incident might reflect poorly enough to keep out a potentially great future student, one that might have been accepted in
years past. The administration would be wise to think carefully
about whether to include this question and how to word it.

Monologues misunderstood

resonates throughout the monologues. A goal of the
monologues is to help women overcome this selfhatred through accepting their bodies as they are.
One means by which patriarchal society objectifies women is through the pejorative use of wordslike
'"pussy" and "cunt" to make the vagina an insult and
to represent it as a purely sexual organ designed to
please men. The monologues reclaims these words by
attempting to give them posi-

The monologues' purpose

is to reclaim the vagina and to

more importantly, by making

A large part of the monologues' intent is to
increase dialogue about these too often ignored
issues. Joanne Lipton's effort and decision to write a
letter was gratifying to me, but it is unfortunate that
the chalkings were misunderstood as purely sexual. I
hope she and others can appreciate that, although
there are many problems with the script, one of them
is not the objectification of women. "The Vagina

women.

months later, and I am thus far undefeated against one of my fellow baseball co-captains. And it eats at him, I can tell. He complains to his girlfriend about how he can't beat me, makes excuses, and tosses and turns at night. Enter my next victim, head
baseball coach Frank Agovino. Admittedly, he beat me 4-6 in just
the third full set we played. My lackluster performance was
unacceptable so I issued another guarantee: Coach Frank would
never beat me again. Since then, I have kept my word as Coach
Frank has become increasingly frustrated with his own play,
constantly muttering to himself on the other side of the net.
My tennis domination has dwindled of late. I have not lost,
but Scott did once take me to tie breaker. This is such a great run
and I have enjoyed every minute. In fact, my delight has gotten
so outlandish in the past few weeks that I challenged both Scott
and Coach Frank to a game of one on two. They balked, unwilling to part with the last of their pride. I'll probably lose one day.
But my domination, especially over Scott, has gotten to a point
that even if we trade wins for the rest of the year, I will have won.
Such an asinine guarantee should have lasted a week or two, not
a quarter of a year. I'll lose, yes, most likely, maybe even before
this article goes to print. But thanks to the tennis coach or Mulan
from Disney or some generous alum, I have the chance to play a
little tennis and have a lot of fun. Which is nice.

The new 'quick fix' for poverty
Pouring funds into marital promotion won't solve problem
BY MAYA

SCHENWAR

Don't have the $1.50 for a couple of loads at the
Laundromat? Don't have the funds for macaroni and
cheese, let alone college for the kids? Here's a fix—get married, and quick.
So says the Bush administration's latest piece of
welfare legislation a proposal to spend $lOO million
a year on marriage promotion. Yes, that's right.
According to a Feb. 19 article in The New York
Times, the same people who want to get the government out of the private sector are advocating an allout effort to "reduce out-of-wedlock births" and
"encourage the formation of two-parent families."
The best part is that the welfare department is at the
forefront of this super-wedlock plan, with welfare
chief Wade F. Horn as its main champion. So the millions of dollars that go into coercing low-income people to marry will be taken out of the fund that actually gives them direct financial support. But, assuming we overlook the multitude of more effective ways

to combat poverty, the marry-'em-off proposal is still
a straight-up bad idea. Its logic is as faulty as the
change machine in the Willets laundry room. Let's
look at why.
The New York Times article cites a striking stat:
"children growing up in one-parent families are four
times as likely to be poor as those growing up in twoparent households." Take this statement at face
value, and a quick-fix marriage for all seems like a
great idea. However, the politicians using facts like
these to advance their plan are dealing with a major

case of correlation/causation confusion. Children

growing up in one-parent families aren't poor
because they're in one-parent families
they're
poor because they're in poor families. Poverty is
caused by many, many factors, least of all the marital
status of those it afflicts. Pinning the blame on the
"broken family" is an obvious cop-out. Besides,
unless the welfare department is advocating some
kind of forced cross-class marriage initiative,
chances are that most of the new marriages created
would be between low-income people, who would still
have low incomes even after tying the knot.
This is, of course, assuming that the knot stays
tied and that it doesn't cut off anyone's circulation.
Dr. Horn is quoted in the Times as saying, "The
empirical literature is quite clear that, on average,
kids who grow up in stable, healthy, married, twoparent households do better than kids who grow up
bring out
in some other kind of arrangement." OK

letter

to

the ten-tiered cake. But let's pause for a reality
check. More marriages definitely don't mean more
"stable, healthy" marriages. How is the government
going to guarantee marital happiness for all its federally funded ring recipients? Keep in mind that the
U.S. divorce rate is over 50 percent (and that goes for
people ofall income levels). Who says that more marriages won't just equal more divorces? Horn advocates classes in marital skills for the newlyweds
because people with more money need to teach people with less money how to run every aspect of their
lives
but this hardly seems a foolproof plan.
Another fun statistic from The New York Times:
An analyst from the Heritage Foundation points to
the rise in the percentage of children born to unmarried women, from five percent in 1960 to 33.2 percent
in 2000. "This is something that's really happened in
the last 40 years," he says. "It's not socially
inevitable, and it can be reversed." Hmmm. But
should it be? Yes, fewer women are getting married.
Does this necessarily mean that there are more
starving babies? More unhappy women? Maybe it
means that more women are realizing they need not
get married to people they do not want to marry simply because they're pregnant. Maybe it means that
women in abusive relationships are getting out

before their children, too, have to take the violence.
Maybe it means that single women who are not
involved in a serious relationship but still want to

raise children can do so.

Perhaps most disturbingly, for all the government
advocacy of upping the marriage quotient, everyone
is conveniently forgetting about all the people for
whom marriage isn't allowed. Maybe Horn's
"healthy, married, two-parent household" model is
not supposed to apply to same-sex parents. If marriage is the government's new quick-solve for financial problems, it seems that lower-income people who
don't fit the government's prescription for sexual orientation will just have to stay poor. Also, there are
plenty of straight couples who choose not to marry
for personal, social or political reasons. If the welfare
department uses economic pressure to promote its
marriage goals, it is automatically excluding whole
groups of lower-income people.
To top it off, in last Thursday's New York Times,
another marital promotion-related article appeared.
The headline read, "Two parents not always best for
children, study finds." Hmmm. Seems like good oldfashioned welfare may be a better route to economic
stability after

the

Activist groups should support FFA
Dear Editor:
The idea of Jeff Regier 'O3,
Student Council's Student Groups
Adviser, to create the Forum for
Activism (FFA) is a solid one, and
it deserves support from activist
groups. While there have certainly been some problems in the
process of having the forum developed and publicized, I'd like highlight its potential benefits so that
groups may keep them in mind as

they determine whether to come
under its umbrella.

One of the central missions of
the FFA is to simplify the funding
activist
process for campus
groups by placing individual
group funding under its direct
jurisdiction rather than the jurisdiction of the Student Budget

Committee. This move would
allow for more flexibility in funding for groups that frequently

require such flexibility: It is often
February 28, 2002

difficult for groups whose missions are frequently linked to an
ever-shifting political climate to
determine in advance what types
of projects they will undertake
and what types of resources will
be necessary.
Another aspect of the FFA that
I believe has strong positive
potential is its goal of improving
communication among activist
groups. In Regier's current charter proposal, he advocates creating a weekly activism newsletter,

a bulletin board in Parrish and a

Web site for the FFA. These three
ideas would aid campus activists
in creating awareness about their
issues and informing others about
what their groups are currently
working on. It would also help garner broad, immediate backing for
their causes when necessary.
Lastly, the FFA aims to help
new activist groups get started

and help sustain currently existing groups. With the person-power
and knowledge base of activists in
the FFA, it would be much easier
for people with passion to form
new groups to tackle issues of
importance to them. Moreover,
the FFA would support existing
groups, when necessary, by ensuring their representation at activity fairs, creating websites and bulletin boards for them, and publi-

cizing organizing meetings.
The possibilities for the FFA

are great. Activists here have
tried to create an umbrella group
several times, most recently in the
fall of 2000, with little success.
Bringing campus activists together in a meaningful way would be
extremely valuable, and I hope
that groups will consider that
value when they decide whether
to support the FFA.

In defense of the compensation commitee
Dear Editor:

On behalf of the Staff Compensation Review
Committee (CRC), chartered last spring to review the
College's staff compensation system, I am writing to
address some misconceptions raised by Dann
Naseemullah's column last week ("Staff wage issue not
going away," p. 11).

Like the Swarthmore Living Wage and Democracy
Campaign, the committee strongly supports the belief
that compensation from full-time employment at

how to allocate the additional funds. One of the

most costly CRC recommendations is restructuring the current
benefit system, which currently privileges individuals
and exacts a huge and disproportional toll on lower wage
earners with families.
We do not support the creation of wage structures
based on family need. This practice discounts equal pay
for equal work in favor of a system that was discarded by
law two decades ago after a long struggle by feminist and
minority workers, those most often victimized by this
practice.

We do not support the creation of
wage structures based on family
need. This practice discounts equal
pay for equal work.
Swarthmore College should not require supplementation
from other sources to meet basic living requirements of
individuals or families. We disagree with the Living Wage
and Democracy Campaign on how this can be achieved.
The package of recommendations by the CRC supports
the opportunity for individuals to receive more of their
incomes in their paychecks and to decide for themselves

The CRC is by no means a "closed-shop administration
deal." There seems to be an assumption that secret deals
are being made because of the committee's confidentiality agreement. This agreement grew out of our need to
meet in an atmosphere in which we can discuss and openly debate highly sensitive issues of compensation.
Open debate in an atmosphere of trust among a highly
diverse group of committee members has enabled the
CRC to thoroughly examine complex and controversial
issues, and to build consensus on a set of recommendations that is generally supported by the college community

The CRC has been open about what we discuss, and
open about what we recommend. We solicited information and feedback from advisory groups of students, staff,
faculty and the president's office. We surveyed the cam-

pus. And we incorporated the information and feedback
consistent with the stated values of the institution, and
the concerns of the staff the majority stakeholders

into our recommendations.
Nonetheless, members of the CRC have been subject to
mean-spirited, personal, and sometimes anonymous
attacks. There seems to be an assumption on the part of
some folks that we have an interest in working to harm
our colleagues, who are often also friends and neighbors,
and with whom we share a deep interdependence in order
to do our jobs effectively. What possible gain could we
have in creating an unfair system using unfair means?
And why would anyone believe that any member of the
CRC would want to, or agree to work in any way that is
not "inclusive and ethical"?
Perhaps most distressing is the failure of the critics of
the CRC to recognize real allies in working for a just and
ethical work place. There seems to be a belief that we
have been co-opted to be against the goal of livable compensation, and that, if we don't exactly agree on methods
to reach that goal, we are adversaries. It's difficult to promote dialogue when one of the participants stakes a claim
to the moral high ground and right answers. This is a
rather naive and short-sighted approach to social change
at any level.

Matthew Fitting Phoenix Staff

Students discuss cultural exchange between American Indians and European explorers Wednesday in professor Robert DuPlessis' first-year history seminar "The
Atlantic World." The history department offers more first-year seminars than any other department and strongly encourages potential majors to take one.
A plan to increase the number of freshman seminars and make them mandatory while reducing the number of required Primary Distribution Courses (PDCs)
could be in place by fall 2003.
Under the proposal, each first-year would take one of about 35 first-year semi-

nars from those departments that offer them during the fall semester. Enrollment
for seminars would be capped at 12, and the seminar professor could double as that
student's academic adviser.
The new plan was created by a four-professor committee concerned that the
freshman experience does not live up to what the college advertises to prospective
students, since many introductory classes are larger and more impersonal than the
typical Swarthmore class. Freshman seminars would change that, since the
emphasis would be on close student interaction with the professor.
Students would be assigned to seminars based on their academic interests and
information provided on forms filled out during the summer before freshman year.
Right now these forms determine who will serve as a student's academic adviser
for his or her first two years at Swarthmore.
As a side effect of the proposal, the number of required PDCs would be
reduced. Professors would switch from teaching PDCs so that the college would
be able to offer a sufficient number of freshman seminars. Distribution
requirements, however, would remain unchanged under the new plan.

Now, they have no clear

"Were we to get [freshman seminars], the only way we could pay for them
would be to reduce the PDC requirement," said English professor and committee
member Philip Weinstein.. The other three members are Barry Schwartz from the
psychology department, Kathleen Siwicki from biology and Joy Charlton from
sociology and anthropology. Charlton is also associate dean for academic affairs.
"It's not as though we started with the idea of reducing the PDC requirement,"
Weinstein said. But "people come here to do seminar-style classes, to have an
intensive experience with their professors," which they often don't get in PDCs.

'The antithesis of eating your oatmeal'
As opposed to the small classes and close contact with professors that the college's low eight-to-one student-to-faculty ratio implies, many students during their
first year take larger, less discussion-oriented introductory classes. In these classes, there is more lecture, less discussion, and little one-on-one contact between students and professors.
Aurora Camacho de Schmidt, a Spanish professor in the modern languages and
literature department, said these classes are the chief concern of those who favor
the new seminar plan.
"Students who are having academic problems [first semester] are in classes
where there is very little contact with the professors," she said. "When people

Professor Richard Eldridge, chair of the philosophy department,
said an all student-run seminar, that might succeed in an English
course would be impossible in introductory philosophy.
"There has to be, for effective introductory teaching, some systematic teaching of the material," he said. "This seems to require
some lecturing at least." Eldridge conceded that his resistance to
seminars also stems from his department's happiness with the PDC
system, which he said was almost "made for intro to philosophy
courses." He did acknowledge, though, the concerns of others.
"Like everybody else, I'm terrified of big education factories
where students are lectured from this television screen in lecture
halls of 400," he said. "But I don't see any danger of that at all."
Paley agreed that an all student-run seminar would be impossible in his department.
"Undoubtedly, the professor would be giving presentations," he
said. "In my senior seminars, it's sometimes easier for me to go to
the board and say, 'Look, it's just easier if I show you what I mean.'
But the idea is to keep that minimal."
And Weinstein said a seminar with all student-led discussion was
never what those who proposed the new plan had in mind.
Professors must regulate discussion and have imput to some extent,
he said, and the label "student-run" is misleading.
"I never thought of seminars as all student-run," he said. "When
they're good, seminars are student-active, not student-run." He also
said that different definitions for seminars in different departments
are perfectly acceptable. "If it's launched by all three divisions, it's
got to make sense to all three divisions," he said. Differences are
acceptable, he added, but anything taught in a lecture can also be
grasped in a seminar.

"Frankly, I just don't buy that passive learning is the best way to
learn whatever's being taught," he said. "Just as a pedagogical principle, I find that unconvincing."
Other complaints vary; some fear seminars that would be too
simplistic. "If anybody demanded a first-year seminar that was
babied down, a senior seminar but dumber," Burke said, "that would

not be acceptable."

Others are worried that faculty workload would increase despite
the drop in the PDC requirement.
"The possibility of more work is very difficult to contemplate" to
most faculty members, Camacho de Schmidt said. "People are
already strapped in terms of time."
Looking ahead

Amid the concerns and excitement surrounding freshman seminars, Weinstein emphasized, "These are early days on this," he said.
"Right now we're only floating it."
But Camacho de Schmidt described the idea as "moving pretty
fast." The consensus now, she said, is that PDCs are facing serious
problems and that a general dissatisfaction regarding the first-year
experience is pervasive.
"If we have a lot of first-year students who feel a little lost at the
end of the first semester, we need to do something," she said.
Burke said the widely acclaimed seminar experience offered to
juniors and seniors should be available to freshmen too. "You should
be having that liberal arts experience from the get-go," he said. "It
should be everything you didn't get in high school."
No official timetable has been set, and the faculty has had just two
informal lunch meetings on the issue. Proponents hope the proposal
will move quickly, with implementation possible by fall 2003.

The Phoenix takes on up-and-coming musician John Vanderslice in an exclusive interview
BY DREW ADAMS
dadamsl@swarthmore.edu

With three solo albums to his credit, along with three albums by his former band MK
Ultra, John Vanderslice is hardly new to the indie scene. And, at least among musicians,
he's a pretty popular guy: bands from all over have recorded in his San Francisco studio,
and several more have had John sing or play on theirrecords. His own records had only
received limited distribution until he went solo, but last year's "Time Travel is Lonely,"
with its combination of pop song structures, analog synth noises, and crazy lyrics,
expanded his fan base outside the Bay
Area considerably. Now, his forthcoming album is poised to make him a
at least among hobhousehold name

him and his band, along with Kind of

Seattle's paradox that we played and

told Josh to sign them right away. I also
schemed that fateful night to get Ben
out on tour with me, so there you have
a joint JV/KOLS tour. Seeing Mountain
Goats at Bottom of the Hill last year
was spectacular. I can't think of a better lyricist working in any genre.

DA: Speaking of the Mountain Goats,
John Darnielle has written lyrics for a couple songs on your new album and also recorded his songs in your studio. How did you two get together?
JV: We played a show together in 1999. A couple of months later I sent him "Time Travel,"
and he left a really long message on my answering machine. Now this ranks in my top ten
moments, as I am a fanatic Darnielle fan. I should've kept that message!

DA: Has his simplistic sort of approach (both to songwriting and recording) affected the
way you make music?

JV: Oh, yes. I mean, if you have the goods, you don't need to gussy them up with a bunch
of sonic tricks. I mean, look at Dylan's strongest work. I swear, I never get tired of his
early acoustic stuff, and I've heard it about 10,000 times. Darnielle's got the goods, and his
simple approach works very well.

DA: Reading the track notes to TTIL on your Web site, though, it's all about compressors,
ampex distortion, eight Moog tracks, four acoustic tracks, etc., etc.
is that level of production necessary to keep music new or interesting 50 years after the advent of the pop
song, or is it just a personal style thing?
JV: It seems to me the next challenge is to make a good record that strips all of this away.
There are sessions we do where it seems that juxtaposition of totally manipulated, synthetic sounds with organic tracks (ARP synths behind acoustic picking patterns, say) is
noble and worthy of pursuit. Other times it seems like I am obscuring the content of the
songs. Which, sometimes, can be a beautiful thing. But there's also a time to do something totally new and if stripping down a song to its essential elements is new for me,
then it might be an easy transition yeah, right.

DA: Your last album had three songs whose lyrics were slightly altered poems
William Blake, one by Robert Lowell. Why did you decide to use those? Do you find it
tough to find lyrics that really match the music you write?
JV: I have sifted through dozens of poetry books and tons of compilations looking for one
that'll work. The toughest thing is getting someone who writes in meter and whose language is modern and fresh. That's why Blake is such a miracle. I've thought many times
about doing a whole record of songs of innocence and experience.
DA: Along the same lines, you also borrow from Bach and Brahms on your interlude
tracks. Is it hard to incorporate classical music into indie pop?
JV: I've always wanted to use both of those pieces, and, yes, it is hard to work with them.
They are both so harmonically complicated, and the feel is so different from pop, where a
4/4 backbeat is more or less a clock that provides rhythmic stability. You won't find that
in classical very often. The kind of push/pull that happens in Mahler would drive a rock
and roller to drink!
DA: Did you write the letters in the liner notes to TTIL? They're signed by your brother
Jesse, although it seems obvious that Jesse's a fictional character.
JV: Yes, I did write those letters. My real brother, Ray, was way too busy. He is, by the
way, not nearly as crazy as Jesse.

m

DA: So much of songwriting is blatantly confessional. Is it hard for you to get away from
yourself and the people around you in favor of whaling ships and antidepressant abuse?
JV: Well, the autobiographical pool is pretty small, and after a few records a songwriter
starts looking around. A novelist routinely writes from different perspectives, so why not
use those devices in pop writing? DC Berman [of Silver Jews] and Darnielle have made
masterpieces out of third person narratives. But these things aren't clear-cut. Sometimes,
a song that seems to be about Moby Dick ("You Were My Fiji") is really about your band
breaking up (MK Ultra)!
DA: Finally, any commentary on the new album?
JV: It's a loose story about a volatile and prolific home recordist who goes West, gets into
a bit of trouble, and comes back beaten, reuniting with his girl and family. Impaired by
romantic ideals, he goes night-swimming in the Atlantic on summer vacation. It's called
"Life and Death of an American Fourtracker," and Barsuk will put it out on May 7, 2002.

Time Travel Is Lonely' a loose concept album

JOHN VANDERSLICE
Time Travel Is Lonely
Barsuk, 2001

"I am not going to say it's cold
here and won't tell you about the
vast, infinite emptiness that
draws every sad, lonely feeling
out of your breathless soul and
drops it on the bluish snow, right
at your polypropylene boots."
Soon, Jesse Vanderslice, like the
whaling ship captain on the
album cover, is stuck in
Antarctica. He has divorced his

wife, lost his job, pissed off his
parents and signed a contract
with
the National Science
Foundation to monitor satellites
from a polar research station. His sanity only lasts through
track eight. This, friends, is a concept album.
But it's a loose concept album, one organized around the
fictional Jesse's melancholy and increasingly insane letters
to his brother John that form the album's liner notes. He
writes wistfully of his childhood, sadly of his divorce and
his pre-departure fight with his parents, and with agitation

hull, demanding to be let out.
Obviously, though, no amount of tragic or pseudo-literary liner notes can make an album full of bad songs worth
your ten bucks. But here the songs pull their weight, ranging from Neutral Milk Hotel-style fuzz-pop to more straightforward rock reminiscent of Spoon to sparse acoustic guitar
or piano pop. As you might expect from a guy whose day job
is running an analog recording studio, every song is fully
fleshed out with multiple tracks of harmony vocals, distorted Moog, guitar and mellotron. The title track even has a
sample of a recharging camera flash in the chorus. In short,
John Vanderslice would throw the kitchen sink into the
mix if it made his songs more interesting; in this increasingly tired world of pop songwriting, that flair for detail can
only be a virtue.
It's the interplay between the story line and the music
that makes the album, though. Although the songs don't fol-

low Jesse's letters closely, they do echo his isolation and his
childhood reminiscences, they and slide into madness to an
uncanny degree. "Keep the Dream Alive," for example,
mixes a singsong vocal melody with lyrics about a boy lost
in the woods. "If I Live or If I Die" features three of the bounciest piano chords ever, cheesy handclaps, and eerie lyrics
borrowed from William Blake's "The Fly," one of two songs
from Blake's "Songs of Innocence": "Am I not a fly like you?
Are you not a man like me?" Likewise, "Emma Pearl" finds
Jesse pondering a girl who, either in his mind or in reality,
visits and tells him to smash the satellites he monitors: "But
if she doesn't exist, why do I miss her?" And amidst the
vaguely hopeful last track is buried one final macabre
image: the Russian submariners again beating on the hull
of the Kursk.
In the end, as with most independent music, this isn't for
everyone. His affected vocal accent might be a turnoff, the
lyrics get a bit bizarre, and the 10-to-mid-fi sound quality
isn't exactly radio-ready. But if you're a fan of The Who's
"Quadrophenia," William Blake, or simply hyperanalyzing
the hell out of music, this is the ticket.

Attention span waning? Check out these brief flicks
As spring break approaches, ease your agitated mind with film shorts at this weekend's festivals
BY MORGHAN HOLT

mholtl@swarthmore.edu

It's a week before break, and I, for one, am having trouble keeping my mind on my work, or, really, anywhere
remotely close to my work. At this point, class material is
less than captivating, and even the slightest excuse to
stray from the task at hand has me absolutely hooked. As
I type this, my mind has wandered from studying the intricate details of the silvery-stone wall in McCabe (where did
they find all those rocks?) to the intellectually stimulating
scrawlings on the desktop (what sort of anxiety disorder
compels its afflicted with the irrepressible urge to spend a
good half-hour carving the word "fuck" in lurid violet letters, where it will undoubtedly mar the minds of innocent
students for years to come?) to the irritating hangnail on
my left pinky that I've spent the day trying to ignore
maybe I should just give up and bite it off.
In short, I can't think. At least not consistently. I lack
the focus to really immerse myself in anything. I've spent
the last two weeks taking exams and tying up loose ends
(err
attempting to talk around late assignments) to prepare myself for break and the anxiety, the one-week
stretch, is killing me.
To distract myself from the spring break-induced tunnel-vision that keeps creeping up on me, I've taken to
involving myself in random, semi-entertaining, semi-useful endeavors. This morning, for instance, I organized my
thumbtack assortment according to color, shape and size.
Tomorrow, I think I'll attempt the same with my box full of
random rubber bands. Intermittently, I'll try to do some
work. But in very brief spurts. That's all my bombarded
brain can handle right now.

whiny complaints at bay. I improve plots in my head. I

imagine Aaliyah in her grave, unable to formally take
credit for her box-office-topping work, then wonder who's
accepting her cut of the revenue for "Queen of the
Damned." I try to mentally paint what the actors looked
like before their facelifts, and, before I know it, the credits
are rolling and I'm alone in the audience, staring at my
empty popcorn bag. Was the movie even good? I couldn't
tell ya. Forty minutes into it and it was as if I wasn't even

Tonight, The Black Maria Film and Video Festival

Chartand's "Black Soul," called "an immersion into the
heart of the Black experience," and also "exhilarating";
and Justin Schwarz's "Me and the Moilsies," which is

apparently extremely funny.
Total running time: 90 minutes. That puts the three
pieces at about 30 minutes each. They are varied enough in
their content and their presentation that I think that, even
in my state of distraction, I'll probably manage to focus. If
you, like me, are struggling to keep your head in one place,
head to the Prince Music Theater on Chestnut Street at
Broad, on the Avenue of the Arts, with your $lO entrance
fee, and feast your eyes on and occupy your brain with the
array of interesting, well-distributed, quickly changing

shorts.
For those of you with slightly more enduring attention
spans, follow up the event at the 15th annual Philadelphia
Weekend Film Festival, where director/producer Ismail
Merchant of Merchant Ivory Productions will be honored
with a retrospective of his work. That includes "The
Golden Bowl," starring Nick Nolte, Anjelica Huston and
Uma Thurman, and his newest directorial endeavor, "The
Mystic Masseur." The festival itself takes place in the RitzCarlton this Saturday and Sunday. The experience is
described as being of "seminar quality" and runs a bit
pricey (and lengthy) for my current state ofaffairs. If interested, you can get information or make reservations by
calling (215) 569-9700.
Alternatively, opt to devote only your Saturday afternoon and attend the screening of "The Mystic Masseur"

Be proud, ye writers of 'Common Sense'

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY JOEY SPADOLA

jspadoll@swarthmore.edu
Tears have not ceased to flow from my
eyes since I first read, in awe, the latest

number of that sublime periodical which
goes under the humble but inadequate title
Common Sense. One can scarcely turn a
single page of this literary gem without
being struck by some splendid display of
eloquence and pathos. O Common Sense!
How I wept when I read thee! How I convulsed, how I writhed for very delight! Ye
Gods, I nearly perished in a transport of
ecstasy! I have spent the last few nights
sleepless, memorizing the lush, rolling
periods, the rich, poetic cadences, in which
every article, without exception, abounds,
so that I come to this column weary but
laden with inspiration.
For the benefit of the luckless who have
never heard of Common Sense or perused
its pages, it can be described briefly as an
"intercollegiate journal of humanism and
freethought" whose writers, armed with
golden quills, touch upon such manifold
subjects as religion, philosophy, science,
math, art, poetry, etc. But do not be led
astray by the title. Common Sense has
nothing of the merely common, nor of the
merely sensical. Rather, it is extraordinary
and sublime. It is lofty and brilliant. It is
glamorous and profound. Its object is nothing less ponderous than
as the editors
"to question what it
themselves have it
means to question everything."
Indeed, would anyone have me believe
that it is mere common sense which operAudrey Chan Phoenix Staff

Awed by such grandeur of expression,

we may well suppose that the writers of

far transcends our humble earthly station.
We may well suppose that these creatures
walk in company of the divine; that from
the clouds they wield their eloquence, as
Jove does his thunder; that, although they
have permitted us a momentary glimpse of

their puissance, we shall never be vouchsafed the opportunity of seeing them in
flesh and in bone.
All this, indeed, I myself supposed, not

without justification. But, in fact, it is not

so. And to the incredulous reader who,
understandably, withholds belief, I proclaim, with a mixture of consternation and
excitement, that there walks among us, on
this very campus, a distinguished member
of that divine group of scribblers to whom
Common Sense owes it sublimity.
I, personally, have never met the man;
and it is a fortunate thing, for I doubt I
could maintain consciousness in his

peerless writer. "I believe the dictionary

pride in.

This is not to say that Mum are not great; in
fact, for the type of electronic pleasantry they are
shooting for, they're nearly perfect. Like Sigur Ros,
Mum use lush, dramatic chords and emotive counterpoint to bring a confusedly emotional smile to
any listener's face. But whereas their elders combine these complex ambient textures with overserious (and heavenly) falsetto and increasingly

Political cynicism with a moral twist
Sherman Alexie reflects on topics that run the gamut from homophobia to 'God Bless America'
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
ldremeal@swarthmore.edu
I went to Sherman Alexie's presentation last Thursday
expecting to be offended. During his talk at Haverford last
year, he jumped into the realm of political incorrectness
right away when he told the shaggy-headed kid who had
presented him that he'd "never been introduced by Jesus

before." Alexie mocked the liberalness of the Haverford
crowd and made quite a few off-color jokes that poked fun
at sex, politicians, old people, white people and Indian people. And he continually addressed the crowd as "you white
folks," despite the fact that much of the audience wasn't
white.
I interviewed him before his Swarthmore presentation,
which was organized by the Native American student
group here and sponsored by the Cooper Foundation.
Having read in a transcript of an old interview that Alexie
thought of reservation youth as his "ideal audience," I
asked him to describe his target reader.
"I'm not going to be happy until every human being on
the planet has read something I've written," he said.
"Mostly, it's for me. If anyone else wants to join in, that's

apparently. And, he said, even to brown people like himself, after Sept. 11 "every brown person became every other
brown person."
When he boarded a plane shortly after the attacks, he
said, he actually wished there would be NRA members on
the plane. And after "another little brown guy" walked on,
he found himself wanting "18 crew-cut right-wing racist
xenophobic warrior-like bastards." He, a "liberal, leftie,
commie, Indian, Red, red, vegan, pagan
Birkenstockcourting, gray ponytail, NPR, Nation-subscribing,
Progressive-reading Indian, and I want warriors on the
plane with me!"
Yes, his stereotypes were kind of shocking, but they
were funny as hell, and apparently the whole audience
knew it. I guess it's the very nature of stereotypes that
makes people laugh at them: You know they're not true,
and the idea that they could be is hilarious.
So it was a little surprising when Sherman Alexie
moved out of his self-deprecating, generalizing, mildly
insulting mode to toss a reflective moral question at us.
Referring to wanting the kind of people he hated most to

fear?"

And Alexie, an enrolled member of the Spokane and
Coeur d'Alene tribes, is usually publicized and praised as
an Indian writer. Is that category confining? Is he proud of

And the same point came around as Alexie mocked the
notion that the "impromptu" recital of "God Bless
America" on Capitol Hill on the night of Sept. 11 was in any
way spontaneous.
"There are some very bad teleprompter readers in the
U.S. Senate," he said. But, as he invalidated the performance that had probably moved thousands of Americans to

it?

"It doesn't bother me, I'm not proud of it, it's just who I
am," he responded.
Having read online that he visited schools and taught
creative writing to Indian kids, I asked Alexie if he had
any thoughts on what it meant to teach writing.
"No," he answered. "I don't even know how to begin to
do that. I would just hand people books and say, 'Go read
this.'
During the bitterly funny presentation that followed, in
which Alexie collaborated with musician Jim Boyd in a
packed LPAC cinema, there was more of the same. Boyd, a
songwriter, guitarist and singer, started the presentation
with a mellow tune about powwows. He then played a tune
mocking the sorry state of the "land of the free" in which
we live. After performing a track from the soundtrack to
"Smoke Signals," a movie Sherman Alexie wrote, Boyd,
who is a member of the Lakes band on the Colville Indian
Reservation, led the audience in a surprisingly successful
sing-along.
Alexie walked onstage with the comment, "I bet that's
the first time Swarthmore's sung a 'wayahaya' song."
Then he launched in with the affront, "I don't know if
you white folks know this, but we brown folks profile you,
too." That's by keeping "one-hundred yards away from a
white person for every square inch of flag they're waving,"
"

tears, Alexie came around again with a lesson. The politi-

cians had sung to elicit a specific emotional response, and
they had succeeded
George W Bush has, at certain
times since September, held a 90 percent approval rating.
Why? Alexie answered his own question: "Because it's
easy to motivate behind fear and ignorance and hatred."
He moved on to a commentary on gays, whom he
deemed the victims of the only universally accepted hatred
in the world. "George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden have
the same exact views of homosexuals; why can't they get
together and talk?" he asked. Then he systematically went
through each argument ever given to justify homophobia
the Bible forbids it, it isn't natural, our bodies are not

made for it and disproved each one.
The closing portion of Alexie's presentation described
the horrendous childbirth his wife endured. In their home,
where they had opted to have only midwives present, she
sustained a 27-hour labor whose complications pushed
their son close to death. Alexie alluded to the baby's loss of
hearing, showing the audience some of the sign language
his son had made up.
The regret he and his wife felt knowing what tragedy

could have been prevented by giving birth in a hospital
was unimaginable, he said. Although they began filing a

lawsuit against those who had caused damage during the
delivery, they decided to "let it go." They didn't want to say
to their son that he was anything less than what they had
wanted. Anyway, he asked, "what is a lawsuit but
revenge?"
Alexie finished his lively talk with a depressing anecdote about questioning your own convictions. Oddly
enough, aU ofhis comments, though obviously intended to
offend, seemed to have ethical lessons woven into them.
Yes, his unmentionable detailing of why gay sex is "natural" made me squirm, and his assertion that his baby
would have been fine if there had just been "a man in the
room" (did he mean a doctor? I wasn't sure) made me
downright angry. But he'd said those things knowing they
would, so I didn't really care.

record has an almost nostalgic feel. This time around it's
more like I've-heard-this-all-before-and-it-still-sounds-

Of course, they do have a few new tricks to show off.
Like Daft Punk, they have taken note of more recent
trends in dance music, as is evident in the streamlined,

cuts here, for all its Darude-cribbing). If anything, "Come
With Us" is more varied sonically than any of their previFebruary 28, 2002

ous efforts, from the dark and tumultuous cellos that open
the album to the gentle Spanish-y guitar line suddenly

morphing into dark electro-funk (on the nifty "Hoops") to
what sounds like a demented music box tinkling away in
"My Elastic Eye." Even when things start to sound awfully hackneyed, there are enough ideas percolating in the
mix to keep them interesting.
The Brothers made some questionable decisions on this
one, like submerging a pretty little Beth Orton melody in
swaths of muddy knob-twiddling and burbles and allowing
the annoyingly earnest Richard Ashcroft vocal about acid
tests to mix with a recycled but workable funk loop, creating the danceable but rather inane

closer "The Test." And,

unavoidably, a handful of cuts in the album's second half
don't quite make the mark. But the Chemical Brothers
were never perfectionists. Their genius, it seems to me,
has always come from goofing around and coming up with
entertaining (and occasionally sublime) pieces of music.
And, in a way, they've never done that more successfully
than here. This album doesn't want for humor, versatility

or flavor. All it lacks is a bit of the freshness that made
them seem so revolutionary back in 1997.

discipline. Studying the arts is widely accepted; art history,
music theory and film studies classes abound and are popular
with students. But dance is the lonely step-sibling, relegated to
the outer edges of academia.
This weekend, however, the symposium "Dance in South
Asia: New Approaches, Politics, and Aesthetics" will take a step
to change that. Placing dance in the contexts of anthropology,
religion and history, the symposium will feature leading scholars in those fields as well as well-known practitioners of classical dances Odissi (from east India), Bharatanatyam (from south
India) and Kathak (from north India). The symposium will take
place in LPAC Cinema on Saturday, March 2, from 9:15 a.m. to

what a new question would reveal about students' characters and exactly what the question would ask.
Matt Rubin, Student Council co-president, said he
had "reservations" about asking admissions applicants
about their criminal records. The new question will
reveal information to admissions counselors that they
never had access to before, and a group of Student
Council members will meet with Bock next week to discuss the issue that will arise from this new information

amounts.

at length.
Although the decision represents a official stance
from the college about educational opportunity, the
amount of actual aid involved is expected to be small.
"The financial aid budget is likely adequate to meet
our needs," Eldridge said, although he noted that "we
have no experience to measure how much money might
be needed" to replace the federal aid of students with
drug convictions. Preliminary numbers from a worksheet written by Laura Talbot indicate that the total
amount of aid replaced could range up to $12,700. Bloom

"This year, our average aid award is $24,274," Talbot
said in an e-mail. "$5,354 is a combination of federal, state
and community scholarships/grants, federal and college
loan funds, and federal or college compensation for students' campus jobs."
When Swarthmore decided to replace aid that students had lost because they did not register for Selective
Service, there were "a handful of schools" who acted in
the same way, Talbot wrote. "Earlham, Haverford and a
few others replaced forfeited federal funds but only with
their own loan funds," she wrote. Many of the schools
that moved in this direction were historically Quaker
institutions.
There may be a few other schools that are replacing
aid the federal government denied students because of
drug convictions, according to Darrel Rogers, national
outreach coordinator of Students for a Sensible Drug

Policy.

Some schools, including Yale, are debating whether to

replace this aid, but neither Bloom, Bock nor Eldridge
could confirm that any other schools had already decided
to replace this federal aid. Bock suggested Swarthmore
may have addressed the issue early, but a number of colleges will have to deal with it this spring. Eldridge wrote
that other schools "with need-blind admissions practices
will continue their practices."
"Students would have to fill in that gap on their own,"
Bruce Poch, vice president and dean of admissions for
Pomona, said of the policy Pomona would likely adopt it
if this issue were raised there. Each private college will
have the opportunity to make its own decisions about
replacing this aid.
"There is a bit of a difference between the public and
the private universities," Rogers said. While private colleges can sometimes replace federal aid, public colleges
may face a "backlash" if they try to replace aid denied by
the federal government.
"We saw no legal liability which would prevent the
college from continuing its policy" by replacing aid the
government denies because of drug convictions, Bloom
said.

The development office has a campaign budget of $lO million during the

This budget excludes normal development expenditures. Swarthmore spends
about 11 to 12 cents for every dollar

President for Alumni, Development and

town might want to use the park for its

Smedley Park," he said.
Finding a closer off-campus site is
unlikely since the area around the college
is highly developed. If the site were not
within walking distance, transportation
would have to be arranged for the athletes, which could create scheduling conflicts with afternoon classes and labs.
"There is a tremendous need for the
fields but not very many alternatives. The
Crum Woods are not a very attractive
alternative, but may be the best alternative," Everbach said.
Latham worries that any more construction in the Crum Woods would lead
to the local extinction of many native

species.

"This is certainly an interesting issue
for the college, because it involves making a complex decision among competing
interests," Schall said. "'Unless we decide

Earthworms best Penn Void in three tune-up games
BY PAUL

WULFSBERG

pwulfsbl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore Earthworms made the short drive to
Belmont Park in Philadelphia last weekend to battle arch
rival University of Pennsylvania Void. Observers predicted
a Void victory, since Penn had finished last spring tenth in
the nation and are still consistently around No. 15 in the
Ultimate College Reporter. Though the Earthworms had

only 17 players, they elected to divide into two teams to play
Void's total horde of nearly 40, giving Penn a chance to wear
Swat down. Both Swat teams would defy the odds and
emerge victorious, the A-team winning 11-3 and 13-9, while
the B squad staged an impressive comeback to triumph 15-12.
In the first match between the A teams, Swat met little
UPenn resistance and won 11-3. Behind the impressive han-

dling ofCharles Small 'O3, Brandon Silverman 'O2 and Daniel
Schwartz 'O2, the hammer-blocking mitt of Jeremy Slezak
'O2, and the authoritarian leadership of Michael Wollenberg
'O2, Swat went up from the first point and never looked back.
Overly confident in the rematch, the Worms barely led at
the half. In the game to 13, the Earthworms found themselves
up only 11-9 but ended the game before the crushed Penn
team could rally, scoring the penultimate point on a huck
from Patrick Gilman 'O2 to Paul Wulfsberg 'O3.
The day finished with a rare and dramaticplay. Swat was
leading 12-9 on Void's goal line with Andrew Rosskam 'O4
holding the disc. Misha Horowitz 'O3 cut in sharply, making

his man overcompensate, then headed for the back corner of
the end zone. Rosskam's flick was overthrown and floated
out the back. Undeterred, Horowitz launched himself almost
horizontally from inbounds to grab the disc and, from the air

space above out-of-bounds, passed to John Anderson 'O3 for
the game winner.
On the B team's field, a younger Worms group traded
points with the Void B, going into the half down 8-5. After the
break, Billy Schwarz 'O5 caught the Penn defense off-guard
with a quick thumber through the stack to a diving Aaron
Goldman 'O3 to score.
Penn continued to best the Worms until Colin Peng-Sue
'O3 sparked the Earthworms' comeback with a diving catch
and forehand break to George Petel 'O5 to narrow the gap to
three. After the pull to the Void, Al Bui 'O2 knocked down a
long Void pass. Thus further inspired, the Earthworms
worked the disc patiently up the field until captain Ben
Hamilton 'O3 hit an open Dima Shchelokov 'O2 in the back of
the end zone. The discouraged Void never recovered, dropping five of the next six points to lose to Swat B 15-12.

Advils & adrenaline: Swatties gear up for
another episode of basketball playoff fever
BY EMILY "PASS THE RICE CAKES"
GRAY AND CAITLIN "YOU GONNA EAT
THAT?" RYLAND
egrayl@swarthmore.edu and
crylandl@swarthmore.edu
So in case you have been living under a
rock since Saturday night, yes, we lost the
Conference Championship. Yes, we were
blown out by thirty points to the consistent
taunting of Western Maryland fans:
"Swarthmore can't score!" And it was true
we couldn't score. Well, lucky for you
die-hard ball watchers, our season isn't
over yet. We may have dropped the big one,
but now our sights are set on avenging the
loss by making a run in the ECAC tournament. The results of this continued
marathon of games: the sweats, dizziness,
shortness of breath. No, not a hangover or
the shady side effects of those trans-hypolean-leaky potato chips. Yet another tourney is upon us, folks. Breakouts of several
playoff-related illnesses are sweeping the
campus at an alarming rate. Here are a few
warning signs to look for:
L The über-fans among us may be experiencing a touch of the Ro-bonic Plague as
of late. This nasty malady manifests itself
mainly in the lower portion of the fan's
body. The Ro-bonic Plague is characterized
by a stiffness in the knee joints and sore
quadriceps muscles as the fan repeatedly
attempts to sit down and then thrusts him
or herself upwards in a jolt of appreciation
for some nasty shake 'n' bake a la Katie
Robinson 'O4
over and over and over
again. Several afflictions of late have
affected the men's basketball team, who
have shaken their traditional stoicism in
favor of more alert, and, yes, even active
...

fan behavior.

2. Worth Health Center has been fielding a great deal of complaints from students, faculty and staff describing symptoms of the dreaded Downtown-arrhea.
This unfortunate infirmity is characterized by a stiff neck and sore rotator cuffs
from watching Garnet Tideswomen drain
threes from all over the court and then
reminding the referees and opposing
stands with a flopping windmillesque
grace that they, too, can make goal posts
out of their arms.
3. Hippie-thermia is also no stranger to
the Swarthmore community. This illness

can be identified in students with excessive
sweating, creamy white body parts and a
total lack of any trace of inhibition. Last
year, come playoff season, the campus
recorded a record number of cases as fans

stripped off their Bohemian garb for a
more artistic approach to apparel. Perhaps
as some sort of some avant-garde performance or List Gallery installation, scantily
clad Swatties painted large red letters
across their chests and rearranged themselves around Tarble Pavilion to spell
things like SWARTHMORE, WARTS,
ARORT and RAW HOES on chilly
Wednesday and Saturday evenings. May

the tradition live on. Bone up on your vitamin C, you brave, brave souls, you.
4. Carbo-loaders no longer avoid the

mushy pasta at Sharpies. "Permapasta! I'm
pitching a tent by that cart!" A bailer may
be identified by the variety of entrees and
sheer weight of the cafeteria tray. Giving
up on the rice cakes and the salad bar, complex carbohydrates are suddenly the constant companion of an athlete looking to
get a leg up on competitors whose schools
tend to be more palate-friendly.
5. Mad dashes out of the classroom.

Sure, discussion is exhilarating as usual,
but your bladder has developed a pulse. You
don't want to leave, and you don't want that
classful of freshmen wondering why you
don't have better bladder control. It's just
that you have already consumed nine of
those one-and-a-half-liter Evian bottles
before lunch, and you gotta pee! So when
those always-attentive, write-down-every-

thing-the-teacher-says-or-perish freshmen
give you the evil eye, stare them down and
"My team is in
either tell them the truth
the playoffs, and I am hydrating, so step
off!"
or tell them a lie that will freak 'em
out: "Early-onset incontinence is one of the
first signs of aging and will affect persons
as early as age 19." Write that in your notes.
6. Your Advil addiction. No, we aren't 65
years old, but after nearly six months of
playing basketball (taking preseason into
account), the wear and tear of the sport
begins to take its toll. You non-players
want to simulate the feeling: Jump up and
down in your dorm room for an hour every
day for the next six months and let us know
how your knees are holding up. So, we pop
a few over-the-counter pills every so often
to take the edge off. Supposedly some

aspirin products help prevent heart
attacks. In the meantime, two Aleve once a
day aren't going to kill us, except perhaps
if an arm happens to be ripped from the
body during the course of play, and a teammate has to point out the missing
appendage as it is lying on the other end of
the court and you had no idea because your
painkiller was doing its job.
7. The endorphins are a-buzzin' better
than aspirin and both dangerous and wonderful. Man, if only they could package the
feeling that you get when there are two
minutes left in the game and your team is

up by four points, all cylinders firing,
knowing you are going to win (because you
have Katie Robinson) and your body is as
close to operating like machinery as it can
possibly come. Such a drug would definitely be illegal. It's a high that simply can't be
synthetically duplicated. The only danger
is that, under the influence of this state, the
body's heightened senses don't include sensitivity to pain. Just ask Heather Kile 'O2,
whose leg is virtually a hardware store's
worth of construction, if it ever hurts during the course of a game. You can bet your

screwdriver that her answer is no.
8. Classroom performance is a secondtier priority for just one more week. We
know that the danger in even mentioning
this aspect of tournament time is that all
the non-athletes out there will jump to the
conclusion that once a jock, always a jock.
But, hey, our team GPA is pretty freakin'
good. So right now, in the name of honesty,
we can admit that, for one more crazy
week, our minds are occupied by one thing
and one thing only: winning. We may not
get to that 40-page reading or be able to
contribute as voraciously in class. A nap
becomes more important than the extracredit section of our problem sets. Getting
that 'A' on our response paper just isn't as
cool as getting the opportunity to put up
another banner in Tarble Pavilion. There
are lots of ways to bring pride to this campus, so bear with us in class, and we will
try to grab you an ECAC trophy.
Signs that what you have is something
other than playoff fever: bumps not including razor burn, hair loss, hair growth, bad
breath, drooling, erectile dysfunction, and
the way that Caitlin and Emily often feel on

'

Sunday mornings (assuredly not playoff-

related).

Men's lacrosse begins hard schedule with
10-9 OT victory over Mary Washington
BY JUSTIN KANE

jkanel@swarthmore.edu
Men's lacrosse head coach Pat Gress realizes that, to
most people, his team's schedule looks positively
Sisyphean.
The Garnet Tide play in what is quite possibly the
toughest conference in Division 111 men's lacrosse. The
team will face five opponents ranked in the top 25 of the
STX/USILA preseason coaches' poll No. 21 Wesleyan, No.
2 Gettysburg, No. 16 Western Maryland, No. 18 Franklin &
Marshall and No. 10 Washington College. It will play four of
those teams on the road. And the non-conference opponents
on the Tide's schedule aren't patsies, either.
But Gress remains undaunted. Though he admitted
that a one-loss season is little more than a pipe dream,
Gress expects his team to be able to hang with even the
top-ranked teams in the Centennial Conference. "We're
good enough to be in every game we play in the fourth
quarter," Gress said. "We prepare to win each game."
Gress and the Garnet Tide have started their uphill battle on the right foot, battling non-conference opponent
Mary Washington to the fourth quarter and beyond. The
Tide eked out a 10-9 overtime victory. Midfielder Than
Court 'O3 sealed the win with a goal with only 2L5 seconds

left in the extra period.
Control of the match seesawed back and forth much of
the game, reflecting what Gress called "inconsistent" play.
The Eagles flew out to a 2-0 first-quarter lead before the Tide
could muster any offense. When the Garnet finally began

THE

PHOENIX

scoring in the second quarter, attacker Joseph DeSimone 'O4
led the way, notching two goals. Along with goals from John

Cleaver 'O4 and JeffDonlea 'O5, DeSimone's offense gave the
Garnet a 4-2 lead going into the break.
Despite the halftime lead, the Garnet couldn't put Mary
Washington away. DeSimone struck again twice more, and
goals from Donlea, Dan Ingersoll 'O3 and Chung Lee 'O5
gave the Tide a 9-7 lead as the fourth quarter wound down.
But turnovers in the crucial final minutes allowed the
Eagles to tie the game, sending it into overtime.
The Tide will take on Manhattanville on the road this
Saturday at 1 p.m., and Gress said the team will be working to play more consistently. "We need to reduce our
turnovers on offense," Gress said. "We have to set up our
offense more predictably."
At the same time, Gress said he was pleased by the ability of the offense to create on the fly. "The offense made
some plays you just can't script," he said.
Gress's push for increased consistency also applies to
the Tide's defensive play and goaltending. Gress said the
occasional failure of defenders to help each other led to a
few breakdowns. The Garnet's two young goalkeepers,
Steven Isbister 'O4 and Ryan Croken 'O5, have been platooning in the net and competing for starts. "Switching
goalies at halftime can be a tricky situation," Gress said,
referring to the defensive adjustments required to platoon
goalkeepers. "But until one separates himself from the
other, we'll play both of them. There's no dropoff in skill."
For Gress, the Tide's apparently Sisyphean schedule
isn't as hopeless as it appears. With a young team, Gress
February 28, 2002

Defenseman Mike Weiner looks to pass in practice
said he wants to give everyone a chance to contribute and
to improve. Though he doesn't expect the Garnet Tide to go
undefeated, he's confident the team can compete successfully on its own terms in the Centennial Conference.
"We can be competitive in every game, and we'll
improve throughout the season," Gress said. "We just try
to play the best competition we can. It makes us a better
team."

Akpan takes six golds
BY MARK JANOFF
mjanoffl@swathmore.edu
Imo Akpan 'O2 broke several
school, meet and conference records
on her way to winning six gold medals
the
at
Centennial Conference
Championships last weekend at
Haverford. Akpan was also a unanimous pick for Outstanding Female
Athlete of the Meet.
"Being the unanimous pick was

really overwhelming," she said. "I
never really expected that."
In the 55-meter dash, Akpan edged
rival April Brown of Western

Maryland with a school record time of

7.20. The mark also earned Akpan an
automatic bid to compete at the NCAA
Division 111 nationals in the 55-meter.
She was also a mere one hundredth of
a second off of the conference record
time. Akpan thought she broke the
record in a preliminary heat, she said,
but the heats were timed with an accuracy of only one tenth of a second.
She still managed to capture conference records in both the 200-meter
dash and the 400-meter dash. She will
also compete in the 400-meter at
nationals, which does not offer competition in the 200-meter.
Akpan is still waiting for word on
whether she will compete in the long
jump at nationals. She provisionally
qualified for the tournament with a
meet record mark of 18'0.5". "I'd only
jumped at one meet and four practices,"
she said. "I was hoping to medal, but I
never expected to get first."
The most trying task of the meet for

22

may have been resisting
fatigue while competing in six events.
"I just tried to stay hydrated and stay
focused, especially doing so many
Akpan

events so close together," she said. She
had only a 40-minute respite between
the 400-meter and 55-meter finals. "For
the 55, it became more of a mental
thing, who's mentally tougher than
who," she said. She added that she
sensed some competitors underesti-

mated her because she had so little
time to recover between events. Akpan
said that only added fuel to her fire.
She also won both the distance medley relay (DMR) and the 4X400-meter
relay with teammates Claire Hoverman
'O3, Njideka Akunyili 'O4 and Elizabeth
Gardner 'O5. The group provisionally
qualified for nationals in the DMR.
"The relay hasn't run together that
much," Gardner said. "It was the first
time we had since the beginning of the
season." The lack of practice together
clearly did not hurt the group. "I think

we all knew

what

each

others'

strengths were," Hoverman added.
Gardner was the only Garnet runner besides Akpan to earn a medal in
an individual event. She placed third
in the 800-meter run, just ahead of
Hoverman and Akunyili. "I was a little
nervous the day before," Gardner said,
"but I ended up going in there really
relaxed. I just wanted to run the race."
Akpan hopes that her relay teammates will accompany her at nationals,
which take place next weekend, March
8 9, at Ohio Northern University. The
women finished sixth overall at the
-

conference

championships.

With the Tide's three-game winning streak
in jeopardy, Frank Visciano 'O4 chose the right
time to have an "out-of-body experience." With
a punishing first serve, the sophomore from
Englewood, Colorado led the team to a narrow
4-3 victory over opponent Fairleigh-Dickinson
University (FDU). "Frank played a great
game," Ben Rae 'O4 said.
With the match tied at three games apiece,
a crowd gathered at the Mullan Tennis Center
to watch Visciano's victory unfold. "With the
match tied up, the game came down to Frank,"
Justin Singer 'O3 said. "He won in front of
everybody."
Visciano started the match on fire and
never looked back. "I was nervous when I
started," he said, "but I knew that I had to put
pressure on my opponent."
He opened the game with a big first serve
to pick up the critical win and preserve
Swarthmore's four-game winning streak. "I
just had an out-of-body experience with my
serve," Visciano said.
Although top-seeded players John Thomas
'O2, Justin Singer 'O3 and Jayson Yost 'O3 each
dropped their singles matches, they played
against top-flight Division I opponents.
"Division I schools usually award athletic
scholarships to their top two or three players," Singer said. He dropped his match in
three sets to second seed George Green 4-6, 6-1,
6-3. "We have a much more balanced team; our

team's strength is in our fourth, fifth and sixth
seeded players."
After playing in the fifth seed as a freshman, Visciano only moved up to the numberfour seed this spring. "Frank only moving up
one spot shows that we're a strong team,"
Singer said.
"I feel that the greatest strength of our
team is depth
you don't see a large drop-off
in talent as you go down the lineup," sixthseed candidate Aaron Rubin 'O4 said.
After FDU's sixth seed failed to show up,
the doubles tandem of Thomas and Visciano
squeaked out an 8-6 victory over top seeded
Boris Bogdanov and Alex Sarria to clinch the
doubles point for the Tide. Rae also pulled out
an easy 6-2, 6-0 over FDU opponent Paul
Wawrynek 6-2, 6-0 in the fifth singles matchup.
"Ben played a great game," Visciano said.
"Our matches against Fairleigh-Dickinson
are usually this close," Rae said.
"It's a grudge match," Visciano added. "I
really liked the weight of the match on my

shoulders."
After two

more matches against
University of Chicago and Foothill College,
the Garnet Tide are heading to California
over spring break to face the University of
California at Berkeley, UC Davis and Sonoma
State. "The matches we play prior to and during spring break are against Division I and II
opponents, so they count on our record but do
not count toward our Division 111 rankings,"
Rubin said.
When the Tide returns, Division 111 play
resumes. "There is no doubt that the team's
goal is to make the national NCAA tournament and to compete for the National
Championship," Rubin said.

Ruggers to open season vs. Penn
BY TED CHAN AND RANDY GOLDSTEIN
tchanl@swarthmore.edu and
rgoldstl@swarthmore.edu

Things are looking up for the men's rugby
club this season. After losing many key players to graduation, the team struggled through
its fall season. Though the men trained hard
under the veteran leadership, scheduling
problems combined with dwindling spirits to
put a general damper on the team's morale.
This season, however, the team is under the
guidance of Fred Gruhler, a local club player
who is also an assistant coach to the USA
Rugby League team. Gruhler's experience and
hard-work mentality have translated into
improvements in the team's rugby ability.
The strength of the team will lie in the forward pack this season, where a promising
group of underclassmen will lead the way.
Savvy flanker Brian Kasch 'O2 and hooker
Manu Pradhan 'O3 are probably the team's
smartest and most seasoned players. A major
factor in the team's success will be the performance ofrookie Ed Sheldon 'O4, who will be
counted on to start at the key eight-man position.* Sheldon has shown his athletic ability
and blend of speed and size and is the jumper
on lineouts. The backbone of the pack, the
props and locks are perhaps the strongest unit
on the team when all are available. Randy
Goldstein 'O5 is a blend of power and athleticism, while John Turcik 'O5 and Anton Voinov
'O5 are hard-nosed big men who can push. The
team's most intimidating presence, though, is
that of its massive props, Brandon Carver 'O4,
a giant with frightening quickness and speed
for a man of his size, and Tim Lang 'O4, a veteran Canadian with incredible talent and the
ability to manipulate scrums. Powerful Asian

February 28, 2002

superman Joon Suk Choi 'O2 will add push to
pack.
Wearing the important nine and 10 jerseys
respectively are two internationals, captain
and scrumhalf Pablo Montagnes 'O2 and flyhalf Jon Fombonne 'O5. Fombonne breaks the
mold of a traditional flyhalf, as he is a big,
powerful runner. He brings key elements
missing last season as a skillful passer and

kicker from a position where those skills are

general necessities.
The team's most indispensable player is
the Canadian Montagnes. Besides the fact that
the team has no backup scrumhalf, Montagnes
is also the team's most experienced player.
The back line has been rebuilt into a strong

tackling unit with playmaking ability. At
inside center is the football team's former starting outside linebacker, Axel Neff 'O3, a powerful runner and devastating hitter. Ted Chan 'O2,
a shifty runner with kicking ability, will solidify at fullback and provide a reliable final line
of defense. Kyung Lee 'O2 could excel at almost
any position on the field, though his health has
been a major question. Kenny Oh 'O4 is a deft
passer and versatile player who will definitely
be in the lineup. Brian Hwang 'O5 is one of the
team's best athletes and should start even
though he is still learning the game. The team's
best playmaker is Erik Munroe 'O4, a sprinter
who will start at one of the wing positions. It's
unlikely Swarthmore will see a player who can
match up to Munroe speed wise.
The upcoming season looks to be a bright
one for the men's rugby club. Be sure to catch
them in their season opener this Saturday at 1
p.m. on Cunningham field in what promises to
be the toughest match of the year against the
sized and seasoned Division I squad from the
University of Pennsylvania.

Tide downs Del Val 74-59 to advance in ECAC
BY BRENDAN KARCH

bkarchl@swarthmore.edu

It's tournament time for the women's
basketball team, and for the four seniors on
the squad, every game could be their last at
Swarthmore. Last night, senior forward
Heather Kile made sure it wasn't.
Kile broke the Centennial Conference
career scoring record to lead No. 3 seed
Swarthmore past No. 6 seed Delaware
Valley at home, 74-59, in the first round of
the Eastern College Athletic Conference
(ECAC) tournament.
Kile scored 24 points and pulled down 12
rebounds, and Katie Robinson 'O4 added a
game-high 25 points and nine steals to lead

the Garnet.
With the win, Swarthmore advances to
the semifinal round of the ECAC tournament in a game against DeSales University
Saturday afternoon at Lebanon Valley

College.
In the game last night, Delaware Valley
had an obvious size and speed advantage
over Swarthmore. But the Garnet were
able to capitalize on sloppy play by the
Aggies, who committed 27 turnovers.
The Garnet were down early, 12-4, but
went on an 8-0 run to tie the game midway
through the first half. Sloppy play early by
both teams kept the game close. The Del
Val Aggies committed 14 turnovers in the
first half while the Garnet turned the ball
over 11 times.
The game went back and forth for most
of the half, but Swarthmore opened up a
small lead thanks to three turnovers in the
last minute and entered halftime up 37-32.
"I think we were a little intimidated,"
said Robinson. "They looked really fast. We
just slowed down the tempo and took control of the game."
Kile had a double-double in the first
half, scoring 15 points on 5-for-8 shooting
and grabbing 10 rebounds. The Aggies'
leading scorer on the season, Kristen
Henry, scored 16 first-half points, including
going 3-for-3 from 3-point range. Henry
scored 25 points on the game.
With 14:38 remaining in the second half,
Kile put in an inside shot to catapult her
into first place in scoring in conference history. Kile topped the previous mark of 1,944
points held by Johns Hopkins' Julie

Anderson.
Kile's basket also opened a 15-1 run for
Swarthmore that would put the game out of
reach for Delaware Valley. Robinson and
Ali Furman 'O3 combined for 13 of the
team's 15 points during the six-and-a-half
minute stretch. The Garnet went up by as
many as 23 points and never lost its double-

digit lead.
The win came after Swarthmore's worst
loss of the season, 66-38, in the Centennial
Conference Championship game Saturday
at Western Maryland.
In the game against Western Maryland,
the Garnet came out flat, going down early
14-3, and was never able to recover.
"I think that they're a beatable team
and that when a few shots didn't fall in the
beginning, we lost our confidence," said
center Caitlin Ryland 'O2. Swarthmore
started the game with three turnovers and
watched the Green Terror jump to a 6-0
lead. The Garnet called a timeout but could
not reverse the momentum.
"It just seemed like one mistake led to

another," Kile said.

Kile did not get off a single shot attempt
in the first half, but still managed 10 points
before fouling out with about six minutes
remaining. Robinson, the only other
Swarthmore player in double figures, led
the team with 12 points.
In what Kile described as "an off day in
probably every regard," adjustments
seemed futile. "We tried to do just about
everything, from changing defenses, to trying different things offensively, to putting
different people in the game, to timeouts,"
head coach Adrienne Shibles said.
The team pulled within 15 points early
in the second half thanks to some inside
scoring, but Western Maryland then
opened up a 16-3 run to put the game out of

reach.
The Garnet set several season lows
Saturday: total points (38), first-half points
(12), first-half field goals (4) and shooting
percentage (19 percent), and total assists
(5).

As Ryland noted about Western
Maryland: "It didn't help that they were
absolutely on fire." Two weeks before the
end of the season, the Green Terror had
only an outside chance of making the playoffs. But then the team won its final six regular season games to force a tiebreaker
against Johns Hopkins. After knocking
Hopkins out of playoff contention,
Maryland then traveled to heavily favored
Muhlenberg and pulled off a 53-52 upset.
Because home court advantage in the

conference title game switches each year
between divisions, Western Maryland got
to host Swarthmore despite the Garnet's
better record.
Swarthmore earned a bid in the ECAC
tournament after failing to gain entry to
the NCAA Division 111 tournament.
The winner of the Centennial
Conference gains an automatic bid into the
tournament, but only six at-large bids are

offered nationwide into the NCAA tournament. Swarthmore knew its only real
chance to enter the tournament would
come through a conference title.
Swarthmore earned the No. 3 ranking
out of six teams in the ECAC bracket. This
Saturday they will play the N0.2 seed,
DeSales University, on the home court of
Lebanon Valley College, which earned the
No. 1 seed. Last night, N0.4 seeded
Franklin & Marshall beat N0.5 Johns
Hopkins, 75-56. F&M will play Lebanon
Valley in the other semifinal matchup on
Saturday; the championship game will be

played Sunday at noon.
Swarthmore has not played DeSales in

the past four years, so none of the Garnet

players know the other team. DeSales
comes into the game with a 19-7 record,
and plays a style of athletic, scrappy ball
similar to Delaware Valley.
The Garnet have, at most, two games
remaining on the season. "For the senior
class especially, we're very ,very excited to
still be playing in a Swarthmore uniform,"
said Ryland. "It's been so much fun. And
we just keep wanting to have fun as long as
we can."

Before the final relays, the Swarthmore women gathered, and Ladewski told the team that they had won the
championship regardless of the result of the relay.
Respectful of the other teams, there was no cheering or
lack of effort in the relays. The Swarthmore 400 freestyle

Briones won with a national B qualifying time (3:37.68) and
a new college record.

Sunday was the men's weakest day with no finals
swims in the 1650 free, 100 freestyle and 200 backstroke.
However, two men made it into the 200 breaststroke;
Dudley took second (2:09.09) with a national B cut and
Shang sixth (2:19.94). Four men placed in finals in the 200
butterfly; Whitehead was first with a time of 1:55.58 (a
national B cut), Lillvis second (1:57.22), Auerbach sixth
(2:02.37), and Modic seventh (2:06.51).
The final scores for the women were Swarthmore, 707,
with Gettysburg and Washington trailing with 604.5 and
542.5 points, respectively. The final score for the men was
F&M 752, Gettysburg 722, Dickinson 584.5, Swarthmore 545,
Western Maryland 30L5, Washington 268 and Ursinus 184.

ference record. The women's 200 freestyle, 50 freestyle and
100 freestyle were much quicker; times that would have
won in past years placed third or fourth. But the women
rose to the challenge, winning with a 100-point margin, 60
points better than last year, and winning finals and consolations of all three freestyle relays, a never done feat for
the Swarthmore women. It was not only first-throughthird placed swims, but the depth of the Swarthmore
women's team that allowed them to win by such a large
margin.

The men also struggled with this meet but left with
handful ofnational B cuts and college records of which any
team would be proud. The women with national B cuts will
find out today whether they actually got into nationals,
and the men will find out next Thursday.

The Garnet women swimmers took the Centennial
Conference Championship by a margin of over 100 points,
becoming one of three Swarthmore women's teams to win
back-to-back conference championships. The men's team
was battered from various ailments and placed fourth,
although there were many phenomenal swims.
Eight women and three men made national B cuts
either in relays or individual events, more than the
Swarthmore swim team has ever had before. Six college
records and one conference record were broken.
The women's team had one individual and three relay
first-place finishes, four individual second-place finishes,
three individual third-place finishes, and one relay thirdplace finish. The men's team had five individual first-place
finishes, three individual second-place finishes, and three
relay third-place finishes.
"Our success at conferences was a combination of outstanding individual swims and unbelievable team effort,"
Amy Auerbach 'O2 said. "It was one of the most amazing
swimming experiences of my life."
Friday morning after a two-and-a-half hour bus ride,
the team walked into the Franklin & Marshall pool for the
first of three very long days. The women's team was not
seeded first in any event heading into the weekend and did
not expect to defend its championship successfully.
Finals that night began on a high note
the first-place
finish of the 200 freestyle relay. Natalie Briones 'O3,

Katherine Stauffer 'OS, Leah Davis 'O4 and Davita
Burkhead-Weiner 'O3 took first with a time of 1:3916, breaking last year's college record by almost two seconds. This
was the first national B cut of the meet.
Meredith Leigh 'O3 placed fourth in the 500 freestyle
(5:17.39). Briones placed second in the 200 individual medley, making a national B cut with a time of 2:12.03. In the 50

sixth (25.61). The evening concluded with
a Garnet Tide third-place finish in the 400
medley relay (Christie Tomm 'OS, Briones,

Burkhead-Weiner and Melanie Johncilla
'OS). By the end of competition on Friday,
the women already held the lead by 40
points.
The men began the Friday finals with a
third-place finish in the 200 freestyle relay
by a team of Jacob Ross 'OS, Michael
Auerbach 'OS, Mike Dudley 'O3 and John
Lillvis 'O3. Dudley won the 200 IM with a
time of 1:56.28, a new college record
(breaking Ted Sherer's ['ol] 2000 record of
1:57.31), while Lillvis was right behind him
with a second place finish of 1:57.64. The
men, like the women, placed third in the
400 medley relay with a team of Ross,
Dudley, Lillvis

and Whitehead.

Saturday evening, an exhausted but
excited team gathered to cheer and to start
the second of the three finals sessions.

The women finished Saturday night still in the lead,
By Saturday evening, the men's team was suffering.
Seventy-five yards into a phenomenal 100 backstroke
swim, Ross's shoulder popped out of the socket, and he finished his race with his shoulder completely dislocated. By
the time he was pulled out of the water, his muscles were
too tight to allow the trainers to put his shoulder back in.
Ross was out for the rest of the meet.
Between Jeff Schnieder 'os's twisted ankle, Ross's dislocated shoulder, Whitehead's cold and Chris Rose'os's
split heel, the men's team was not in great shape. The men
began the finals round of Saturday's events with a thirdplace medley relay of Chris Bussard 'O3, Dudley, Auerbach
and Whitehead. Lillvis won the 400 IM (4:1L49) making a
national B cut and breaking his own 2000 college record of
4:12.23. Whitehead won the 100 butterfly (52.10). Dudley won
the 100 breaststroke (59.25), and Shang placed sixth
(1:03.72). The evening finished with the Garnet men in
fourth overall and the 800 free relay team of Whitehead,
Bussard, Auerbach and Lillvis swimming to a fourth-place
finish.

Plagued by injuries, the young men's team finished fourth overall in the championships. A highlight of competion was
Mike Dudley's record-breaking time of 1:56.28 in the 200 IM to take gold. John Lillvis finshed second in the event.
