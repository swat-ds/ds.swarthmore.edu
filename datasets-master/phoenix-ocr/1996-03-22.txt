Lani Guinier Calls for "Quaker-Style" Discussion to Resolve Society's Problems
By

Erik Huneke

"Strange name, strange hair,
strange ideas": this is the image Lani
Guinier, professor at the University
ofPennsylvania Law School and 1993
nominee for the position of assistant
attorney general for civil rights,
claims her detractors had of her. But
it was precisely Guinier's "strange"
ideas thatreceived a standing ovation
after her lecture Tuesday evening in
the Lang Performing Arts Center.
Guinier said that "part of the problem of politics today is that it takes a
while for new ideas to be heard."
As evidence, she cited a speech in
which President Bill Clinton claimed
that "government is not a one-sizefits-all bureaucracy" and that "we
don't want to have a winner-take-all
system." Guinier said thosevery ideas
were expressed in the articles she
wrote with which Clinton disagreed
during the controversy over hernomination.
In her talk, she hoped to introduce
even more new ideas into political
discourse, to challenge "some of the
assumptions underlying the current
affirmative action debate." To this
end, Guinier asked four questions:
•"What is fairness?"
•"What is merit?"
•"What is diversity?"
•"How can we work through these
issues to come up with some kind
of solution?"
Guinier challenged the notion that
fairness necessarily means "treating
everyone the same." In noting that

"many people think that affirmative
action presents a challenge to meritbased decision-making," she asked
the audience to reconsider: "What do
we mean by being qualified in the
first place?" and "Can we know in
advance whether someone is qualified?"
Challenges Traditional
Definitions of Diversity
She disputed a notion of diversity
which involves only "adding women
and stirring" or adding traditionally
excluded groups and "callfing] it a
melting pot."
To substantiate her claims, Guinier
described a study which showed that
while male and female students entered the University of Pennsylvania
Law School with virtually identical
credentials, "by the end of the first
year, the men were rising to the top
[of their class] and the women were
sinking to the bottom." The trend

persisted over three years, although it
lessened in degree toward the end.
Guinierattributed this to a pedagogicalmethod which makes women more
likely than men to remain silent in
class. She was troubled, however,
that although women at first are unhappy about being silent, they became less disturbed by it in their third
year of law school.
Guinier said her colleagues at Penn
gave a variety of reasons for this. One
suggested, "Maybe we're admitting
the wrong women." Another said that
men who had been distracted by varsity sports in college could "really
shine" academically once in law
school.
Yet another believed that women' s
lack ofassertiveness wouldkeep them
from becoming effective "agents of
social change" and "good lawyers."
Needless to say, Guinier was not completely satisfied by these explanations.
She instead believes that men were
more willing to catch on to how most
professors engage in Socratic dialogue with students, which Guinier
characterized as a game of "learning
how to ask rude questions." She said
that men "know they want to talk, but
they don't know what to say," and
then "treat the entire class to their
thought process" so that "everyone is
participating in their learning."
The Penn study found that "women
want to talk when it's relevant" or
connected to what others have already said. Even then, a woman's
comment is typically "so brief, so
pithy, it's like a haiku poem." While
men felt even slightly more comfortable approaching female than male
professors, women apparently didn't
feel comfortable approaching professors of either gender.
The equal treatment offered by law
professors, whom Guinier characterized as "not warm and fuzzy people,"
was not really fair to "women [who]
waited for friendliness cues....
They're still waiting."

scores have been shown to be correlated most with the income of students' parents, she said.
A study of Harvard and Radcliffe
College graduates found that success, as measured by financial status,
professional satisfaction, and community service, was correlated with
relatively low SAT scores and a bluecollar background. In short, Guinier
said, motivation seemed to be the
best predictor of performance.
She cited another study which
found that while African American
students in a California college math
class scored lower than Asian American classmates with similar backgrounds, their scores exceeded those

of the Asian Americans when a
mentoring program helped the African Americans to adopt some of the
Asian Americans' group studying
methods.
The need to go beyond one-sizefits-all measures extended to theNew
York City Police Department, which
used to require its officers to be at
least six feet tall. A group of women
successfully challenged this provision, which also allowed more Asian,
Latino, and even "short white men"
to join the force.
Researchers then discovered that
female officers serving as mentors
were actually more successful at dissipating violence among young men

First Person

Spur-of-the-Moment Decision Changes a Life
By

Thanh Hoang

I wasn't even supposed to be
here in America; my older sister
Mai was. Fifteen years later, I still
marvel at howmy life was changed
forever because I happened to be
at the right place at the right time.
It was evening, and my father
and I were packing my sister's
things into our oxen-drawn cart. I
was confused as to why we were
doing this, but being achild of five
years ofage, I wasn't supposed to
know much anyway.
Unbeknownst to me, my second
oldest sister Hanh, her husband,
and theirchildren planned to leave
Vietnam for America that night. If
we didn't take their things, everything would be confiscated the
next day when the soldiers discovered their escape. My next
older sister Mai was supposed to
go, too; their passages on the refugee boat had already been bought
with gold bars. I realize now that
had everything gone according to
plan, it would have been the last
time I would see my sisters.
When my fatherand I were preparing to leave, we discovered that
the oxen wouldn't budge. The cart
was too heavy and my father, in
his 50s and small of frame, could

not control them. I couldn't do much
either because I was so small. Since
Mai was several years older and bigger, my father decided to have her
stay back to drive the cart home.
This spontaneous decision changed
the course of my life. Because there
were no refunds for the trip, my fathertold my oldest sister to take me in
place ofMai. I only knew that my dad
was telling me to stay with my sister.
Since I had slept at her place many
times, I didn't wonder why. My father left with Mai, and I stayed with
my sister, not suspecting that I was
going to lead a totally different life
from the rest of my family; I didn't
know then that it would be the last
time I would see my father or sister.
I didn't even get to say good-bye to
my mother or my siblings.
The next thing I knew, it was midnight. I was following my sister and
her two toddler sons through alleyways, trying hard not to be seen. I
didn't know what was going on; I just
followed wherever she led. As we
neared the bay, I saw her husband on
our family boat. I remember being
ushered below the deck and my sister
telling me to be silent.
I was getting a little suspicious as
to what was going on. Why all the
sneaking around? What were we doing at the wharf so late at night? Most

groups should be included not just
because it is "nice," but because they
can bring new perspectives. In a society with many issues to confront,
"the more complicated the problem,
the more diverse a group of problemsolvers you need," she said.
She noted that her third-grade son

More Perspectives Needed

Nicholas likes the fact that his mother

"gets to be boss" but regrets that she
does not get to play games. Guinier
had identified both activities as frequently occurring male interests.
Yet because Nicholas comes from
a family in which the mother occupies a more prominent public role
than the father, he could ask a classmate who was bragging about how
his mother's job as vice-president of
a bank: "Why isn't she president?"
The lecture was co-sponsored by

BCC, the IC, the Women's Studies
Program, the Black Studies Program,
and the Department of Political Science.

Test Scores Poor Predictors of

One-size-fits-all predictors of performance are just as bad as one-sizefits-all measures of performance in
Guinier's mind. She argued
that "what we are using to predict
performance is not a very good predictor, since only "21 percent of
third-year law students at Penn perform as predicted by the LSAT."
Furthermore, both LSAT and SAT

in urban housing projects, and were
also more adept at handling cases of
domestic violence, Guinier said.
Guinier argued that all of these
cases demonstrate the need for what
she termed "Quaker-style decisionmaking."

of all, why was my sister so intent in
not being seen?But she wouldn't tell
me anything, except to be quiet.
With my brother-in-law the only
person on deck, the boat slowly and
silently crept out to sea. I remember
feeling seasick and trying to hold
back my nausea, but I threw up despite my attempt. Suddenly, there
was a stranger's voice on deck. I
recall my sister getting tense and whispering to me to be extra quiet. We
listened intently to the exchange
above us. A neighbor on a passing
boat had recognized my brother-inlaw and wondered where he was going at such a late hour. My brother-inlaw feigned calmness and answered
that he was going fishing. Both my
sister and I breathed a sigh of relief
when the man said good-bye, apparently without suspecting a thing.
We encountered another boat in
the middle of the ocean. This time,
my brother yelled for us to come on
deck. It seemed like we had reached
our destination. I noticed that there
were many other people on the boat
as we joined them and my brother-inlaw left our boat to drift. To my
surprise, two of my older brothers
and another older sister and her husband and children were also on the
boat! What were they doing here and
where were we anyway? I turned to

ask one of my brothers, and like
my sister, he just told be to be
quiet. They were talking to some
other men holding some paper. I
turned in search of my mother, but
couldn't spot her, so I asked another sister. She told me Mom was
around the other side of the boat
and would return soon. I believed
her and waited for Mom.
My sisters, brothers, and I were
ushered into one of the cabins.
Mom still hadn't shown up. I was
getting worried that something
might have happened to her. I
asked my sister again, and she told
me that Mom was on another boat
and that we were going to meet
her. I was reassured.
We traveled for what seemed
like months, until one day we were
pulled in by a Malaysian coast
guard boat. They asked for identification, dates of birth and the
like. My older brothers and sisters
didn't think to bring these documents. So my oldest sister just
estimated our ages and made up
some dates. She chose June 1,
1975 for me, and it was only years
later that I discovered from my
mom that I was actually born on
October 19, 1973.

All students who participate in the
housing lottery for next year will
recieve College housing, the Housing Committee announced after its
last meeting before spring break.
If demand for rooms exceeds the
number available in the dorms, the
College will arrange for rooms offcampus. The overflow housing will
have College phones and computer
network hookups.
Director of Residential Life Myrt
Westphal explained the change in an
interview Wednesday. "This year
there's more pre-planning. We're saying to students that we may have to
acquire overflow housing."
Westphal said that the guarantee
isn't "ironclad," but that she believes
everyone will be housed. She also
said that in past years all students
who entered the lottery at any time
were able to receive College housing. This year, however, students
entering the lottery late "do not have
as much of an assurance" that they
will receive housing.
According to Westphal, the housing crunch next year will be eliminated in two ways:
•The College will acquire overflow housing if necessary. Overflow
housing had been discussed in the
past but nothing concrete was ever
established. "Now, we have overflow housing lined up for next year if
we need it. We have a couple sites in
mind," says Westphal. Overflow
housing will be similar to residence
hall housing in that there will be
group living, RAs, computer network
connections, and College furniture
and phones. The overflow housing
will also be included on the shuttle
routes.

•Empty beds will be filled. Housing Committee strongly urged students not to choose roommates who
will be gone for a semester with the
expectation of having a single for
that time, because another student
may be assigned to the empty bed. "A
lot of schools are ruthless aboutthis,"
Westphal explains. "We're not going
to be ruthless, but students need to
know that we will fill these beds if we
have to."
One hoped-for effect ofthe changes
is to eliminate the anxiety of rising
sophomores who need to decide
whether they will live off-campus,
and if so, where they will live.
Westphal said, "Many sophomores
live off-campus and are very successful. However, some parents and
administrators thinkthat sophomores
aren'tready to live off-campus." The
change allows Swarthmore to accommodate all rising sophomores.

The Housing Committee made
other changes in the lottery to ensure
that students receive appropriate living space for their class year. The
committee defines appropriate space
as shared space forrising sophomores
and some sort of single space for
rising juniors and seniors.
According to a statement from committee member Laura Gitelson, if a
rising junior chooses to live with one
or more rising sophomores, the two
students' numbers will be averaged.
In the past, sophomore-junior pairs
were allowed to choose with the
junior's number.
A junior's number will never average to lower than the highest sophomore number—-that is, all rising juniors will choose their housing on the
night of rising junior room draw.
Numbers are already averaged
when rising sophomores and rising
seniors choose rooms together.
The change is expected to discourage the fraudulent room-choosing
practices that caused problems in the
housing lottery last year.
In addition, juniors will no longer
be forced to choose shared space if
that is all that remains at the end of
their lottery. If by the time a rising
junior's number is called there are no
more singles, two-room doubles, or
three-room triples left anywhere in
college housing, he or she will be
allowed to go on a waiting list for
individual space.
Most summers, a number of single
spaces open up when students decide
to take leaves or move off campus;
the rising juniors on the waiting list
would be offered those spaces.
Housing Committee expects the
new rule will eliminate the large number of room-change requests which
result from rising juniorsbeing forced
to choose one-room doubles.
Westphal said she cannot fully determine the housing situation until
she knows how many students are
entering the College next year, how
many are going on leave, how many
are studying abroad, and how many
plan to live off-campus.
All of the variables involved in the
process make it hard to gauge the
probable effect of the decision. Betsy
Geiger '96, a committee member,
said, "Like most aspects of housing
policy, thedecision to guarantee housing has pros and cons. I can't really
comment on what thosepros and cons
will be because I don't know what
type of housing the college has acquired, and how that space is to be
filled; both of these factors will have
a substantial effect on the impact of
the overflow housing on the lottery
process and on the housing situation
in general."

Opinions Differ on Likelihood of
War Between China and Taiwan
By

Jessica Harbour

"The Western medialike to play it
up as this big confrontation...but I
think a lot of Taiwanese don't think
China will invade...lt's not a major
concern,"commented lan Chang' 97
at Wednesday's Pacific Rim Organization meeting.
, With the island of Taiwan, known
officially as the Republic of China,
staging full democratic elections on
Saturday, many people are worried
aboutits future relationship with the
mainland People's Republic of
China. While Taiwan is officially
recognized as part of China, a Taiwanese independence movement
remains strong, and Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui has publicly supported the idea of breaking from
China. The possibility of conflicts
between Communist China and
democraticTaiwan haveloomed ever
larger this month, with China firing
missiles into waters near Taiwan and
Chinese military staging drills with
live ammunition on Taiwanese soil.
Since the United States has sent military personnel to Taiwan, the threat
of crisis has pricked up the ears of
many Americans, at Swarthmore and
elsewhere.
The American media has paid a
fair amount of attention to the conflict; many Swarfhmore students
have read about it in The New York

Times, Time, Newsweek, or other majorpublications. The New York Times
recently devoted almost an entire issue of its Sunday magazine to Chinarelated issues; the World Press Review collected opinions from around
the world about China in a single
issue; and the New Yorker, in its
most recent issue, opened with an
editorial calling for the Clinton Presidency to be more "hostile" to China:
"China, instead ofcompromising, has
bullied and blustered...the Communist Party is running out of reasons to
justify its political dictatorship."
Several Swarthmore students have
expressed concern about the situation. Cynthia Hong '97 circulated to
Pacific Rim Organization (PRO)
members a series ofarticles and editorials from various publications concerning China and Taiwan. Josh
Lifton '9B, a PRO member, said he
was planning to study in Taiwan next
year, but added, "If war breaks out,
I'm probably not going to go." However, American feeling does not necessarily translate into Taiwanese feeling. Paul Hsu '9B, who lived in Taiwan for thirteen years, called his parents in Taiwan and reported, "They
said there's really nothing to worry
about, that it'll blow over after
elections...they think that after the
elections, Lee [Teng-hui] will back
off the independence issue and let
things cool down."

Democracy and Friendship

At Wednesday's PRO meeting, two
students who spent last semester in
Taiwan, lan Chang '97 and Steven
Chang '97, talkedabout their experiences. Lan Chang spent his semester
at Taiwan Normal University in
Taiwan'scapital.Taipei, whileSteven
Chang studied at Tunghai University
in the smaller town of Taichung. The
two students spoke about their experiences studying a foreign country
cultural differences, learning the language what advice they would give
others who wanted to study in Taiwan. When the issue of politics was
raised, Steven Chang said, "When I
was there, they were having elections
for Parliament, but it's not as
big...among college students."
After listening to their talk, Lifton
had a new theory about Western coverage of the Taiwanese-Chinese confrontation. "As a representative of
"Circling the Square" [WSRN's conspiracy talk show], I think it's definitely a conspiracy of the advertising
conglomerate—because media's going downhill, nobody really watches
television anymore, and if there's a
war, people will watch more TV."
But lan Chang probably said it best
when he stated, "After those elections happen, [it] will become more
clear how things are going to be in
Taiwan." So interestedTaiwan watchers should probably wait before jumping to any conclusions.

FAFSA Problems Will Not Affect Swat
By Tony

Sturm

A governmental backlog offederal
financial aid applications will not affect students at Swarthmore, according to Director ofFinancial AidLaura
Talbot. Due to computer problems,
the federal shutdown and the bad
weather earlier this year, the U.S.
Department of Education has had
problems processing the Free Applications for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA) in a timely manner.
It usually takes only two weeks for
the applications to be processed; they
are needed by students who are hoping for any federal financial aid and
required for Swarthmorefinancial aid
applicants. But they are currently tak-

ing as long as two months to get back.
This will not affect any students
applying for financial aid at
S warthmore, either currently enrolled
students looking to renew their aid
packages or applicants who are expecting financial aid packages in the
mail with their acceptance notices.
"Delays in the federal aid delivery
system have been common over the
years so we have made certain not to
depend on it," Talbot said.
Swarthmore has its own application,
and only uses FAFSA to determine
the federalmoney that a student would
receive. Swarthmore students obtain
about 5 percent of their grants feder-

ally.

3,000 aid applications from prospective members of the Class of 2000 we
will start reviewing aid applications
for our current students. All is still on
schedule for us to announce those aid
decisions in late May and June," said
Talbot.
The financial aid packages sent out
will include an estimate of a student's
federal aid eligibility, which is later
finalized when the College receives
the federal eligibility report in May.
"Public universities, however, are
affectedbecause they have only public money to offer their students and
so must rely on the federal allocation
system," she noted. Most schools,
including Swarthmore, have a May 1
deadline for accepted students to enroll. Many students use financial
packages to determine which school
they will eventually matriculate. But
withthe prospect of not having financial aid packages from some, students would be more blind in making
their decision, putting both schools
and students in a pinch.
So while thousandsof students and
colleges around the country will be
adversely affected by this delay,
Swarthmore aid applicants will not.

Negrón Speaks on Identity Politics and Film
By

Desiree Joseph

Poet, film maker, and doctoral candidate Frances Negr6n spoke to a
groupofstudents and faculty Wednesday on the topic "Latinas, Lesbians,
Women, the Arts." Negr6n began by
reading her poem "Transformations"
and her essay entitled, "Beyond the
Cinema of 'The Others': Towards
Another Cinema" and then took some
questions.
Negr6n, who hasbeen making films
for eight years, spoke about feeling
like a "type cast actor... continuously
called upon to say certain things." As
a Puerto Rican, lesbian film maker
and academic she said she is perceived only in the context of her
sexuality or her ethnicity. People ask
"How can a Puerto Rican make films,
go to college?"—In essence, "How is
it that you exist?" Negrdn noted that
while inquiry into issues of so-called
"identity politics" is valid—identity
politics brought her to lecture at
Swarthmore in the first place —it can
also be limiting. "If you are only
called upon to talk about yourself as
a person of color, you can't be your
whole complexity. However, cinema
has often been a plane ticket to places
I never wanted to go," she says.
Negr6n has shown her work to a
variety of audiences, including gay
American Latinos, Berkeley intellectuals, Puerto Ricans at film festivals.
Each time the response has been different. "I was connecting with the
young people, those under 25,"
Negr6n concludes.

Frances

Negron

The media in general gave her positive reviews, but many intellectuals
were less enthusiastic because,
Negr6n suspects, they are "linked to
certain narratives that I'm trying to
destroy...But they can't touch me,"
she adds, "because they'd be called

homophobic."
However, Negron herself is, in one

facet, an intellectual. She is currently
pursuing a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature. When asked why, she replied, "Because it's a requirement in

my family to get
one." Negr6n notes
that America is exceptional in its isolation of academia
from and politics.
"The American
academy," she says,
"is so divorced from
reality." Shecitesnot
only the organization
of the universities
and colleges but, in
some cases, physical
structures and locations that predispose
them to isolation. In
Puerto Rico and in
much of the world,
Negr6n claims, the
universities are centers of "ideological
contestation," greatly
relevant to the politics of the countries
in which they exist.
Photo by Rob Monk She is critical of how
PuertoRican intellectuals manage their power, but she
says that they have an "arena of relevance" generally lacking in American academia.
NegroVs films include Brincando
alCharco: Portrait ofaPuertoRican,
which will be shown on Saturday,
March 30th at 1 p.m. in the LP AC
Cinema as part of the Sager Symposium; Aids in the Barrio; and her
latest, Homeless Diaries, a dialogue
withseveralhomeless advocates from
North Philadelphia.

around 200 of which are from other
countries."
Swarthmore students have been
studying abroad at the University of
Ghana in small numbers for years
now, and this tradition continues with
Danielle Anctil '97 this semester. For
more than twenty years, professors
from the University have visited
Swarthmore and spent a term teaching here. Ghanaian students have attended Swarthmore for many years.
There are also faculty members at
Swarthmore who have gone to the
University forresearch purposes and
other professional commitments.
The program first began when
Raymond Hopkins, professor of po-

litical science at Swarthmore, visited
the University of Ghana.While there,
he worked out an arrangement for
interested students to stay at the University for a term. More recently, in
the summer of 1994, he went back
and worked out a more extensive
arrangement with the University.
Since then, approximately twelve to
fifteen students have stayed at the
University.
"We are so impressed with the quality of faculty at the University of
Ghana," said Piker. "There are wonderful people, it is a wonderful culture. Ghana is also among the most
politically stable countries in Africa."
Each of the Swarthmore students who
have spent a term at the University of

Ghana have been"extraordinarily
enthusiastic"about their experiences.
Students who are interesting in acquiring more information on the opportunity to study in Ghana are encouraged to contact Steven Piker,
Foreign Study Advisor at spikerl.
Dr. Akosua Anyidoho, a University of Ghana professor of linguistics
who oversees contact with
Swarthmore, will be coming to the
campus for two weeks beginning
April 22. Dr. Anyidoho will be available to meet any student who expresses interest in the program. "It's
a great opportunity," saidPiker. "Most
students going abroad don't get to
meet people [from where they're going] beforehand."

News Viewpoint: BCC Announces Colloquium
By

Tamala Montgomery

This past Tuesday night, blackfaculty, staff and students gathered to
organize the BCC Colloquium, which
will occur during Black Alumni
Weekend on March 23.
The colloquium is the initiative of
the BCC and four students: Kesia
Constantine '96, Patrice Bone '96,
Angela Mrema '96, and Rebeccah
Bennett '96. The idea for the BCC
Colloquium grew out of a long discussion following the Black Oral
History Lecture in February. In 1970
and again in 1980, the college made
an official commitment to increase
the recruitment and retention of African American students and faculty.
The college has not fulfilled its promise. African American students barely
comprise five percent of the student
population, while representation in
the faculty is also low.
The colloquium aims to galvanize
the support of black faculty, staff,
students, and alumni around this and
other issues. However, subsequent

meetings will seek the input and support ofall members of theSwarthmore
community who care about these issues. The planners will present the
report in faculty meetings to get these
issues "on the lips of the faculty,"
according to Bone.
The colloquium will begin with
breakfast and registration and following a thirty minute "state of affairs at Swarthmore" address. Participants choose one of the six foci of
the colloquium, such as admissions,
curriculum, and faculty hiring. Then,
they will hold workshops to produce
specific policy recommendations.
Bennett explained the push to bring
these issues to the fore at this time:
"We wanted to make sure that we got
that process rolling this year because
we haven't seen these kinds of initiatives being done in our community—in the black community—with regards to articulating a vision and a
comprehensive plan...We recognize
that it's not going to be done by this
semester, but we want people to start
thinking about it, particularly because

CEP is meeting next year to develop
a comprehensive plan for the college
over the next ten years. When they
start that process, we want them to
have our document in place so that
our suggestions, our vision, and our
specific recommendations will be
given a certain amount of weight in
those deliberations and that we've
already articulated. In a formalized
manner, we're not simply saying,
'You' re not doing enough,' but here' s
what we think you need to do...We
don'tanticipate majorchange by next
year, but we have a pressing need to
get a document out. We want to make
sure that by that time, faculty have
already heard our ideas so they can
propel change. We don't want the
Board faced with a discussion group
next year that they don't know the
origin of. Hopefully out of this process will come a campaign with regard to finances and other things that
really show an institutional commitment to doing whatever it takes to
increase black studentenrollmentand
black faculty hiring."

Housing reforms welcome, even

if inadequate.

We applaud the Housing Committee's recent policy changes and their
commitment to prevent anxiety during room choosing. The decision to
average lottery numbers whenrising sophomores and rising juniors choose to
live together will limit the opportunities for students to choose rooms with
people other than their intended roommates solely so they can pick on higher
numbers, and will therefore eliminate the need for draconian policies about
room changes after the lottery. Moreover, the change will not discriminate
against inter-class friendships: even if a sophomore were to room with a
junior, the resulting number would always remain within the junior class
lottery. Thus, juniors are guaranteed to find housing appropriate to theirclass
status, whatever the class of their roommates.
Unfortunately, however, the factor that induced sophomores and juniors to
cheat in the first place —the crunch at the bottom of the lottery —still exists,
even if the avenues for cheating are reduced. The recommended policy would
place those sophomores who do not obtain housing through the lottery in
overflow housing ifby September there are no empty spaces on campus. This
addresses the difficulties of sophomores obtaining off-campus accommodations, but it would leave many rising sophomores unable to control where and
with whom they live. The RAs, telephone system and other amenities to be
provided with the overflow housing are nice, yes, but the fact remains that
many sophomores will simply have no idea where they will live next year.
We also wonder where, exactly, the overflow housing will be. The College
cannot just rent a few apartments in some building where students have
always lived. That will displace individuals who want to live off-campus,
shifting the burden of the housing shortage to a different group. Needless to
say, giving students who want to live on campus (that's why they participated
in the lottery, right?) accommodations in an apartment in the ville does not
really solve problems. It seems that the students with the lowest lottery
numbers will either have to choose to live off-campus, or the College will find
themhousing off-campus. And we wonder whetherSwarthmore could afford,
ifnecessary, to build new housing, given the recent debate over how much the
College can afford to spend on financial aid.
We support both the spirit and the bulk of the policies in the Housing
Committee's recommendations, and we hope that there are fewer injustices
and abuses in the lottery process this year. But given the potential for
continued troubles, we are wary of viewing the sophomore problem as solved:
there may yet be a better way.
As long as many students continue to choose rooms in the lottery, then
notify Swarthmore over the summer that they will not live in those rooms,
some students will leave the lottery without rooms, and will have to take their
chances withthe waiting list. And as long as enrollment is set at a level which
leaves little, if any, extra space in the dorms, there will always be the risk that
some students will not be able to live in traditional College housing.
In past years, Director of Residential Life Myrt Westphal has eventually
found dorm rooms for all who want them. That task is getting harder as
enrollment increases—and whatever you may have heard about whether or
not enrollment is going up, the projected number of students in next year's
entering class is much larger than the number of students who will graduate
this spring.
Housing Committee's measures will help fix this year's problem. But they
are merely band-aids; the College needs to reexamine the housing situation
thoroughly and fully if it wants a permanent solution.

The

coffee bar is nice,

but...

It is great that the Kohlberg Coffee Bar was opened this week. How did we
survive at Swat without being able to see those oddly-shaped frosted plastic
lampshades on a daily basis. Well, at least they make you think twice of your
aesthetic appraisal of the art glass.
And those granite tables! They must be really serious about discouraging
people from moving furniture around.
And where would a college like Swarthmore be without that bastion of the
cigarette-smoking leftist intellectual, the coffee bar? It's amazing we've
survived for so long with only the Jumping Cow to quench our caffeine lusts
As far as coffee bars go, the food and drink offerings are quite good. Scones
seem to be a particularly popular item; they even made an appearance at
Sharpies' Breakfast Bar for dinner tonight. We note a distinct lack of hot
cocoa, however.
The coffee bar is great for students, but the area is also good for visting with
parents and guests. The chairs are comfortable and plentiful. The decor is
certainly impressive for a building designed mainly for academics.
Unfortunately, the prices are on the high side, and its hours of operation are
rather limited. Being Swatties, we are more likely to long for a coffee fix
sometime after dinner than at 9:00 a.m.
Part of the problem might be that the Coffee Bar is run by Dining Services.
We have the highest respect for Dining Services, but we think students would
drool over the chance to work at the Coffee Bar, and might even be willing to
work late at night.
We really realize that prices might drop and hours be extended as the bar
proves its popularity, but we wanted to put in our two cents. This is an editorial
column, after all.

Check out the Wister Garden.
If you walk from ML to campus, try turning off Harvard Avenue a little
early, just before you get to the ABC Boys House. Or, if you live on campus,
walk down the dirt road that goes out behind the swimming pool and the
football bleachers. On the Crum side of the road, about 30 feet before the
Straw Bale House (or 30 feet past the Straw Bale House, if you're coming
from Campus), there are a series of narrow paved paths leading off into the
Crum. This is the Wister Garden, named for the first curators of the Scott
Arboretum; they lived in the nearest house.
If you walk down any of these paths a mere 5 or 10 feet, you'll see that the
ground is carpeted with Snowdrops and Crocuses. The Wister Garden is the
first of the Scott Arboretum's gardens to burst into bloom each spring; the
flowers bloom every spring whether papers and problem sets are works of
genius or not, irregardless of labs that went poorly or lectures whose every
concept you grasped. Check out the Wister Garden. It's worth a salutation.

Solving Welfare the Objectivist Way: NINACOW!

There are people in need of blood.
Now, would you consider, as a solution to this problem, that the government make a law requiring that those

mandatory for those who earn money
to donate it to those who need it as

Jonathan Evans and Jessica Keith

Jonathan: Okay, Jessica. Run along. This
is men's talk.
Jessica: Now Jon, if you were James Bond
looking absolutely dashing in your tux and
rescuing me from the clutches of an evil
international villain, maybe I would listen.
But you're not. So shut up.
Jonathan: You know, there's just no better way of getting the testosterone flowing
than with a good James Bond flick. Sexism at
its best. After watching the movies this weekend, you' 11 wantto go
make a sacrifice to the PC God of
Swarthmore in the Crum. Jessica,
as the token female, why don't
you begin?
Jessica: Sure.For Swarthmore's
James Bond weekend, the movie
committee brings us "Goldfinger,"
an old Sean Connery Bond film
(the third ever), and "Goldeneye,"
the most recent, with new man
Pierce Brosnan. Now, I've got to
say that I used to be a major James
Bond fan in about seventh grade. I
dreamed about becoming a Bond
girl. Seriously. But I guess growing more mature and Swarthmoreized, my perspective has changed
somewhat.
Watching "Goldfinger" this
week, I found myself being offended at times. I mean, the lead
woman is named "Pussy Galore"
(subtle, huh) and lines like "Run
along. This is men's talk"? Jon
didn't pull that out of thin air. It
can become rather
tiresome.
So, if you go to see
"Goldfinger," be prepared to see some
sexism/racism. But if
you can deal with
that, taking into account that this is a
Bond film and that it
was made in 1964, it
can be fun. It's got all
the things you expect
in a Bond film: the
music, action, martinis, a cool car, beautiful women, an evil
villain with a scary henchman, etc.
The plot is this: the Bank of England
suspects millionaire Auric Goldfinger (German actor GerdFroebe) ofleading an international gold smuggling operation, and so the
British Secret Service sends Bond on the
case. He follows Goldfinger, gets in a bunch
of chases, gets attacked by the villain's hatwielding bodyguard, Oddjob (Harold Sakota),
rescues a few women, gets captured, meets
Goldfinger's pilot Pussy Galore (Honor
Blackman), uncovers the REAL scheme of
Goldfinger, then POW, a dramatic finish and
Bond saves the day, with the essential help of
Ms. Galore, with whom he becomes involved,
of course.
Random fact for this movie—this is the
first Bond film in which Desmond Llewelyn
plays gadget wizard Q, a wonderful part
which he still plays in "Goldeneye."
So this movie is classic Bond, like I said. It
might have been a little slow at first, but the
end is certainly exciting. And there are some
pretty funny situations, like when Goldfinger
has a laser slowly cutting through the gold
table Bond is tied to, slowly moving towards
acertain strategic part of the hero's body, and
Bond nervously says, "Do you want me to
talk?"and Goldfingerreplies, "No, Mr. Bond,
I want you to DIE!!!" The plot is contrived
and unrealistic, so be prepared to suspend
your disbelief.
Jonathan: And that, when it comes right
down to it, is whatBond is all about. Ultimate
fantasy. Anyway, my turn for Goldeneye?
Jessica: Yes, good idea, just talk about the
movie, okay?

efforts. Several organizations, including the Women's Voter Project and College
Dems, are hoping to not only increase the numberofregistered
voters on campus, but also to sponsor educational events in
order to inform students.
Ben Fritz '99, co-secretary of the College Democrats, explained, "College Dems wants to encourage students on campus to become politically involved and voting is the best way
to dothat. We believe having a party is the easiest way to do this
because students will be in a social and fun atmosphere. Also,
this is part of our attempt to make College Democrats more of
a presence on campus."

Also on Saturday night, the Alumni Gospel Choir will
present its 25th Anniversary Concert, in the Friends' Meeting

part of the Black Alumni Weekend, which will also highlight

Jonathan: Asking me not to talk about sex

is like asking me to hate movies, and being
that movies are my Iife...OKAY, "Goldeneye" (named after lan Fleming's mansion) is
the latestincarnation of Bond, and I'm going
to warn you right now...THE MUSIC'S NOT
THERE! The bastards took it out! This offended me personally when I saw it, so I felt
I should warn you.
"Mr. Bond, you are a chauvinistic dinosaur," says the new female M (Judi Dench).
This movie tries to become
Yes, that's
more socially aware, but how do
you make James Bond a positive
feminist flick? All the same stuff
is there (except the MUSIC),
though, with just a couple society-sensitive twists. Moneypenny
is still a flirtation, Bond is in a
tux, and can break the laws of
physics (as is obvious in the opening sequence). Pierce Brosnan
does an excellentjob as 80nd...0f
course, he was born for the part
(and apparently can never wear a
tux for any other roles, according
to his contract). Delivers some
good lines like, "No more foreplay!"
The only problem as a whole is
the general script. You can see
what they were trying to do with
this movie: combine the suaveness of Connery with the humor
of Moore and the violence of
Dal ton. This doesn't quite work.
It was too violent at times, too
ridiculous at others. It just gnawed
at me throughout.
The brief plot summary is this: there's
an evil force threatening the world by
taking control of the
Goldeneye satellite
defense system. Basically, the Goldeneye was a secret
weapon that was better than Star Wars
electromagnetic flux
with nuclear blast to
take out all electronics. Now does that
sound like Bond or what?
What made this movie endearing for me,
though, was the chase scene with the tank;
Bond's hair and outfit stay perfect, and he
pays no attention to the city, just to get the
girl. My brother and I have always wanted to
steal a tank like that...(sigh).
The cast in this movie was also excellent:
Joe Don Baker as Jack Wade, the new CIA
man, Sean Bean (whom you might remember
from "Patriot Games") as Alec Trevelyan (a
00 with Bond), and the Bond women Izabella
Scorupco and Famke Jahssen. And how one
of these ladies kills...if I gotta go, I could
think of worse ways.
Jessica: I always thought Pierce Brosnan
would be the perfect choice for 80nd... they
actually wanted him above Timothy Dalton
years ago, but he couldn't get out of his
Remington Steele contract.
Jonathan: Thanks go to Jessica this week
for providing the trivia tidbits.
Jessica: And did you know that Sean
Connery has only seen Goldfinger twice?
Nevertheless, according to his granddaughter, it's his favorite Bond movie. (I should be
researching my thesis; instead, I research
James Bond. Oh well.)
Jonathan: You know, I just have to say
this: these theme weekends are cute, but
going for the "GokT'en Bond flicks is a little
much. Just in case some of you were annoyed
with it, I just wanted to let you know you're
not the only one.
Jessica: And that's it for this week. So,

Coffee Bar!) and get ready for some action,

Presnell), will pony up for the ransom.
Then Jerry and the two crooks will split the
cash.
It all goes horribly awry when Carl and
Gaear, an unexpectedly feisty Jean bundled
in the backseat, botch their getaway. First
Gaear shoots a highway patrolmen. Then
he has to kill a couple of passing motorists.
By the time Carl and Gaear hole up in an
isolated cabin, the death toll is high and set
to rise. And Wade, mean-spirited as always, seems reluctant to pay the ransom,
even if it is his daughter. Which leaves

Jerry in a sticky and increasingly frenzied
position, caught between his tightwad father-in-law and a couple of borderline
psychotics.
At this point, Marge Gunderson (Frances
McDormand), Police Chief of rural
Brainerd, Minnesota (home of Paul
Bunyan) appears on the scene. Marge is
seven months pregnant, utterly unflappable,
and folksy as all hell. She and her husband,
Norm (John Carroll Lynch), who paints
ducks, are like a warm and fuzzy version of
American Gothic.
Nothing fazes Marge: not three dead
bodies scattered along her neighboring
stretch of highway; not an old high-school
friend (Steve Park) who still carries a torch
for her; not someone's leg sticking out of a
woodchipper; and certainly not twitchy
little Jerry Lundegaard. Marge just looks
around, drawls some homespun advice to
her enthralled deputies, and rounds up the
clues.
Marge is a wonderful character, quirky
and screwy and hilarious. With her flat
Minnesota drawl (hearing Marge say
"woodchipper" is worth the price of admission) and down-home charm, she's utterly endearing. This is a breakthrough role
for McDormand, a dependable supporting
actress who's never had a role this good

before. Her Marge is "Fargo's" heart, but
the Coens surround her with an astonishing
collection of misfits and losers.
William H. Macy is magnificently sleazy
as the scheming Jerry, whose ambition far
surpasses his limited brainpower. As he
sweats and squirms, Macy looks for all the
world like a particularly desperate Hummel
figure brought to life.
Steve Buscemi is up to his usual hysterical hoodlum schtick here, bouncing his rattat-tat dialogue off of the solid and utterly
impassive (not to mention genuinely frightening) Peter Stormare. Buscemi and
Stormare form a pitch-perfect pair ofdarkly
comic losers.
"Fargo" is next to impossible to pin
down. Pinballing from laidback laughs to
sudden and shockingly graphic violence, it
plays like a cross between GarrisonKeiler's
"Lake Woebegone" and "Red Rock West."
The Coens are, as always, playing mind
games. Time and time again, things that
just aren't funny (kidnapping, murder, the
aforementioned woodchipper) are played
for laughs and things that should be funny
have dark undertones. It's unsettling, but
fascinating.
And it helps to make "Fargo" a provocative and exhilarating experience, not to
mention the funniest movie yet this year.

Out and About

Outlet Shopping Proven to be Cheap and Easy
By

John Freeman

Nothing

in the Swarthmore fashion aesthetic could be as
sacrilegious and uncouth as the suit. Amongst ripped jeans
and thrift-shop wear, the prep stands out as square conformist
and the suit-wearing as corporate sell-out. Walking through the halls,
thepoor suitedsenior en route to interview walks naked with his greed
strapped like a fig leafaround his privates in pursuit of a job which
(gasp!) requires him to wear that modern day suit of armor—the
dark suit. And yet, if you talk to anyone, they'll tell you a suit is not
impressive, it's required.
If you haven't already made a quest to an outlet or accidentally
dropped $5OO on a department store or designer suit, now is the time
to make that rite of passage from collegiate to unemployed, from
sports jacket and slacks to SUIT. A suit which requires tailoring and
urges you to buy a tie. The suit which will carry along with it the token
folio with notepad, resume, paper, and pen.
Swarthmore men making this transition ought to look to local
outlets for bargain buys on designer suits before walking into the trap
of buying one with parents. Within a close drive, assuming you have
access to a car, are bargain suit buying locations in Franklin Mills and
of course, the Reading Outlet Stores.
Reading is by far the less attractive unless you really want a
Burberry suit (snotty English brand name) since it's a far drive, you
have to be in Reading ofall places, and there is often poor selection
at the men's apparel stores such as Polo and Perry Ellis.
A small outlet town called Franklin Mills, 30 minutes north of the
city, holds a greater variety of men's fashion and often cheaperprices.
If not for the fashion, come for the almost surreal experience of
walking through strategically-controlled shopping environments complete with periodic food stops, mood music coordinated to the stores
it surrounds, and 8' X 8' television screens playing recent music
videos. Exercise your critical faculties by deconstructing the advertising blitz aimed to fray your consumer guilt into submission.
Meandering through the maze of endless shops, approaching size
and scale of the fabled King of Prussia Mall, you'll run into outlet
gems like Nordstrom's Rack, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus,
and the most unassuming, yet treasure-filled place of all Syms.
The aforementioned stores will provide you with a patchy selection
of suits which range from the unknown tacky golf suit to the highprofile predatory finish of a double-breasted Hugo Boss pin stripe.
Nordstrom's Rack is probably the worst of all places since its
selection will vary from excellent to downright poor. Neiman Marcus
has a good variety of unassuming gray suits, as well as a number of
package deals which make you look not unlike a J.C. Penny model,
all around the range of $3OO.
Saks is the high end of this shopping spectrum with its array of
Burberry, Hugo Boss, and other brand name suits. If you wantto play
ihe risky mix and match game with jackets and slacks, Saks has lots
of stylishly cut blazers for around $5O-$ 100. Their suits range from
about $3OO up to $5OO but are sprinkled with a few $2OO dollar suits
that can be jackpot city for some lucky shopper.
—

Finally, Syms, a warehouse of stuff so cheap you wonder if it is
stolen. The place has wall-to-wall suits, some as cheap as $ll5 by
Guy Laroche, and many name brands well under $3OO in attractive if
not trendy styles. The place is so big that help may not find you until
you're buried in a choice between four or five suits. There are plenty
of designer ties to choose from, marked down from $lOO to $3O.
I still feel somewhat guilty for walking out with a Pierre Cardin suit
and two Auntie Anne pretzels for under $l7O in less than 2 hours.
Shopping for something as symbolically important as a suit seems
like it ought to take all day, if not multiple trips. Don't fall into this
trap. The fact that you might spend a whole lot less for that required
suit ought to be just reward for your travels.

know this; as far as they're concerned, I'm
only 20. It was also here when my siblings
finally admitted to me that my mother and
father and the rest of the family, for that
matter, were home in Vietnam. I cried and
cried, wanting so badly to see everyone,
especially my mother.
I was never to see the rest of my family
ever again. We were going to America and
they couldn't come along because we didn't
have enough money to pay passage for all
fifteen members of our family.
We spent about a year living on an island
with other refugees before we were admitted to the States. My sister Mai, the one who
was supposed to be here in America, is
married with four kids, while I'm here at
Swarthmore. If I were in Vietnam, I
would' ve been married, too, probably with
some kids of my own. But with some strange
twist of fate, I'm here experiencing the
American life instead.
We do keep in touch with our family back
home in Vietnam. We write, call, and send
money and gifts. My older siblings have
been back several times, but I have not. I
intend to visit my family in Vietnam after I
graduate; until now, my siblings had been
afraid it might be too traumatic an experience for me. It will be the first time I have
seen my parents in sixteen years.

A Personal Struggle
Reconciling Christianity
with Asian History
By Thomas Ta

I

remember reading a post on swat.talk,
of all places, which asserted that an
Asian would most likely convert to Christianity to assimilate more thoroughly into
Western culture and follow the "American
Dream," which was defined by making
money. Though insulting to Christians of
Asian descent, this theory does raise an
interesting point about Asian identity and
Christianity. Why would so many Asians
choose a religion that has been so interwoven withcolonialism and suffering in Asia?
One's identity should not be centered
around one'srace or ethnicity. This is not to
say that race or ethnicity play no part in
defining that identity. To believe in the
former would be narrow-mindedness; to
believe in the latter would be naive. To the
extent that an identity is constructed within
a historical context and tradition, race and
ethnicity must be taken into account.
My thinking can be characterized as predominately Western. Plato has more significance to me than, for example, Lao-Tze.
Christianity has always been a part of my
identity, ifnot in my general outlook on life,
then at least in the back of my mind. Yet, I
cannot ignore that my identity is also defined by the fact that others see me as Asian.
My mother is devoutly Roman Catholic;
most of her childhood was spent in a convent in Vietnam. When we visit our relatives in France, she always makes it a point
to go on a pilgrimage to the village of
Lourdes where, in 1858, Bernadette
Soubirous had a vision of the Virgin Mary.
To her, there is no discrepancy in being
Vietnamese and being Roman Catholic.

I was raised and baptized Lutheran and
have completed my three years of Catechism. Yet it is difficult for me to share my
mother's feelings for the Church. I have
always felt a sense of hypocrisy in being
Asian and a member of theChristian Church.
When thinking of the Church and its
relation with Vietnam, one cannot help but
think of the legacy of French colonialism
which ended less than two generations ago.
Time and time again, the Church has either
supported colonial expansion outright or
turnedablind eye to imperialistic atrocities.
Historically, Christianity has justified colonialism in Asia by portraying its people as
heathens. Implicit in this logic was the belief that Asians were somehow inferior and
childlike and needed the help of the West in
order to "see the Light." One cannot ignore
this strain ofracism whose legacy is still felt
now, echoed by such contemporary Christian leaders as Pat Robertson.
Yet the Church has either been unapologetic about its history or has attempted to
brush its history under the proverbial rug. I
find that many Christians of Asian decent
are apologists for the Church. Perhaps they
feel that their belief in Christianity forces
them to overlook thehorrors that the Church
has committed historically. Maybe they
believe that the current Church can somehow separate itself from its history and the
influence of its tradition. I find that doing
either would be a terrible mistake.
The ChristianChurch still harbors condescension and intolerance towards people of
other beliefs. Although this attitude has
been mentionedbefore when talking about
the colonialist mentality, it needs to be
addressed briefly in a post-colonial light.
Again, I will draw from the history ofVietnam, which during the period prior to the
war was governed by a Roman Catholic
minority that was intolerant ofthe Buddhist
majority. One of the most horrific and haunting images from history is the photograph
taken by Malcolm Browne '52 of the Buddhist monk Thich Quang Due's self-immolation in protest of the oppressive Roman
Catholic government. How can anyone even
attempt to turn his back to this history? I
would argue that belief in Christianity does
not imply that disrespect of other beliefs,
yet these feelings are very much part of the
traditionand history ofChristianity in Asia.
One could easily ask, "Why remain a
Christian?" if all the above is true, but this
would show a lack of understanding of what
it means to have faith and belief. It was not
my intention when writing this article to
indict all of Christianity, nor was it my
intention to ignore the numerous positive
changes it has brought to society. Throughout history, many denominationshave protested against society's inequalities and injustices. The Quaker tradition, for example,
has a long history of struggling for progressive change. Many other examples abound.
Religion and faith are powerful forces that
can bring about positive change into many
lives. But unfortunately, they have also
brought about much pain.
Reconciling my Asian identity with my
belief in Christianity does not mean attempting to reconcile the fact that Christianity is a Western religion. It means attempting to come to terms with a religion
that has represented colonialism and suffering for so many Asians and that continues to
preach down to them. It is misguided to
reject Christianity because ofits past. However, until the Church and its leaders display the moral integrity they so often espouseand acknowledge the Church's darker
legacy, for many people Christianity will
remain a symbol of oppression.

No Longer the Majority;
Asian Finds Swarthmore
Less Diverse Than Home
By Jimmy

Chan

Generally

speaking, students who
come to this school find the student
body to exhibit a vast racial diversity. However, there are those that would
disagree with this statement. Students who
come from primarily Caucasian communities may be in awe when they see the number of minorities attending Swarthmore.
Many of these students elected to attend
Swarthmore on the basis of the diverse
student population they perceived in the
nifty little guide book the Admissions Office distributed to these perspective recruits.
However, diversity is relative. I for one,
experienced a decrease in the magnitude of
diversity as I made my transition from high
school to college. As an Asian American
living in Elmhurst, New York (which it is
predominantly Asian and Latino), coming
to Swarthmore College was in essence a
"reverse" culture shock.
When I first stepped on campus as a
freshman, I was astounded with the multitude ofCaucasians. I was not brought up in
a Caucasian-dominatedenvironment. Coming from a public high school where Caucasians were a minority and "minorities" were
the majority, this was definitely a startling
turnabout in racial composition.
For the first couple of weeks as a freshman, I conversed almost exclusively with
minority students and I was definitely apprehensive to associate with white students
in general. Because there were relatively
few personal encounters with whites back
in Elmhurst, I had an unwarranted fear of
interaction with the white student body of
Swarthmore. I constantly thought to myself, "What do these people think of me
since I am an Asian American?" or "Am I
ever going to fit into the social mode as an
Asian American student at Swarthmore?"
It was especially an eerie experience last
year when my RA gathered my hall into his
room during the first week of classes to
have us formally introduce ourselves. Left
and right, I saw so many people who had
blonde hairand blue eyes and all these other
facial and bodily features that still seem
exotic and foreign to me. I, myself, possess
the prototype of pitch black hair and dark
eyes that scream out "Asian" and made me
distinctively different from the rest of the
people in the room.
For a while, I dissociated myself from my
hallmates because I felt that I did not belong
with them in their social sphere. However,
soon the fear began to subside as I made
adjustments to my new environment. My
assimilation process came about slowly,
but progressively, and eventually I became
comfortable enough to parley with people
without being overly-conscious about the
"whiteness" of the person that I was speaking to (props go to my former hallmates of
Willets first South for making it possible).
Do I regret coming here knowing that
there are other institutions of higher learning with more diversity? As a sophomore, I
would say no because I have made many
friends whom I cannot picture leaving behind. However, I do feel that if the school is
going to pride itself in diversity, it should
recruit more Asian American students and
other minorities. Many of my friends from
high school (there was about a fifty percent
Asian population there) asked me, "Why in
the world are you going to Swarthmore? Do

Asians exist there?"
Well, obviously Asians do, but they do
have a point. Students who come from large
urban communities would especially be disappointed with the minority population at
Swarthmore. I am hoping that Swarthmore
will further increase itsenrollment forAsian
Americans and otherminorities so that others like me will not have to be subjected to
that feeling of uneasiness I experienced.

Race and Nationality

Make Belonging Difficult
in Both U.S. and Vietnam
By Amy

Mai Hope

When

I was younger, I believed my
brother had dropped me on my
face. I had never seen anyone
with my facial structure before. More specifically, I had never seen anyone with my
nose.
As a child of Asian descent living in an
all-white community, I was an anomaly, but
I was loved and accepted. My identity as a
human being was based on everything except my physical appearance; I belonged
despite my different nose.
Visiting Vietnam, the country ofmy birth,
allowed me to view myself in a different
light. There I belonged; I was the orphan
who had been taken away from Vietnam
and had returned to learn about my culture,
my country, and my language.
"Why was this my country?" I asked
myself this question over and over. Because
I was born here; because I looked like those
around me? We shared a nose. The Vietnamese have a saying, "One drop of shared
blood is worth more than all the water in the
seven seas." I shared blood.
Frequently, locals would tell me, "You
look like Vietnamese girl." Once my new
Vietnamese friends fixed my hair like a
Vietnamese girl, with a braid down my
back, a style I had worn as a child. Friends
wanted to know if I wanted a Vietnamese
husband and most importantly how I could
have grown up and survived isolated from
the Vietnamese community for twenty years.
Many could not understand how I could
have survived without pho, a traditional
meal, without speaking Vietnamese, and
without ever wearing an aoi dai, the native
dress. Instead I ate chicken soup, spoke
English, and wore jeans.
Many Vietnamese kept telling me, "This
is your culture, this is your heritage." What
I saw instead was a social paradigm totally
alien to me. I was like any other student
traveling abroad into a foreign country,
except I looked like the natives and was
expected the learn the language and customs faster than my classmates.
Most importantly, I was to love the country, my motherland. I do love Vietnam, but
the language has not come easily and I
committed my fair share of cultural mistakes while abroad.
Trying to relate to Vietnam was difficult
for me. I arrived with the notion that being
Vietnamese and having been born in Vietnam would mean something monumental to
me, but I never quite defined whatit should
mean or how it would fit into my identity.
I would like to say it was nice, belonging
in a community where I looked like those
around me. But I have yet to decide what
being Vietnamese means to me. I have eaten
pho and own an aoi dao, but there is more
for me to learn before I feel comfortable
laying claim to the Vietnamese culture. It
was a novelty to see my nose on others.

Swarthmore History

When Chinese Naval Officers Studied English Here at Swat
By

In

Elizabeth Weber

the fall of 1943, life at Swarthmore was much as it had
been before World War II began. Classes, clubs, social
events, and talk of politics and social action continued
unabated. But the Phoenix contained advertisements for
Victory Bonds, as well as a column of news from students
who had interrupted their studies to join the armed forces or
organized conscientious objector work. Two-thirds of the
male students on campus were enlisted in the Navy's V-12
program, and forty-nine Chinese Naval officers arrived on
campus to study English.
The officers came from all parts of China, though most
were graduates of the Chinese Naval Academy. They spent
several months studying English at Swarthmore, before half
departed for MIT to study shipbuilding and half departed for
the Naval Academy to study Naval Administration—these
officers were to form the backbone ofChina's post-war Navy.
WhenCommander Henry T. Jarrell of the U.S. Navy came
to take charge of the unit in December, he explained to the
Phoenix that "a number of institutions were thoroughly
satisfactory as to basic qualifications —such as location near
a Navy yard and not too far from Washington, small enough
size for individual attention; and the previous and contemporaneous presence of another Naval unit. The competition of
the privilege of having the Chinese was quite keen, and in the
end Swarthmore College was chosen because of its friendliness."
Most of the officers had already been on active duty—
China had been at war with Japan since the early thirties. A
November Phoenix article told ofLiu Fu, "who wears the
Distinguished Service Medal of China. It was he who swam

out, off the shore ofShanghai, with land mines to sink several
Japanese ships, one of them a flagship. One particularly
narrow escape he told ofwas when he was in a Shanghai hotel
room on a 'special mission'. Although the room was surrounded by Japs, and there were several hiding in the room's
closets, Liu escaped to safety through one ofthe windows....
Any one of the Chinese could tell you equally exciting
personal incidents."
At Swarthmore, they woke in Wharton at six to exercise
alongside the v-12 unit before breakfast. They studied English from breakfast until eleven, drilled until noon, took
physical fitness alongside Swarthmore students from one to
two, and then continued studying English until four. The
Phoenix reported, "the officers are especially fond ofAmerican football games, dancing, and it is rumored that they even
like Swarthmore food!"
On Friday, January 7, they presented a series of comical
skits they had written in Bond: "First appeared grave whitebearded admirals, reminiscing about the happy days when
they were students at Swarthmore. Their uniform sleeves
were ringed with rows and rows of gold braid, but one of them
still cherished in his pocket the bits of pink ribbon and strange
paraphernalia he acquired when he thought to buy mens'
garters in the local five and dimeand got the wrong gender by
mistake."
The officers participated in a number of goodwill events,
including appearing at Philadelphia area conferences and
playing basketball against a team from Philadelphia Navy
Recruiting. By May, they were so much a part of Swarthmore
life that the annual May Day Formal was given in their honor.
The Officers participated in the 1944 commencement exercises, receiving certificates of English training completion.

Need We Stand for the Flag?

week, however, it wasn't AbdulRauf s talent or disabilities that made

Last week while the majority of
the campus was somewhere else enjoying a vacation from this insanity
that is Swarthmore, I was here. The
slowed-down pace allowed me to indulge in some of the luxuries that I
normally can't enjoy: reading the
newspaper and wandering over to
511 Harvard Ave. to watch a little
ESPN. Among the various sports stories of last week, one stood out. It
wasn't the NCAA tournament, the
NIT, megabucks free-agent signings
in the NFL, or the Rangers-Kings
trade, but instead it centered on Denver Nuggets guard MahmoudAbdulRauf.
Abdul-Rauf, formerly known as
Chris Jackson while at LSU and during his first few years in the NBA, is
a very talented player on an otherwise mediocre team. Aside from his
name change and his foul shooting,
Abdul-Rauf is best known for his
bouts with Tourette's Syndrome,
which sometimes render him incapable of tying his own shoes. This
,

headlines.
Last week, it came to NBA Commissioner DavidStern' s attention that
Abdul-Rauf refuses to stand during
the playing of the national anthem.
While the NBA justbecame aware of
this last week, Abdul-Rauf has been
pulling this routine all season, sitting
on the bench or waiting in the locker
room . Abdul-Rauf claims that his
religious beliefs as a Muslim come
before honoring any country, and that
the American flag is a symbol "of
oppression, of tyranny." The NBA
decided to suspend Abdul-Rauf indefinitely. Abdul-Rauf at first said
that he wouldn't yield and would
contemplate retirement, but then

backed down.
Abdul-Rauf s refusal to stand for
the national anthem must be sweet

The men's and women's ultimate
teams spent spring break

traveling

through Florida and the South, playing in two weekend tournaments and
scrimmaging along the way.
The teams spent the first weekend
in Gainesville, Florida, which was
weathering frigid temperatures and
heavy rainfall from the edge of a
tropical storm. The conditions made
for sloppy playing in the annual
Frostbreaker tournament there, hosted
at the University of Florida.
TheEarthworms fared well against
the competition, which included regional club teams and college squads
from the Northeast. The
'Worms defeatedall of their
college opponents, an auspicious sign for the season,
while two of their three
losses to club teams came
by a mere two-point mar-

nation (college Ultimate rankings
cross Division I-111 lines, so ranking
represents a team's standing in the
country against all other schools).
"It was a little frustrating, but we
played well," said co-captain Lena
Loewenthal '97, "and I think the team
really gained the respect of its opponents. Most importantly, all of the
individual members really contributed."
The Warmothers faced a tough
Sunday battle in the wind, losing by a
point in a time-capped game to a
strong University ofWisconsin team.
Swarthmore played a gritty upwind

gin.
"We played really intense," said co-captain
Robin Mandel '97 "everyone stepped up against the
college teams, and we
proved we can beat the teams
that will matter for us later
in the season."
The most exciting contest
came on the second day
against Harvard, a skilled
but streaky team that has at
times given fits to Northeast
Regional opponents. The
field was blasted by gusting
winds, forcing a tight, zonestrategy
game that favored
Swarthmore's patient, pressuring
style.
"We justplayed a monster zone,"
commented David Sacker '97. "We
kept switching it up... It gave them
too much to deal with, and they
couldn't score consistently."
The Warmothers likewise played
well throughout the tournament but
failed to topple any opponents
which, among others, included the
club team that finished second in the
tournament and UNC Wilmington,

up to Tallahasse, where the real
Florida finally began to peek over the
top of the thermometer. The teams
took the opportunity to scrimmage
Florida State University, which features powerful men's and women's

squads.
On Friday, the teams started on the
return north, stopping in Columbia,
South Carolina on the way for the
annual Saint Patrick's Day tournament, which also featured a mix of
club and college competition.
In the tournament, the Warmothers,
while again unable to defeat their
opponents, demonstrated strong zone
play and a tight defense
that challenged their
competition's ability to
score. Especially impressive was their showing
against 16th ranked Yale,
in whichthe'Mothers consistently frustrated their
opponents' disc movement, while keeping the
contest close with effective passing.
"The Yale game was
especially good for us,"
commented co-captain
Erica Baumgartner '9B,
"we really played well as
a team and worked the
disc."
The Earthworms were
able to record two victo-

Knudson '97. But late in the game,
their opponents were able to push the
disc against theS warthmore goal line
with wild but effective long passing,
and they took advantage of the opportunities to score.
After the tournament and a cheery
night in which the players were
flooded out of their tents, the teams
traveled south, hoping for warmer,

The NBA, like
every other professional league
in this country,
requires athletes
to stand and
show some kind
ofrespect during .
the playing of
the American and Canadian national
anthems. It doesn't ask that these
players stand and profess blind, unquestioning allegiance to the United
States or Canada, it simply asks for a
measure of respect.
Though Abdul-Rauf has decided
to stand for the national anthem, who
is to say he won't pull this stunt
again? If he does, Mr. Abdul-Rauf
has several choices.
He could stand during the national
anthem like every other player in the
NBA, Muslim or non-Muslim. If you
expect to play in the NBA, you had
better play by their rules. Hakeem
Olajuwon, who happens to be a Muslim, said last week that part of being
a good Muslim is being a good citizen. I suspect that being a good citizen means following the rules.
He could choose to retire, and if he
does, there are two things he could

tyranny to him, why doesn't he sim-

proved too much for the opposition,
while imaginative play calling and

counter Swarthmore's combination
of aggressive deep threats and grinding goal line scoring.

teams a chance to travel to College

On the court, the most effective
defense thus far was played by Kingdom Protista. No, it's not Swarthmore's new mascot, but a flu virus
that struck two premier players,
Utah's Keith Van Home and Wake

Duncan as well as the entire UCLA

later found an influenza-tainted syringe in Princeton coach Pete Carrill' s

Women's softball is back! The
training over break proved fruitful
for the mighty Garnet as they opened
their season with an exciting win
over Neumann College of Aston, PA
on Monday here at Swat. But first, it
is necessary to recount the adventures of our intrepid sluggers. Freezing and bleary-eyed, they boarded a
plane last Saturday morning for
Florida only to have a cold and rainy
Sunshine State welcoming them.
Though they battled through the rain
to practice on Sunday, Monday's torrential rains kept them indoors and
itching to get a taste of the action.
Then the sun came upand dried up all
the rain.
Finally, on Tuesday afternoon, the
itsy bitsy Swat team faced the first of
four rough and tough schools also
staying in Vinnie's Temple to the
Ball and Bat otherwise known as the
Days Inn, Ft. Pierce. Despite the surprise of live pitching and the formidable opponents, Swat softball put
up a good fight against such schools
as Ripon of Wisconsin, Indian River
Community College, and the
homegirls from Rutgers-Newark.
Unfortunately, 4 days, 7 games,
and many trips to Perkins later, they
were not able to pull out a win, but
can indeed claim the honor of being
the only team to bring books to the
pool. Highlights of the trip include
some interesting injuries for Mollie
Davis '96 and Dana Lehman '9B, a
killer Mexican feast at Enrico's, a
nasty air hockey tournament at Ama-

zon Amusements, the evening of
Trivial Pursuit and Mozart, and the
life-changing discovery of Ron Jon
SurfShop by the coaches. Returning
well-rested, tanned, and fully laden
withthe oh-so relevant stories ofMelissaMorrell '99, Swat softball gained
invaluable game experience as well
as real sense of teamwork.
They got a chance to show off this
new experience to a throng of fans
(thank you!) Monday afternoon in
their victorious face-off against
Neumann. Exploding offensively,
they scored 4 runs in the first inning
and continued to play tight defense,
withLehman pitching an impressive
8 strikeouts. While they never quite
regained that initial offensive momentum, consistent defensive performance kept Swat on top of the
game. The range and rocket arm of
freshman Jennifer Vander Veer at
shortstop and the dependable glove
of Apryl Dunning '99 behind the plate
were important in getting outs and
stopping any scoring drive they attempted. With a final score of 5-2,
Swat Softball left the field looking
ahead and seeing many more victories in store.
While this vision was delayed by a
rained out game on Wednesday
against Cabrini College, they travel
tomorrow to Drew University for a
doubleheader in the great state of
New Jersey. Come and watch on
Tuesday, March 26th for their first
conference matchup against Washington College. The winning tradition starts now!

however, the team has practiced every day this week. With the level of
play starting out as high as it did in
the scrimmage, fans can expect to see
some good competitive rugby on Saturday.
It was only four months ago that
the Swarthmore team ended their fall
season with a somewhat disappointing gameagainst therival Bry nMawr/
Haverford team. The A side tied five
to five and the B side lost. Now
Swarthmore is pumped up to take
them on.
However a lot can change in four
months, even in just a month.
Swarthmore has a lot of excellent
returning players and several new
players who are learning very fast.
Hard practice, good skills, and of
course the home field advantage
should all work in Swarthmore's favor when they play Bryn Mawr/
Haverford this Saturday at 10:00 a:m.
(A side) and noon (B side) on the Du

Men's Track Road Trip Successful
Nevin Katz

The men's track team more than
held their own against Division 1
athletes last weekend. The team faced
competition from the University of
Southern Florida, the University of
Northern Florida, the University of
Central Florida, Florida International
University and the University of Miami. While the talent of these teams
was more than obvious, this was more
balanced in most cases by the smarts,
heartand determination ofthe SWAT
sprinters.
As Sprint Captain Mike Turner' 96
said, "It feels good to pull through
when you're the underdog. The school
we go to is well known for its academics but not it's athletics—it's just
nice to show those guys what we can
do."
In the middle distance events, Phil
Jones '99 and NevinKatz '99 scraped
a good five seconds off of each of
their 1500 times, coming across at
4:14 and 4:30. Close on their heels
was Noah Daniels '9B.
Wyn Strodtbeck '9B and Gordon
Roble '99 stuck their noses into the
lead pack of a blistering 800-meter
run, in which the second half of the
race became a test of sheer stamina.
Gutting it out all the way, Strodtbeck

came across in 2:00, withRoble right
on his shoulder at 2:01. Tim Sibley
'9B got his face in the race as well in
the following section, capturing a

solid 2:06.

In the 200m, Turner showedFlorida
exactly what he can do. He not only
qualified for the final but also went
on to take second place overall in the
meet in a nationals-pace time of 22
seconds flat. GioviGrasso-Knight'9B
also busted out, running 24 low, a full
second quicker than his best last season. The 200 meters was even more
memorable for Swarthmore as it featured the year's first appearance of
"Big" Chris Folwer '97. Running
under an assumed name to avoid publicity, he ran an impressive race in the
very low 25 second range, just a few
strides in front of a trash talking Kelly
Hauser '99.
In the 100m, all three Swarthmore
athletes qualified for the final despite

sub-optimum performances. The
qualifying heats were basically a
battle of wills, with six athletes being
disqualified for false-starting. GrassoKnight,, Chris Hourigan '96 and
Hauser took third, fourth and fifth
places respectively with times somewhere in the high 11- to low 12second range.
The 400 meter hurdles race was the

Women's Lacrosse Wins
By

Jennifer Z. Chen

Before Tuesday' s game against the
College ofNotre Dameof Maryland,
Coach Borbee sent an e-mail message to herplayers thatsaid: "If you're
headed in the right direction, each
step, no matter how small, is getting
closer to your goal." On Tuesday,
after weeks of practice, the women's
lacrosse team finally got to test their
mettle and played in their first game
of the season. That game in the rain
ended with a
Swarthmore win (76) but with 10minutes remaining on
the clock as a result
of the NCAA regulation against playing in the presence
of lightning.
Last week there
was a different scenario. The varsity
team headed down
to Sea Pines Plantation on Hilton Head,
S.C. for spring break, where the
weather was far from the wet and
muddy conditions of the game on
Tuesday. Players had two practices
each day, each lasting about two and
a half hours. They scrimmaged against
SUNY Cortland, Ohio Wesleyan
University and conference rival
Gettysburg College; no score was
kept. That trip provided the opportunity for players to compete against
other schools in mock-game settings
and for both players and coaches to
experiment with new skills and strategies.
Before the game on Tuesday, Coach
Borbee set four goals for the team to
accomplish in every game this season: dominating ground balls, winning draws (faceoffs), banking in on
more shots, and improving blocks
and interceptions. "We had flashes of

how we would always want to play,"
said Lia Ernst '97. "Things will get
ironed out. We have the talent to be
really, really good but we just have to
come together."
Swarthmore dominated CNDM in
the number of ground balls (54) and
the number of blocks and interceptions (5). However, their draw control was only 6 out of 15 faceoffs and
they scored only 7 out of 27 shots on
goal. The goals came from Betsy
Rosenbaum '9B, Lara Ewens '96 (4
goals and 1 assist), and K.
Osburne '97 (1
goal and 1 assist),
Jen Hagen '99
had an assist. The
unfamiliarity of
playing as a unit
led to the team's
inability to capitalize on its numerous scoring
opportunities.
Nerves also
contributed to the
close outcome of the game.Lia Ernst,
whoreturned to her position as attack
wing after missing last season because of knee surgery, admitted that
she Was more nervous than she should
have been. This anxiety caused her to
be ".. .more tentative"and placed more
pressure on herself to have a good
first game. Despite that fact, Ernst
had a goal and an assist in the game.
This year, with better stick control
and athleticism, the team has the capability to move in a fast passing
game, make better plays and force
the other team out of their game.
After their first game of the season,
the women's lacrosse team has a
clearer vision of their capabilities as
a team and more familiarity witheach
other, and is ready to take on Colorado College on Thursday and
Lynchburg College on Sunday.

Women's Tennis Falls
By Hilary
and

Gehlbach

Michelle Martinez

Though the week in Hilton Head,
South Carolina got off to a chilly
start, the women's tennis team showed
strong potential as the weather
warmed up. The season opener on
Sunday at 8 am against Mary Washington College left the Garnet Tide
wishing they'd remembered their
gloves, as they succumbed to the traditional powerhouse 9-0 with many
frozen fingers.
The women's next encounter
against the well-nourished women of
the University of Wisconsin at Eau
Claire gave testimony to the team's
depth this year, despite the final loss
8-1. The lone win of the evening
came from second doubles team Rani
Shankar '9B and Neena Shenai '9B,
who battled impressively to defeat
their opponents 8-6 in the pro-set.
Playing at #4 singles, Shenai also
proved her swatting strength in an
exhausting match, though her opponent eventually came out ahead.
Swarthmore's final two matches
against Methodist and Division I
Valparaiso demonstrated the team's
continued tenacity, though the final
team score in both cases was 4-5.

Playing at #1 doubles against Methodist, Michelle Martinez '97 and
Hilary Gehlbach'96 fought back from
behind to come out with a win, while
Nga Lai '97 and Aarti Iyer '99 posted
a win at #3 doubles. Shankar and
Shenai were singles winners against
Methodist, playing at #3 and #4, respectively.
In doubles action against
Valparaiso, Martinez and Gehlbach
again recovered from a slow start to
pull out a win, with Shankar and
Shenai capturing the #2 doubles point
for the Garnet Tide. Playing at #2
singles against Valparaiso, Gehlbach
overcame her traditional HiltonHead
singles losing streak with a triumph
in a third set tiebreaker, with a final
score of3-6,6-4,7-6 (7-4). Lai posted
a win at #6 singles when her opponent forfeited due to an injury.
With their return to sunny state of
Pennsylvania, the Garnetwomen will
now look to continue their improving
play as they host their first two home
matches on Tuesday, March 26th, at
3:00 p.m. against Washington College, and on Thursday, March 28th,
at 3:00 p.m. against Western Maryland. Both matches will be played on
the Wharton courts, so stop by and
support the team!

first outing of the year
for "wrecking crew",
as Swarthmore hurdlers are known. Mason "Tootulls" Tootell
'99 (56 sees), Eric
Pakurar '97 (57 sees)
and Al Molnar' 97 (61
sees) all ran well and
shouldbe a maj or threat
at Conferences this
year. Reuben Canada
'99 ran the 110
m
hurdles for the first
time this season and will be looking
to score big in upcoming meets.
The real news of the meet, however, was therelays. The 4x 100-meter
relay team of Tootell, Turner, Sam
Paschel '96 and Canada blasted a
very impressive early season time of
43.7 seconds for the quarter mile.
This time should drop even further
with the recoveries of the injured
Brian Baird '99 and Walid Gellad

'97.
The 4x400-meter race was the highlight of the meet. Run under the light
at midnight, the team ran 3 minutes

and

23 seconds, the fastest time in recent
memory. The relay was powered by a
unbelievable 49.6 leadoff leg by
Turner and brought home by low 5051 second legs by Tootell, Canada
and Pakurar. The sight of a
S warthmore College team beating the
4x400m squad from the University
of Miami, under the lights, is an image that will stick with all who saw it
for a very long time to come. The
4x400 squad, and the whole team for
that matter, will surely be a dominant
force in this year's dual meet schedule and a huge threat in both Conference and Penn relays action.

Men's Tennis Loses
Matches to Strong Foes
By Greg Emkey

On the Tuesday of Spring Break,
the men's tennis team headed south
in search of warmer weather and a
couple of wins. They found the
warmer weather; the wins, on the
other hand, eluded them. This, their
first road trip of the spring season,
was scheduled to stop in North Carolina at Davidson and Elon Colleges.
Their first match, after a relaxing
evening in Lynchburg, Va., was
against Davidson College, a strong
Division 1 team. Davidson proved to
be too much for the Garnet to handle,
beating them 7-0. Swarthmore may
have lost, but they were certainly not
out-classed. All six singles matches
were close, and could easily have
gone either way. The singles lineup
consisted of co-captains Barry Mook
'96 and George Khalaf '96 at 1 and 2
respectively, Ed Ernst '9B at 3, Roger
Werner '9B at 4, Greg Emkey '99 at
5, and Nick Slimack '99 at 6.
After a respectable showing at
Davidson, Swarthmore had to suck it
up and head to Elon, where they took
on the Division II nationally ranked
men's tennis team. Elon consisted
largely of international players, primarily from Sweden. The Garnet
didn't let this intimidate them as they
took the court. In the doubles, the
dynamic duo of Emkey and Steve
Richards '99 defeated a pair of
Swedes 8-6 at third doubles. In order
to capture the doubles point, 2 of the
3 doubles must be won. The other
doubles teams, with Mook and
Werner at 1,and Ernstand Slimack at
2, played close matches, but couldn't

pull out a win. At the top 4 singles,
consisting of Mook, Khalaf, Ernst
and Werner, the Elon opponents were
able to win, but not without a battle.
Each match was close, and once again,
could have gone either way. Slimack
and John Derdarian '97, at 5 and 6
respectively, were able to pull out
victories for the Garnet, making the
final score 5-2.
The trip was a success for Swat. As
co-captain Mook said, "I was very
pleased with these matches. Compared to our matches with Davidson
in previous years, we did much better
thisyear, where each and every match
could have gone our way. I am very
excited about our chances of doing
well in Division III."
Feeling good about their performance over Spring Break, the men's
tennis team is now ready to face the
remainder of the season, beginning
with another trip down South this
weekend to Atlanta where they will
take on Division 111 powers
Kalamazoo and Emory.

Twenty-two hours on a bus. 500
miles and two Rambo movies later
the women's track team straggled off
the big Johnson into Tampa sunshine
with cramped muscles, plunging into
the spring break smorgasbord offun.
Passing the suntan lotion with Olympic-caliber baton-hand-off skill, the
team slicked down poolside under
the watchful gaze of the home-run
mindedGeorge Masonbaseball team.
Warming-up for the evening workout consisted of gentle simmering in
frothy hot tub waters.
Although the hot tub can suck the
water out of an athlete faster than
Sam Paschel '96 can pick up a frisky
golf pro, the team made a special
effort to keep themselves happy and
hydrated while attempting to vogue
with the grace and elegance of Eric
Pakurar'97 (how do you do it, Eric?).

only: to run. Hard. And fast. With

Like a herd of crazed lemmings,
the women's team swarmed with
maniacal intensity around the Special Olympic track of University of
Southern Florida (USF), whose decrepit track had more flakes than a
bowl of raisin bran. Morning and
afternoon the sprinters and throwers
rode over with Jim-bo while insane
distance runners donned their Nikes
and scampered through traffic to reach
the Great Red Oval.
A morning of rain banished the

The Garnet Tide baseball team returned fromFloridalast weekend with
tans and renewed confidencefor what
they believe will be an exciting and
successful season.
The Florida excursion was not all
fun and games, however. The team
arrived in Cocoa looking to play baseball and get better everyday, and that's
just what they did.
The GarnetTide posted a 2-3 record
in the SunshineState. While the team
would have liked a .500 or better
record, the signs were encouraging.
"The first couple games we didn't
come through with the clutch hits or
the big defensive plays," said pitcher/
outfielderPat Straub '97, who is hitting a lofty .400 with 5 R. 8.1, so far
this season. "By the end of the week,
you could see a big difference in our
level of play."
The Tide opened the season March
12 against West Liberty. Chuck
Hudson '96 pitched four innings of 1
hit, shutout ball. West Liberty hung a
four spot on reliever Dave Giles '9B
in the sixth inning, and the Garnet
Tide offense couldn't muster enough
to win as they succumbed 5-3.
The next day against FDU-Madison, the combined pitching of Sam
Voolich '96, Ben Sousa '9B, and Jeremy Bonder '97 held the Jersey Devils to 3 hits, but it took run scoring
singles by Andy Clayton '96 and
Craig Rodner '96 (9 stolen bases) to
produce a 6-4 victory. The Garnet

Tide was unable to follow up on this
momentum as Susquehana's ace
mowed the GarnetTide down, scattering three hits and striking out eight
as the Tide fell 5-1.
Against Mount Vernon, the offense
showed some signs of life, sprinting
out to a 5-2 lead for starter Voolich,
who gave way to Pat Straub '96. As
the offense faltered in the latter innings, so did the pitching as Straub
gave up four runs in three innings for
a disappointing 6-5 loss.
In the week's finale, the Garnet
Tide jumped out to a 4-0 lead. Jeremy
Bonder '97 pitched masterfully, hurling shutout ball over six innings and
allowing only one hit. New skipper
Brad Hoffman decided to bring in
Hudson to close the deal. The four
run lead quickly evaporated as the
Garnet Tide started kicking the ball
around and surrenderedfour unearned
runs. In the bottom of the seventh,
Bonder walked with one out, but was
erased when Frank Santora '96
grounded into a fielder's choice.
Straub (3-4, 3 rbi) tripled, plating
Santora and giving the Tide a 5-4
victory.
Monday, the Tide traveled to
Moravian and quickly dug itself a 70 hole. Dave Lischer '97 pitched 3.7
innings of shutoutrelief as the Garnet
Tide offense, led by Matt Grossman
'96 (.391) and Sousa mounted a determined comeback, falling just short
8-7. Tuesday, Neumann College

Men's Lacrosse Splits
By

Pat Donaghy

The men's lacrosse team began
Division 111play this week after an 02 start against scholarship schools.
The Garnet were unsure where they
would stand against the same level of
competition, because they were blown
out in both contests. A 1-1 week saw
two completely differentSwarthmore
teams on the field; a 7-5 victory over
Stockton State (NJ) saw the
Swarthmore team acting as a cohesive unit, winning most ground balls
and controlling the offense. The 10-5
defeat at the hands ofScranton came
as a result of a Swarthmore team
being very undisciplined, frequently
turning over the ball and getting many
unnecessary penalties.
After a week of relaxation during
break, the Garnet were fired up to
play Stockton last Saturday.
Swarthmore came out strong, as seniors Ben Seigel, Andy Place and
Will Craig scored to give the Garnet
an early 3-1 lead. When Place rocketed an underhanded upper-corner
shot, it was clear that the Garnet had
momentum heading into the half.
The second half has been the nem-

of hard-core body-sculpting.
The week of exhaustive training
and a pleasure trip to Disney World
(a non-starting big Johnsonprevented
beach excursions) culminated in a
star-studded meet against University
of Miami and other Div. I powerhouses. Despite speedy competition,
Danielle Duffy '9B pulled in an impressive eighth in the 200; her whizbang time of 26.1 guarantees there
will soon be more to tell about her
track triumphs.
Catherine Laine '9B stormed
through 100 in 13.62 (9th place)
and Stephanie Herring '99 bounded
to ninth place in the 100 hurdles.
Breaking away from the pack, Betsy
Davis '96 hopped like the Cadbury
bunny over 400 of hurdles to nab a
top-quality plastic trophy topped by a
gold runner. The pride of New Jersey, Jill Wildonger '97, marked up
another 400 m to her season. Donna
Griffin '99 debuted in the 800 m with
a strong first lap to finish up with a
solid time.
The sprints finished up with the
famous 4X400m relay, which posted
a season best 4:15. Rounding the oval
of speed, Alison Schirmer '97 and
Danielle Wall '9B paced out 6 second
PRs in the 1500 with times of 5:06
and 5:07, respectively.
The real action begins this weekend with an open meet at Franklin
and Marshall where the women are
sure to sink their teeth into the competition, tearing them apart with the
vigor of ferrets in heat.
Except for this weekend's meet,
the Swarthmore women's track team
will stick close to home, so don't
worry, you too will be able to get a
piece ofthe action and experience the
glory of our bodies in beautiful motion.

even more miserable pitching from
Neumann, the Knights decided to call
it quits, giving the Garnet Tide 10-1
victory. Hudson picked up the brief
win, his second of the young season,
and Matt Wiggins '96 (.333, 4 rbi)
and Grossman each chipped in 2

R.8.1.
Heading into conference play this
weekend, the Garnet Tide is playing
well. The Tide seems to have zeroed
in on the areas where they most needed
improvement: the team is batting .291,
the opposition is batting .239 and the
team ERA is 3.57. The team is fielding at a .928 clip, and catcher Clayton
is throwing out 23% (3-13) of would
be base stealers.
However, all is not well in the
GarnetTide camp. Pitcher/designated
hitter Sousa has been experiencing
some arm problems but is expected to
be fine. Clayton has come down with
mononucleosis and it is feared that he
might be lost for the season. Shortstop Bob Mascia '96 tore his posterior cruciate ligament, but is looking
to be back in 7-10 days.

esis of the Garnet, and they were
determined not to fall apart. A couple
of defensive breakdowns let Stockton crawl back into the game,and the
score was tied 5-5 at the end of three
quarters. But the Garnet defense
played their heart out in the fourth
quarter and shut down the Stockton
offense. Freshman goalie Elijah Porter, who finished with ten saves, had
five key saves in the period and didn't
allow a goal. Porter earned a spot on
the conference honor roll as a result
of the fantastic performance. Offensively, Craig and Erik Griffin '96
finished out the scoring to ensure the
7-5 victory. Seigel finished with two
goals and three assists in his first
game after moving from attack to
midfield, a great move by coach Pat
Gress, who earned his first collegiate
head coaching victory.
On Wednesday, the men hosted
Scranton, a very athletic but undisciplined team. Instead of continuing
their excellent playing, the Garnet
fell apart early and were behind 5-1 at
the end of the first quarter. Frustrations then built up and continued
throughout the game,resulting in nine
Garnet penalties on which Scranton
continuously capitalized. A 7-3 halftime score quickly turned into a 9-3
early third quarter deficit.
At this point, Gress changed the
offense to let Seigel, Place, and Pat
Donaghy '9B dodge against shortstick middies. The ploy enabled the
Garnet to get off good shots, but luck
was not on Swarthmore's side, as the
three hit the post five times in the
second half, and the end result was a
10-5 loss. Goals were scored by seniorsKevin Frazier, Craig, Place, and
Seigel, who also had two assists. Porter had another big day in net, registering 18 saves while keeping the
Garnet in the game. The Garnet will
travel to Shenendoah this weekend
before hosting Colby on Wednesday
afternoon.
