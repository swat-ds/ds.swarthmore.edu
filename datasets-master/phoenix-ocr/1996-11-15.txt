Scheuer Room, Once Closed to Students, Now Available
Administration responds
to student requests
to open space to students
By

Min Lee

As a result of several recent requests from
students to use theScheuer Room in Kohlberg
Hall, the College has reconsidered its policy
for reserving the space.
According to Larry Schall, associate vice
president for facilities and services, there had
never been any established guidelines for
making reservations until the issue was
brought up by several requests from student
groups this fall. However, Schall adds, "It

was common practice since the room opened coordinatorfor "Take Back the Night" activilate last year not to have students reserve the ties, contacted Paula Dale, space use coordiplace." He further emnator, to inquire

not seek a further explanation from Dale
regarding therefusal, but instead reserved the
room through Karen Henry, gender education advisor.
Seth Harvey '97 had also contacted Dale
towards the end of September with the intention of reserving the Scheuer Room for a
black activist conference to be held on campus. He received a confirmation from Dale
soon after he submitted the request. However, Vincent Jones '9B, a fellow organizer,
received a reply from her saying that a tentative reservation had been made on his behalf,
but that it had to be confirmed by Schall,
since students were not normally allowed to
reserve the room. In the end Schall (old Dale

that he did not approve of the reservation.
After October break, Dale sent Jones and
Harvey another message asking them about
the sponsors of the event, suggesting that
they reserve the room under the name of a
member of the faculty or administration involved in the conference. This provided a
solution for the organizers, since the conference was sponsored by the President's Office, and various College departments. Nevertheless, the response greatly displeased
Harvey: "I was offended by the fact that
students had been singled out as not being

Collection Addresses
Rights of Expression
Students, faculty and staff
discuss rights, limits, and

responsibilities of speech
By Tony

Sturm

About 100 students, faculty and staff attended the first Collection of the year to
discuss the recent report "Rights and Responsibilities of Expression at Swarthmore" at the
Friends Meeting House last Friday afternoon.
The College Planning Committee's Task
Force on Speech and the Academic Community released the report in late October. The
Task Force's report was published in the
November 1 issue of The Phoenix.
Members of the Task Force present included Hans Oberdiek, professor of philosophy, Larry Westphal, professor of economics, Associate Dean Tedd Goundie, Dean
Ngina Lythcott, Mark Friedberg '9B, Seth
Harvey '97, and Nora Johnson, assistant professor of English. They answered questions

and listened to input from the audience.
Oberdiek opened the Collection with
brief summary of the goals of the report, anc
how the committee put together the report.
He said, "Nothing in this report was a compromise; it was all a result of consensus. We
argued our way to each point."
Lythcott continued after Oberdiek, stating
the current policy, and how the report would
change Swarthmore's current procedure involving "harassing expression." She said that
currently, the College would adjudicate
fraudulent expression, expression that threatens violence, and harassing expression that is
"personal, degrading, and repeated."
Lythcott also noted that there are "a variety
of options" for those who feel they are being
harassed. Students can just walk away; they
can engage in public shunning, non-verbally
disapprove, publicly decry the harasser, or go
to the Deans' Office, among other things.
Johnson also contributed before the floor
was opened, reminding all present that the

benefits weighed,

For seventeen consecutive years a

Selverian brother has shed blood, sweat,
and tears on the football field for the
Garnet Tide.
On November 16,when Kurk Selverian
'97 plays his final down, a great dynasty
of Swarthmore athletics will sadly come
to a close.
For Stephen and Sandra Selverian,
proud parents of seven children in all, "It
has been a great experience, and we loved
coming to the games."
Beginning with Rich, a defensive lineman, in 1980, six brothers in all have
started for the Tide. Two years later, Jeff
joined his older brother and played running back from' 82-' 85. Mark followed as
a running back from' 85-'88. Greg played
both nose tackle and running back from
'B7-'9O. Art played linebacker from 'B9'92. Finally, Kurk enrolled in the fall of
'93 and has played every game since.
When all is said and done, for 160
straight games, at least one of the six
brothers has proudly contributed to

Swarthmore's football tradition.
It is fitting that the tradition is going out
with a bang. For Kurk, the six-foot, 250pound "baby" brother, this year has been
a typically great year. If there were a
statistic measuring tenacity and desire,
Kurk would be among the national leaders.
"He just gets the whole defense fired
up. He is a leader by his actions and is an
incredible player," said defensive coordinator Don Burns.
Burns also stated that Kurk selflessly
offered to play offensive line in an effort
to help a struggling team any way he
could. When asked what kind of an impact
Kurk has made on the other side of the
ball, quarterback Pat Straub '97 recalled
one play in particular against Franklin &
Marshall.
"He [Kurk] took their 300-pound allconference tackle and proceeded to tell
him that the ball was going right at him,"
Straub recalled excitedly. "Then, he
knocked him twelve yards backwards, all
the while letting him know about it!"
There is an evident sadness when Kurk
describes his feelings about Swarthmore
football. "I remember watching games
here when I was eight or nine," Kurk
explained. "My brothers [and I] used to go

Parrish Hall, home to both students, faculty, and administrative offices, is currently
being analyzed to see what renovations need
to be implemented.
With the passing of the American Disabilities Act, it is necessary to increase accessibility to the building. The College hopes to
renovate Parrish to meet the ADA's standards, abide by updated building codes, shift
administrativeand faculty offices, and generally make the building more mechanically

efficient.

Some measures to increase accessibility
have already begun to be implemented: a
ramp has been built outside the entrance
nearest McCabe Library. In the future, elevators will most likely be installed in Parrish,
and a debate over how many are needed is
already in progress.
Renovation is also being considered in
anticipation offuture problems. One example
is air-conditioning: because of the layout of
the building, it is currently difficult to pump
fresh air into all of Parrish. Window airconditioning is, unfortunately, expensive.

water system, which is more efficient; the

application of this method for Parrish is also
under consideration.
Building code concerns are also a priority.
When Parrish was built 115 years ago, the
builders complied withthe building and safety
codes in effect at the time.The law states that
whenever a building is renovated, it must be
brought up to the most recent building and
safety codes: "A building of this age is expected to meet the code of the age in which it
was built," saidMark Evans, director ofplanning and construction, who is in charge of
renovation plans. "If we decide that Parrish
needj major changes, we must meet the more
recent codes in the process."
The work in progress right now is simply
an examination of Parrish's current condition. At the moment, it is not even clear just
how large the problem is in terms of what
needs to be done.Since there are no plans for
renovations in the near future, no schedule or
budget have been created. Right now, Evans
and his crew are trying to understand the
spatial use of the building, and are talking
with each department located within. Interviews are being conducted to determinewhat
the administrative staff and faculty think of
the space already allotted to them in Parrish,
and whether that space is adequate for their
needs or not.
This analysis is being done now in order to
cause the least disruption on campus. The

areas of Parrish used least efficiently (or not
used at all) are under scrutiny, and plans for
improvement have been tentatively discussed.
"A number ofdepartments [in Parrish] do not
have the space they need," said Evans. One
possibility concerns increasing the space al-.
lotted to the currently crowded post office.
However, for whatever needs to be made
larger, something must be reduced in size.
Luckily, the requests of faculty and
administratives so far have been reasonable,
as everyone is requesting space according to
their needs. Yet faculty, staff, and students
alike are concerned with what will happen
when and if these renovations take place.
Students currently living in Parrish are concerned with the inconvenience that would
result. "I know that I definitely do not wantto
wake up to the sound of construction," said
one Parrish resident. "And I don't want to
spend my years at Swarthmore surrounded
by the construction, either." There is also
concern as to what would happen to all the
administrative offices located there while
any internal construction would take place.
Some changes are planned for the near
future: some of the WSRN offices are to
assume other roles, and plans to move the
CRC to the fifth floor are in progress. However, further renovations for Parrish only
exist in the planning stage right now. "When
we are finished with our research," saidEvans,
"we will begin to make plans, and assign high
and low priorities."

"Smokery" No Longer at Sharpies
Donald Holmstrom, also known as "Smokey," is no longer working at the College.
Holmstrom was hired at the beginning ofthis year as front-end manager of Sharpies.
His last day of work was Monday, November 11.
Linda McDougall, Director of Dining Services, refused to comment on whatled to
this development. Lee Robinson, employee relations manager, stated that issues
surrounding employment are strictly confidential. All decisions regarding College
employees, however, are made "carefully and thoughtfully."
Larry Schall, associate vice president for facilities and services, stated that "by law
and College policy, this kind of information is strictly confidential. We would
certainly not want to do anything that would cause him [Holmstrom] or any other
employee difficulty after they have left employment here." He did state that this
development was "not a surprise."
Holmstrom's position will be filled after the "usual process of advertising the job,
within the College and then outside, and then interviews," said Schall.

Muslim Students Granted Support Group Status
The Muslim Student Association succeeded in its appeal to the decision of the
Student Council Charter Committee to withhold support group status from their
recently approved charter. According to Student Council's chartering instructions
from the fall of 1995, support groups "provide support to people who are members
of groups who have been systematically discriminated against, or organizations that
show valid reason for an exclusive membership." Shamsah Ebrahim '99 and Ethan
Devine 'OO requested support group status because they believed that previous
Muslim student organizations, of which there were at least two according to Devine,
were unsuccessful because of the lack of such status.
According to Sean Barney '9B, co-coordinator of Student Council, the appeals
body agreed. Barney reported that the appeals body, which consists ofthose members
not on Charter Committee, voted 3 to 2 with one abstention to overturn the original
charter and add the support group status. Those in favor ofoverturning the charter to
grant support group status were Jude Uzonwanne '9B, Giridhar Srinivasan '9B, and
Andrew Lund '99. Those opposed were Barney and Alyssa Rayman-Read '99, with

Will Nessly '99 abstaining. The Phoenix was unable to reach any of the voting
membersfor comment, though a summary ofthe arguments ofthe anti-support group
side were characterized, by some members ofStudent Council, as a basic disagreement with the concept of exclusive groups.

Tarble Game Room Study Breaks

>

Last Wednesday evening, Hallowell basement held its study break in the Tarble
game room. The often-empty room was filled with students who were happily
munching on pizza over games of pool and table tennis. The students welcomed the
chance to have a study break outside of their hall; their R.A., Lyndsley Wilkerson '97,
said that holding the study break in the game room was a "wonderful idea."
Gnanesh Patel 'OO came up with the idea for the study break after noticing that
people didn't"usually get the chance to use the game room." Tanisha Little '97, one
of the SAC co-coordinator responsible for maintaining the game room, agrees. "For
a school the size of Swarthmore, the game room is underused," she said.
Little said that allowing students to reserve the game room for study breaks is not
yet a permanent policy. However, if enough interest is shown, she, along with Jen
Leigh, coordinator of student activities, and SAC co-coordinator Aisha MossKoonce '9B would probably make it available for reservations on a permanent basis.
Little said if a hall wants to utilize the game room for a study break, she or MossKoonce should be contacted. The game room will be open for reservations each
Wednesday from 10:00 p.m. to midnight.

The Social Affairs Committee disburses roughly $lOOO per week from
the Student ActivitiesFund to support
non-alcoholic social events. According to the Guide to Student Life, SAC
is responsible for holding "two nonalcoholic, creative social events a
month." In additon, SAC is also supposed to help fund all-campus parties
thrown by various student groups.
To date, SAC has organized the
Homecoming weekend and the "Let
Them Eat Cake" study break in October, and hired a caricaturist thismonth.
SAC is also planning this weekend's
Fall Formal.

Although SAC has funded several
otherevents, students have complained
that the social scene has been slow,
and one student who preferred to remain anonymous said, "It's basically
equivalent to nothing at all."
SAC co-coordinator Aisha MossKoonce '9B said that September was
slow because it was the beginning of
the year and consequently difficult to
organize. Moss-Koohce also said that
the caricatureartist "wentreally well,"
but according to Erin Figueira '99
"the line was really...long." Only 12
to 15 students were caricatured, and
Figueira and others estimated 20 to 30
students were disappointed.
SAC co-coordinator Tanisha Little
'97 said that the major obstacle SAC
faces is the lack of student input. MossKoonce also cited the "ebb and flow"
of student proposals as a difficulty.
Both SAC coordinators encouraged
students to present proposals to SAC,
especially for Friday nights. Little
asked that students use the Suggestion
Box on the SAC bulletin board in
Parrish. She also said that they should
"feel comfortable bringing things to
us" by dropping into the Wednesday
SAC dinner meetings in Sharpies
Room 6 or by contacting either her or
Moss-Koonce.

Eraka Rouzorondo, an independent scholar
from Washington, D.C., gave a talk this past
Monday entitled, "African American History, GenderRelations, and Their Interaction
with Corporate America."
At the beginning ofher speech, Rouzorondo
introduced the philosophy of Afrocentricity
and its edict of educating the whole mind. In
introducing this concept, she used an example of the manner in which the physical
chemistry of a simple object can relate to
one's life and its purpose.
Thinking is the application of knowledge
and understanding by using both the left and
right hemispheres of the brain. In this philosophy, knowledge is only useful if it is
applied with understanding of the concept. It
is not enough to simply know a fact; one must
understand the implications that the fact has
on one's life and the lives of others.
The speaker then went on to give a brief
historical account of the African people and
civilization in Egypt, noting academic contributions and ideologies. Among these ethics
are the concepts of the inseparable union of

which other groups have done before." Ultimately Jones and Harvey decided to keep the
tentative reservation for the time being.
However, after receiving Dale's message,
Harvey called Schall to express his opinion
on the issue; he urged him to enforce a "functional restriction" for the room instead of
banning its use by specific groups. In reply,
Schall told him that the latest requests had in
fact sparked an ongoing discussion amongst
the President's Staff concerning the reservation policy. Dale, in light of the recent requests, had discussed the issue with Schall,
who, in turn, brought it to the attention of
PresidentBloom and the rest ofthe President's
Staff. (Dale could not be reached for comment in time for the publication of this ar-

College's goal is "to keep things from happening, instead of just reacting."
Once open discussion started, there were
some moments of awkward silence, but
people soon engaged in active discussion.
An issue which generated debate was
whether the all-campus e-mails sent by
Lythcott were beneficial, and if the specific
harassing remarks shouldhave been included
in the message. Friedberg and Westphal
stressed that the point of the e-mails was to
encourage a dialogue.
Another issue addressed how, in thereport,

tide.)Harvey recalls Schall commenting that
the original policy stemmed from the concern
that "student use would lead to the degradation of the room," and that students have had
a past of being hard on campus space in
general.
About a week later, Jones received word
from Dale that the reservation had been confirmed. The President's Staff had reached a
consensus thatrequests to reserve the Scheuer
Room would be considered on the basis of the
nature of the concerned function, not who
was making the request.
According to President Bloom, the new
policy states that "any campus group can

"repeated" meant. Westphal provided the
committee's definition: "Repeated means, in

particular, that [a harassing expression] is
repeated after the perpetrator knows that it is
harassing."
The report was based on a speech code
adopted at Arizona State University. On
Wednesday night and at lunch on Thursday,
the community had another chance to converse with the committee, as the Friday Collection had to be adjourned because of 2:00

After describing the history ofAfrican culture and its basis in knowledge with understanding, Rouzorondo outlined the differences between and reasons for theAfrocentric

Before going lo Wesleyan, Durkan held
several positions at libraries in Ireland. There,
he served as Associate Librarian, Technical
Services Librarian, head of the Catalogue
Department, and Rare Books Librarian.
While at Swarthmore, Durkan made several lasting contributions. These include the
organization of the College's science collections to create Cornell Library. He is also
responsible for the automation of the library' s
card catalog as well as taking it on line to form
a Tri-College catalog with Bryn Mawr and
Haverford Colleges.
Durkan was also responsible for sponsoring readings by contemporary writers and
poets, including 1995 Nobel Prize winner
Seamus Heaney. As a scholar, Durkan tought
classes on Irish literatureat both Swarthmore
and Wesleyan. He also published several
books and articles including Sean O'Casey:
A Bibliography and W.B. Yeats 1865-1935:
A Catalogue of his Works and Associated
Items in Olin Library.
One week befor passing away, Durkan

the creative spirit. He told the class, "Youand
I are at an important juncture in our lives
where we are both taking steps into the territory of 'the marvelous.'
"Our journey into the marvelous must be
one where we equip ourselves by ridding
ourselves of the weaknesses and failings that
would impede our vision. We must be open
and rceptive to that vision. A vision of a
world where love is nourished, where a climate of murturing is created where wherever
we are we fill thecrevices with sweetness and

Questioning safety issues on campus.
Two years ago, a group of students, Public Safety officers, and Deans'
Office staff members came together to identify ways to enhance safety
provisions on campus. The College has taken many steps to make the
campus a safer place, but budgetary constraints prevent further measures
from being undertaken.
We applaud the addition of lights along the path from the train station to
Sharpies Dining Hall, along Sharpies Drive, near the Women's Resource
Center, and by the loading dock on the side ofMcCabe Library. Yet the path
behind McCabe leading to Willets is stillrather poorly lit, and because of a
change in electrical wiring codes, a whole new wiring system would be
necessary before more lights could be installed.
After the group's suggestions, the College initiated a pilot program to
assess the effectiveness of phones outside of dormitories. It is unreasonable
for the College to expect students not to prop open doors for guests after
midnight if it provides those guests with no other means of entering the
dorms. To this end, the College has decided to install such phones outside
of Mertz, Dana, Hallowell, Wharton, Woolman, and Bond/Worth/Lodges,
but Parrish residents will have to wait until the spring.
The College has implemented other beneficial measures, such as adding
an extra shuttle at night. The Garnet Patrol is now staffed by civilians, which
enables full coverage of weekend shifts. A self-defense course for women
is currently in its third year here.
The Public Safety Department itself plays the most important role as a
valuable source of protection and other services, no matter how many
phones or lights happen to be installed. They patrol the campus in search of
suspicious persons and serve as switchboard operators; in a pinch, they'll
even jump start a car, help change a tire, or give directions.
Public Safety is currently working overtime on public relations. They
have their own board next to the mailroom for announcements. Terri Narkin
e-mails us with awareness and preventive tips. Later this yeareach dorm will
be assigned a Public Safety officer so that every RA will personally know
one of those people in the white vehicles.
But in a recent discussion with Owen Redgrave, director ofPublicSafety,
we found that budget constraints strongly influence the types of safety
precautions undertaken. Chain locks were recently placed on all the dorm
room doors, but why weren't doors with peep holes put into place instead?
And what about measures to provide enhanced security for dorms with glass
windows right next to the entranceway, such as Danawell, which facilitate
entrance for people who should not be dropping in on our study breaks?
Redgrave spoke about "more bang for the buck," whichhe considers to be
the most effective and efficient manner to spend the Public Safety budget
with optimal effects. We understandthat doors with one-waypeep holes and
entirely new wiring systems are expensive and that measures such as desk
sitters at every entrance to a dorm are extreme and unnecessary for
Swarthmore. We also understand that Redgrave does not decide how the
College's funds are allocated.
In light of the increased number of students at Swarthmore, Swarthmore
shouldconsider the priority given to the Public Safety budget at Swarthmore.
The Women's Resource Center works as a soundboard for students concerned about safety at Swarthmore. More Public Safety on patrol, improved
lighting, and prompt installation of dorm phones would be a nice start.

Applauding Survivors Week on campus.
Survivors Week is of inestimable importance on this campus. Educating
the campusabout issues of sexualassault will both prevent incidentsand help
survivors feel that they are not alone. At Swarthmore, this week is important
because according to national surveys, 1 in 4 college women have experienced either rape or attempted rape since age 14. The story does not end at
college—victimization rates are highest for females aged 16-34.
It is also important to recognize that more than 80 percent of sexual
assaults are committed by someone the victim knows: an acquaintance,
relative, or friend. Nine in ten of these acquaintance rapes are not reported.
Swarthmore is not immune from this phenomenon —non-consensual sex
happens but may often not be reported because of the victim's shame,
confusion, or guilt.
Survivors Week also promotes awareness about what constitutes rape as
opposed to consensual sex. Although 1 in 12 college men admits to acts that
meet legal definitions of rape, few identify themselves as rapists. The
information available at the tables in Parrish, onposters around campus, and
from the Take Back the Night (TBTN) speakers emphasize the need for
mutual respect in sexual relationships.
Sexual assault can also happen to men. A man has a one in ten chance of
being a victim of sexual assault during his lifetime. Today, a men's TBTN
dinner will be hosted by Phi Psi at 5 p.m., to which all men are invited. At
this dinner, there will be a discussion about what men can do to prevent
violence against women and how men themselves can be survivors.
We are pleased that Survivors Week is scheduled during the first semester
this year, instead ofthe latter halfof the second semester. Hopefully, this will
encourage survivors to join Friends of Survivors for the remainder of the
year. This group can be invaluable for people who have experienced sexual
assault and are coming to terms with the repercussions on their lives.
We commend the organizers for their work. The Clothesline Project in
Parrish Parlors is extremely powerful—it reminds us thatthere are survivors
of sexual assault among us—about 30 of the T-shirts were made by
Swarthmore students. Signs which say: "I'm a survivor and I take Econ. 1"
also force us to recognize thatrape and sexual assault can happen to us and
to people we know. Please show your support for survivors of rape and
sexual assault.

very, discrimination, racism and government sanctioned oppression in-

Have modern technology and drastic changes in the American economy
rendered Black people in this country
obsolete? I'm inclined to think that
several factors have displaced a large
number ofBlack workers from stable
sources of income without significant opportunities to adapt
to the forces
transforming
our country,
economy and
society. In order to understand my perspective, one
must consider
historical patterns ofBlack

participation
in the labor

market and the manner in which other
large-scale societal changes have
impacted people of African descent.
Since the beginnings of this great
nation, Black people have constituted
a low-skilled labor force to be exP'oited bv the 'mainstream" society.
For the last 200 years, enslaved Africans' blood, sweat and tears yielded
vast amounts of material and financial wealth for this country. Several
individuals postulate that America
would never have been able to develop into the economic, political and
military powerhouse that it has, without the wealth generated directly and
indirectly from slave labor.
Immediately following the demise
of the "peculiar institution" of sla-

hibited many Blacks from ascending
to the ranks of the nation's cultural,
corporate, and intellectual elite. As a
result, African-Americans could only
find low-skilled, blue-collar jobs in
the growing manufacturing sector.
In fact, millions of Black people
migrated to urban areas to take advantage of the jobs created by the
newly-built and expanding factories
of the north. An example of this phenomenon can be found in nearby
Chester, PA. The riverside locale of
the city made it a prime location for
various industries interested in utilizing the waterway to transport goods.
Consequently, thousands of Black
Americans from the south settled in
the surrounding area.
Many of the African-Americans
who migrated to the cities found factory jobs which paid enough to sustain a family with considerable stability. Moreover, these jobs did not
require much education or experie"n£& Since, most of these Black
Americans did not have access to
adequate formal schooling, the vast
majority of them could only qualif\
for these types of jobs. The post-war
economy continually produced
enough manufacturing jobs to employ a good portion of the Black
urban dwellers.
However, for the past few decades,
our country has been undergoing a
major transformation.Several economists, political scientists, sociologists,
and other experts claim that America
has become a post-industrial society

SAC's Pursestrings
Need to Be Tightened
By Tony

Sturm

Last Wednesday, the Social Affairs Committee (SAC) brought a
cartoonist onto campus in order to
drawcaricatures of students who went
to Paces that night. I thought-to myself, "Did I ask for caricatures?" This
brought back memories of SAC s attempt to fabricate some non-existent
school spirit and spirit for our football team with the whole Homecoming idea a month and a half earlier. I
had to give them credit for trying, but
when I walked across Parrish Beach
on that Friday night, glancing sometimes at the impressive fireworks that
were being detonated overhead,
sometimes at the cute families from
the Borough seated on Parrish Beach
supplying the obligatory ooooh' s and
aaaaah's, I thought the: same thing.
"Did I ask for fireworks? Did anyone
ask for fireworks?"
When Swarthmore touts its merits
to prospective students, I do not remember them saying,"We have a
solid academic reputation and a beautiful campus. Plus, we have fireworks
and cartoonists on campus, purchased
with your money for your enjoyment!" I wonder how happy tuition
and activity fee-paying parents are
about some of the things purchased
with their money.
I remember being shown around
the school on a tour and getting the
"everything is free here on campus"
spiel by my peppy tour guide. Well,
that's kind of true. Everything is included in your fees.
That is the problem with students
here. We do not seem to realize that
when school money is spent, it is our
money that is spent. Swarthmore collects $2OB dollars from students every year for activities fees, and much
of that money is given to SAC. SAC
then either allocates it to students
with event ideas or spends it themselves on all-campus activities. And I
am seriously questioning the validity
of those activities. At least SAC has
not hired any masseuses yet this year,
which although popular, are an egregious waste ofmoney. Have a friend
give you a back rub, dammit! We
don't need to pay $5O an hour to
professionals for them to rub down
stressed out Swatties.
When SAC does something stupid
with "its" money, people just scoff at
SAC and forget about it. But that is
not how it should be. SAC needs to be
accountable for how it spends money.
Who here can name the three allcampus events that SAC has sponsored so far this year? Okay, I can,
but only because I thought hard and,
being a Phoenix section editor, it is
my jobto be alert. We had the Homecoming activities, although, as I remember, the official party was actually alcoholic. We also had the cartoonist, whose name I forgot, and I
recall seeing signs up once for a SAC-

sponsored all campus study break in
Parrish a few months ago. It was one
of those study breaks where they basically bought pizza and soda and
told us to enjoy ourselves.
But those were lame activities. So
what do I propose that wou§d be fun
and exciting? Well, J don't have any
proposals, and that is the problem
here. We, as a campus, cannot come
up with innovative ideas for activities, and this is why I think SAC has
too much money. SAC is spending
money just because it can and because it is required to do so by College regulations.
Aside from Homecoming, which
had substantial advertising, you had
to be quite alert to hear about the
activities SAC planned this year,
which brings me to my next point.
SAC allocates $lOOO a week "with
which to maintain a balanced social
calendar each weekend," according
to the Guide to Student Life. These
events must be free, and campuswide. So, can you think where your
$lOOO went last week? Well, there
were two free all-campus parties on
Saturday night. Did each of those
parties get $500? If they, did, I wish
they would have spent it on something besides liquids. If they didn't,
where did the other money go?
I realize that when weekend nights
go by and no on-campus activity is
occurring besides the weekly movie,
it is not SAC's fault, or it is only
partially SAC's fault. It is not entirely theirresponsibility to make sure
that something is happening on campus each weekend, but it is in their
job description to "maintain a balanced social calendar," and I would
thinkthat they could initiate an event
after a Wednesday meeting at which
no one had any Friday night proposals. How hardis it to hire a DJ and buy
some soda and chips?
Every dollar that SAC allocates is
supposed to go to an all-campus event.
So why does no one know where the
free, all campus events are every
weekend? I propose that SAC be required to publicize where theirmoney
is going every week. This should be
posted somewhere,either on their
board in Parrish or under
swat.announce.general. We have a
right to know where every dollar of
SAC money goes, since it is allegedly being used in a way that all of us
can benefit.
I am not declaring that SAC is evil.
What I am saying is that SAC should
seriously reread its charter and do a
better job of providing the services
for which it was created. SAC has
just too much money. Our student
activities fee was increased last year.
Was this to cover the rising cost of
pizza? SAC should do a better job of
providing social affairs to the campus, and do a better job of notifying
us about what our options are on a
given night.

increased capital mobility and greater
telecommunication capabilities. This,
in addition to other factors, triggered
massive layoffs in the low-skill manufacturing sector.
Now, instead of building factories
or plants in urban areas, businesspersons have begun setting up and
moving their operations overseas to
exploit cheaper labor and less strict
governmental regulations. Hence,
Black people have lost their primary
source for jobs.
This scenario would not be so troubling ifAfrican-Americans were better prepared for the jobs being produced in today's highly informationbased and technology-driven
economy. Unfortunately, this tends
not to be the case.
In fact, I once heard a statistic that
the average White student gets twice
as much money spent on him or her
for educational purposes than the
average Black student. Moreover, the
school systems populated by African-Americans tend to be understaffed, poorly funded, structurally
unsound and largely ignored.
The consequences of current socii-fal ii .<:■!"formitir>ns can best ho MTU
in Chester. In the 1950's and 60' s, the
area experienced much economic

growth and even boasted one of the
best shopping districts in the vicinity.
However, several plant closures and
the subsequent job losses created the
Chester we all know today. To make
things worse, many of the businesses
opening in the city cause more harm
than good (can we say Environmental Racism?).
Unfortunately, the likelihood that
Chester will experience a massive
influx of capital investment in the
near future is nearly non-existent.
Conditions will most likely worsen.
Conversely, the suburbs surrounding
Chester will continue to be blessed
with a good deal of positive economic activity. Suburban communities nationwide have rarely had a
problem providing enough jobs which
allow their residents to live the
"American dream."
Given these conditions, it is irresponsible to question efforts (for example, last year's Million Man
March) of Black people to draw attention to and seek solutions to such
problems. After all, very few politicians or other government officials
have proposed solutions to the Great
nepre««i«r! like conditions thnt continue to afflict the Black community
in this country.

An Open Letter to the College Community

Rising Intolerance
Refutes Our Reputation
You see our name emblazoned on
the headlines of newspapers as the
top liberal arts college, and we stand
up straighter and prouder now that
U.S. News & World Report finds us
to be the best place to receive a liberal
arts education. But still it happens.
Our school has become practically
synonymous with "open-minded,"
and nowhere will you find freedom
of expression carried out to the limits
as it is in this institution. Yet it has
occurred repeatedly. Swarthmore
College rises above most other colleges in that its student body is comprised of some of the most intelligent
and well-educated minds of this nation. It should frighten us that even in
a place like this, such a monstrous
thing can occur.
I speak of the numerous racist, sexist and homophobic incidents which
have swept over our campus in the
last few weeks like a bush fire. A
Latino student was accosted recently
by someone whooverheard her speaking Spanish and was told that if she
wanted to speak Spanish, she should
not have come to the United States in
the first place and should go back to
her own country. Many students have
had "faggot" thrown in their faces at
parties and elsewhere. And the unbelievably vulgar homophobic phrase
spray painted in Parrish, "Fuck homos," should serve to shock most of
us into realizing that the intolerance
we may have felt shielded from in
coming to this institution is alive and
smacking us directly in the face.
And more disturbing is that these
three incidents are far from isolated.
The sheer amount of these discriminatory incidents, which have all occurred in the past few weeks, is totally unprecedented. Bigotry seems
to have permeated the College's atmosphere as of late, and many students have reported feeling its unwelcome presence. If they have not
been injured by the physical sting of
a verbal comment directed at them,
they have sensed a tension in the air
which has become more present in
recent weeks with the advent of so
many instances of expressed intolerance towards minorities.
Also quite unsettling is the way in
which these incidents are being dealt
with across the campus. A terrible
silence has descended over this Col-

lege each time the issues are brought
up, by students as well as by faculty.
Whether it is because of the discomfort surrounding the issues or the fear
of bringing up such a controversial
subject, the problem is simply not
substantially addressed. And when it
does arise in a conversation, it is
treated as mere gossip of what happened to whom. Different groups
aroundcampus are simply reacting to
these incidents as they come, realizing that they took no prior action to
help insure against this. The awareness which most of us were sure pervadedthis campus is not aspresent as
we believed. And this awareness must
be achieved if students are going to
be able to feel as secure as many once
did in this college.
To the perpetrators and would-be
perpetrators: this is not cool. This
closed-mindedness and inability to
accept others as more than their ethnic/sexual background does not belong at a school as sophisticated as
this one where two-dimensionality
does not exist. While you may feel
the need to alienate others because
you feel alienated here for whatever
reason, lashing out at people is not
the answer. Homophobic speech
merely lets people know that you are
uncomfortable with your own sexuality, racist attitudes show insecurity
about your own worth as a human
being, and xenophobia demonstrates
that you don't really feel you belong.
We must agree as a community
that expressions of hate, but more
importantly thesentimentbehin d such
expressions, are unacceptable to us.
Incidents such at these tear at the
fabric of our community, hitting especially hard because of the size of
this school. Trust is lost, as is the
ability to feel the absolute freedom
one encounters in such a liberalenvironment. And everyone must realize
that minorities are not the only ones
affected by these discriminatory incidents. Your turn will be next if this
continues; I guarantee it. Please do
not support any type of discrimination, and express your belief in the
need for a standard of decency so that
others may follow in your example.

Opinions

Lecture Format is
Intellectually Dulling
By

David King

There are many reasons why
Swarthmore College was my number
one choice throughout the whole college process last year. The campus is
beautiful, it's in a great location,
people are friendly...the list goes on
and on. However, the one aspect of
the school that appealed to me more
than anything else was the size of its
classes.
I have always been the kind of
person who thrives in small classes
with a lot of individual attention as
opposed to large, lecture-style ones.
Hence, when I first looked up
Swarthmore in one of the college
guide books, my immediate reaction
was one of ecstatic disbelief. This
college was too good to be true, I
thought; I agreed with the principles
upon which it was based, it had everything I was looking for, both academically and extra-curricularly, and
its classes were smalland taught only
by professors. I knew immediately
that it was the school for me.
Today, I feel the same way, if not
even more
strongly about
Swarthmore. It still is the best school
for me, and I feel very lucky to have
been accepted. Yet,in the past two
and a half months here, I have come
to realize thatthe format ofmy classes
is not exactly what I had envisioned it
to be. Yes, most of my classes are
small (comparatively speaking), and
it definitely does seem like professors "want to be teaching undergraduates." However, I still feel that, in a
way, I have been disillusioned.
Of the five classes that I have taken
this semester, only one of them is
taught in a way in which the students
actually get involved in the class.The
professors are animated and go out of
their way to make the material interesting for us. While the assignments
they give us in class are challenging,
they are also fun. We don't mind
doing them, even ifthey require us to
think, because the professors really
engage us in what they are teaching,
and we are motivatedall the more for

In my other four classes, though,

the style of teaching is different. The
professors spend the period standing
in front of the room and talking. They
do not often pose specific questions
to the class (though they do accept
them), and they rarely, ifever, give us
exercises in class that require us to
split up into groups and talk, and
think, amongst ourselves as is the
case in my other class. These professors, essentially, lecture.
When I walk into these other
classes, I prepare myself for 50 or 75
minutes during which I don't have to
think. Yes, I have to copy down notes
from the board, but my brain isn't
stimulated. What could otherwise be
fascinating concepts are presented in
a way in which they seem uninteresting and almost dull, even in my favorite subject. The otherclass I mentioned has never been a strong subject of mine; but when I sit in the
classroom and interact with the professors, and when they go that extra
step to get all of us involved in the
class, to the point where we—dare I
say, get excited—about the
materiaL.the class comes alive.
Now, I will be the first to concede
that my classes are introductory
courses. I also understand that professors have a lot to get through in the
course of one semester, and because
of this, they have to move quickly.
I just think that if professors were
to have a discussion with the class,
rather than talk at them for an entire
period, more people would, in turn,
make an effort to listen to what they
have to say, think about it, and try to
digest it—rather than just scribble a
few key words down into their notes.
If professors were to make a real
attempt to draw their students into a
discourse in which everyone could
get interested, the students would feed
offof this and become more aroused
themselves, if only just a little bit.
As I said, I love Swarthmore, and I
am very happy to be here; but when it
comes to classes, I wish that they
could all be like that one, because that
one represents not only what I had
hoped Swarthmore classes would be
like, but how I think they should all
strive to be.

To the Editor,
Nazima Kadir made a worthy attack on racism in her article "Ascribe
to Model Minority Myth? Think
Again" (November 8, 1996), but I
find thatshe misunderstood the original intent of affirmative action and
was misinformed about the socioeconomic power ofAsian-Americans.
In the article, she criticizes "the perception thatAsian-Americans are not
a minority that should be included
under affirmative actions." It is my
understanding thataffirmative action
programs were initiated by the government in order to reduce or eliminate a huge, unlessening gap between
the socioeconomic power of Whites
and Blacks, and later Hispanics as
well. Once these gaps closed after a
generation or so, the programs would
be sent to the dustbin, with the belief
that a sealed gap would not reopen.
Today, large gaps remain, and so do
the programs designed to eliminate
them, though the latter appear much
more likely to depart first. Affirmative action was never intended as a
permanent state of government intervention to remedy minor or temporary inequities. So, to argue that
Asian-Americans be included in affirmative action programs designed
under this principle, would require
that one demonstrate a large and not
obviously receding gap in socioeconomic power.
In possible support of government
intervention, Kadir states that AsianAmerican households form a "sad
speck of socioeconomic power." According to the U.S. Census Bureau,
since 1988 Asians have had a higher
median household income than
Whites, Hispanics and Blacks. In
1995, it estimated that Asians had a
medianhouseholdincome of$41,629,
Whites earned $36,121, Hispanics

Senior Advice is Not to Let Work Run Your Life
To the Editor,
Looking back on my life, I recalled
nothing in particular about
Swarthmore but rather a stretch of
idyllic contentment. Ambiguous evenings spent dancing to Madonna in
the energetic sweatshop called Paces,
movies where the audience unabashedly cheered for the good guys and
booed the bad and everyone enjoyed
it, and pastoral afternoons sprawled
on Parrish Beach: these were the
things that I could remember. Somewhere underyears sprinkled withdust
I caught a glimpse of the ultimate
frisbee team practicing outside Mertz,
a notion of yet another night of
Sharpies french fries, and a vision of
innocent frosh unsure how to check

books out of the library.
But nowhere could I recollect the
tedium ofstudy or the laborious nights
in front of a computer monitor. I
wasn't sure why. Vaguely, ever so
vaguely, I thought it had something
to do with my own motley accumulation of memories. It also had to do
with some advice I got while I was at
Swat. "Live in the present," the fellow had told me. "No matter how
much work you do, there will always
be something left to do. Just accept
thatand leave timefor fun regardless
ofhow much work you have. Always
leave time for fun, and make sure
that's what you remember about
Swarthmore."

earned $24,085, and Blacks earned
$21,623. Despite these estimates, a
different estimate which may support Kadir's statement is that in 1995
only 8.5 percent of Whites versus
14.6percent of Asians found themselves below the poverty line (as well
as 29.3 percent of Blacks and 30.3
percent of Hispanics). I don't have
the statistics at hand, but I expect that
I could show that poor Asian-Americans are largely foreign-born (nearly
two-thirds of Asian-Americans are
foreign-born) and that the poverty
rate for native-born Asian-Americans
is at or, more likely, below that of
Whites. While immigrant poverty
may be an issue worth contemplating, as Brian Schwartz reminded me,
stepping off a boat, poor, is the story
of America; unless I have forgotten
some moment in history, an attempt
to reduce immigrant inequity would
be a totally unprecedented form of
government intervention.
Despite all theracistmumbo-jumbo
that is often used to define the term,
what makes Asian-Americans a
"model minority" is that after a single
generation most immigrant Asian
families achieve a level of economic
prosperity that most Blacks families
have not reached after several generations, even with a boost from affirmative action. If all minority
groups were so successful, affirmative action would not still be staggering onward today. The economic
success of theAsian-American population is no excuse to stereotype
Asians-Americans as "model students," but it does suggest that the
Asian-American population wouldbe
a good model for other minorities to
emulate, and it does argue for the
ineligibility of Asian-Americans for
affirmative action programs.

Class Consideration Should Come Before Race
To the Editor,
Something struck me when I read
Nazima Kadir' s article in last week's
Phoenix. I couldn't figure out exactly
what, so I read the article again. The
obvious and absurd fact was that she
was told that she could not apply for
the Ford Foundation's research grant
for the very reason that she was applying—she is Asian. She describes
that when the Ford Foundation told
her that she couldn't apply because
Asians are 'over-represented' they
are misunderstanding 'Asian.' They
operateonaracistnotionofthe 'model
minority' and they do not recognize
the diversity among Asians.
She questions what people think is
Asian, and what really is Asian; but
with regard to the Ford Foundation
qualifications, she raises something
else. Should generation matter, or
class background. Two examples:
"An upper-middle-class fifth generation Chinese American" and "a firstgeneration college student whose
family recently immigrated from
Cambodia, does not speak English,
and works for the minimum wage."
Does one deserve consideration, and
not the other? What if the applicant

has one white parent and one firstgeneration working-class minority
parent—or grandparent? From her
Latin American studies, Kadir must
know well the dangers of creating
literal socialhierarchies based on the
percentage of blood that is Native or
European. And that is definitely not a
direction we want to go with affirmative action.
And I remember listening to
Michael Williams' lecture last year.
He argued against affirmative action
on similar grounds. He said that policies which worked in his favor now
were still legally based on race; and
allowing race to be the legal basis for
policy could be reversed an used
against his interests in the future.
What he argued instead, and what I
believe Kadir implies, is that what
really matters is advantage and disadvantage (generation, class, etc.). It
is wrong that Kadir was told she
couldn't apply for a minority grant
because she's Asian, but her article
argues for a new framework for discourse on qualification for minority
grants, not based on racist notions of

minorities.

Student Council Needs Basic Changes
By

Kristen Jones & lan ChWC-

The agenda for last Sunday's Student Council meeting listed as the
first item under the heading "Report
on the Size of the College" as "given"
assumptions:
1. A report is a good idea. Size of
the College is the first issue to address. Our goal is a document representing general student opinion on
the size of the College in the future.
After a good hour and a half of
circuitous discussion about the principles behind creating such a report,
Alyssa Rayman-Read '99 began the
following dialogue regarding the
aforementioned item:
Rayman-Read: "That's what we
started with—we come in here and
we change it all around. Fine. That
happens every single meeting in
here...lt seems to me like right now,
once again, we're arguing about
things that aren't necessary to argue
about, and I wish that people would
look really seriously at the agenda
that we're given, and if they have a
problem with what has been given
that we're supposed to be discussing,
then we need to frame it in a way
that's better, so that our whole council meeting is not basically spent on
No. 1, like debating whether No. 1 is
going to happen or not, because No.
1 is what the rest of the questions are
about and we can't move from brainstorming to anything right now."
Sean Barney '9B, SC Co-coordina-

tor: "Actually, I'd amend what she
[Rayman-Read] said in a way: we
didn't even get to No. 1."
Rayman-Read: "It's not that we
didn't get to No. I,No. 1 is given.We
had a meeting where we talked about
this, and we said: "This is what we
want to do.'"
Will Nessly '99: "This is what's
frustrating the hell out of me."
As two people who have observed
several Student Council meetings of
late, we could not agree more with
Nessly. The current student council
modus operandiresults in this sort of
inaction week after week. We leave
the meetings, as I'm sure the members do, thinking about how much
prime Sunday night studying time
we've just wasted.
Before we launch into what we see
as the central problems with SC, a
few disclaimers: SC members are all
good people whodemonstrate a genuine desire to fulfill the duties of their
office. If only they knew what those
duties were. We are not attempting to
disparage their intentions, merely
offerconstructive criticism. We hope
that our observations will serve two
purposes: to reveal the problems preventing SC from becoming what we
believe could be an important and
productive force on this campus and
to suggest possible reforms toward
that end.
At first examination, the causes of
SC's paralysis seem diffuse and elusive. We feel, however, that the im-

potence of Student Council in all of
its manifestations stems from a single
central difficulty. Madison might
have called it factionalism, but perhaps that word has connotations inappropriate to SC's situation. We see
it instead as a lack of collective or
social consciousness on the part of
SC members. Such an awareness
wouldinformand regulate every comment and every action ofeach member—leading to a kind of internal
monitoring and filtering which asks
at every turn: "Is what I am about to
say helpful for the efficiency of this
council and, by extension, the student body as a whole?" Due to the
absence of this self-discipline, SC's
meetings become exercises in tangential micromanagement on one
extreme and deconstructionism on
the other; though both of these tendencies may be valid in principle, or
useful in the classroom, they prevent
SC from moving from abstract discussion to substantive action.
Now, we cannot expect every SC
member to assume this brand of objective self-control; politics breeds
self-importance and contentiousness,
attitudinal problems which, left unchecked, lead to paralysis at best,
despotism at worst. But we can expect SC, like every vaguely democratic government in human history,
to adopt procedural mechanisms that
focus their efforts.These mechanisms
are not complicated: discussion time
limits, proposal writing, amendment

procedures, voting rules, to name but
a few. The council might begin by
doing some research: seeking out effective governments and their methods of ensuring that something, usually something good, gets done.While
it might seem silly, because the scale
is obviously quite different, SC might
begin by looking at the U.S. Congress. While our federal legislature is
most certainly not perfect, they do
keep this country running. Any organization with a parliamentary procedure would do, from the U.N. to the
local Elks Lodge.
Obviously, these formalistic models are not applicable for responding
to smaller student concerns which
require less thought, more footwork.
SC has already arrived at a viable
system for this kind ofresponse: the
Council is divided into four work
groups, each assigned a set of tasks
derivedfrom student complaints. The
work of these groups should fulfill
the primary function of student government: to better the daily lives of
students in areas the administration
may not address. To truly perform
this service well, SC would have to
place its fingertip on the pulse of the
students. A heightened awareness of
student opinion will result in more
effective SC representation on College committees and a better understanding of their responsibilities, not
to mention increased student awareness of SC operations. Herein lies the
SC's only defense against apathy.

More Than the Home of the Scott Arboretum
By

Elizabeth Weber

If

you have ever walked by the Scott Foundation Offices, you've seen them. Atop
the otherwise unremarkable-looking
building, on the side facing Parrish, are a pair
of green observatory domes. These domes
are really the only remaining sign that the
building was once Cunningham Observatory; the Observatory housed not only the
Astronomy Department of the College, but
Swarthmore's first professor of astronomy,
Susan Cunningham.
Susan Cunningham had been a professor of
mathematics at the College since 1871, and
was involved with Swarthmorefrom its founding in 1864. By 1888, she was Mathematics
Department chair, and the Board of Managers gave her permission to build and equip the
building which now bears her name.
Cunningham lived in the building until her
retirement in 1906, when the new chair of
mathematics and astronomy, John A. Miller,
took up residence there. Swarthmore then
paid 100 dollars per year for rent to
Cunningham for the rest of her life, and upon
her death in 1921, Cunningham Observatory
became College property.
Miller wrote in a Popular Astronomy article describing Swarthmore's different astronomical resources: "This observatory is
only one of the expressions of the marked
influence this great woman and great teacher
has had, and in fact is having, upon the
college, for she still contributes not only from
her material resources, but gives her entire
strength and influence to the upbuilding of
the college."
Cunningham equipped her observatory with
a 6-inch equatorial refracting telescope, a
sidereal clock, a meantime clock, and a chronometer, Miller wrote. According to Professor of Astronomy Wulff Heintz, the refracting telescope was never used for astronomical research—it was one of a quality suitable
only for instruction, even in 1885.
In 1906, Cunningham persuaded William
Cameron Sproul to fund research quality astronomical equipment for Swarthmore. This
included a 24-inch telescope and additional
equipment housed in the new Sproul Obser-

SCF Promotes Christian Presence on Campus
By

Heather Weidner

With

a goal of serving God, the community, and the Swarthmore campus, it's no wonder that the members of the Swarthmore Christian Fellowship
(SCF) have their hands full.
Vanya Tepavcevic '97, the
prayer and community coordinator for SCF, estimates that
she spends an hour or more every day on various activities for
the group. As an officer, she not
only attends services, Bible
study, and prayer meetings, but
a weekly organizational meeting as well. Tepavcevic admits
that SCF is a big time commitment, but also feels that "being
a Christian is a great part ofmy
life at Swarthmore."
Many other people on campus seem to share Tepavcevic' s
enthusiasm. SCF has 30 active
members and a mailing list of

for a time of worship. In an effort to serve the
entire Swarthmore community in different
ways, Monday night prayer walks, daily
prayer meetings, and Bible study groups in
most of the campus dormitories are also arranged by SCF.

They are also discussing various ways to

that "being a Christian isn'tfor Sundays only,

that the Bible study groups are
a very unifying element of
SCF.
When asked to define SCF,

Koo would like SCF to be accessible to all
people on campus; as the new student coordinator, Koo tries to accomplish this by fostering an encouraging atmosphere for all students, particularly first-years. The Freshman
banquet, held before the Fall Formal, is especially for first-year members of SCF. At the
banquet, upper classmen will serve a meal to
first-years before continuing on to the dance.

An additional special SCF activity called
Roots has also been planned for first-year
students on Tuesday nights in Bond. Roots is
an opportunity for older students to share
their experiences of being a Christian student
at Swarthmore.
Marah Fortson '97, president of SCF, is
very excited about al! of the programs and
activities that SCF has planned for the rest of
the year. According to Fortson, SCF is always "striving to be a group that supports
Christians and upholds an absolute faith in
God without violating the principles ofSwarthmore."

John Baugh Speaks As Well As He Listens
By

Gabriel Cumming and
Rachel

John

McKnight

Baugh, Visiting Lang Professor of
social change, has spent much of his
time recently listening to other people
talk. As a linguistics researcher, Baugh has
studied the many consequences of the various ways in which people of different racial
backgrounds speak. However, we found that
Baugh listened unusually attentively to us as
well.
Rather than immediately focus on himself,
Baugh took several minutes to ask us who we
were (visiting swat students of intellectual
inquiry). Baugh seems to extend this very
genuine interest in others to everything that
he does.
Baugh originally thought that he was going
to be an accounting major as an undergraduate student. Upon taking a public speaking
class, though, he discovered that he had an
interest in the influence of racial dialects on
social relations. Baugh changed his plans and
went to graduate school at the University of
Pennsylvania to study linguistics with professor William Laßov.
Afterwards, he taught black studies and
linguistics here at Swarthmore from 19751979. He proceeded to teach for 10 years at
the University of Texas at Austin before
becoming a permanent faculty member at

Stanford University.
Baugh pointed out that the primary focus
for professors at Stanford is their research
rather than their teaching: "It's research that
pays the bills." As a result, Baugh has done
extensive research on housing development

marked on
how much

he has enjoyed the focus on teaching at Swarthmore. He has also enjoyed working with
the other members of the Linguistics Department, and encouraged us to take classes with
them!
When asked what his other interests were,

he said that his most important priority was
his family. "I really enjoy my family," Baugh
stated, noting that the move to Swarthmore
had been a family decision, affecting not only
his life but also that of his wife and three
children.
As a Lang professor of social change, Baugh
is sponsored by the Linguistics Department
to teach several classes about the "linguistic
consequences of slavery" and other "social
stratifications of linguistic diversity as it relates to policy issues in medicine, law," and
other areas. "I use tools of social science to
address issues of equity," he stated. This fall,
he is teaching a class called "Linguistics:
Strife and Schools;" next semester, Baugh
will teach a class on the evolution of AfricanAmerican English.
Baugh hopes that his research will help
people to understand existing prejudices better.

Our interview got sidetracked on the subject of affirmative action, and Baugh readily
shared his insight on the subject. "I've been
the recipient of affirmative action for a long
time," he acknowledged, but he also pointed
out that the system has both strengths and
weaknesses.
His solution? As Baugh explained in a
commencement speech at the University of
Nevada, his goal would be for every person to

make a sincere effort to help someone of a
different background than his or her own.
No matter what subject he discusses, Baugh
displays a remarkable intellectual curiousity
and sensitivity. He uses the knowledge that
he has gathered about the world's many inequalities in working towards eradicating

you smile your broadest, toothy, rabid dog
smile and let out a big "whoop" in greeting.
As you approach this person, though, you
realize that is in not, in fact, one of your
fellow collaborators in crime but a complete
stranger, an unknown homo sapien. And they
appear a bit frightened by your hearty welcome, so all you can do is look at your feet and
scurry past, hoping that they did not get a
clear enough view of your features to give to
the police.
I really hate that.
I would also like to apologize to the person
I scared the beegeebers out of last Monday
night on Parrish walk. Sorry.
Now, on to our story...
I know you're worried about the future.
Once Al Bloom smacks you on the butt with
that diploma and banishes you from this little
Garden of Eden, what are you going to do
with the rest of your life?
Like most Swatties, you are highly selective. You can't work just anywhere. You
have over $ 100,000worth of education, after
all. Unfortunately, you have no marketable

skills.
Well, if you're like me, and I know you are,
you have specific requirements before selecting your occupation. You must make enough
money to maintain yourself in the lifestyle to
which you have become accustomed. I'm
thinking at least $lOO,OOO per year.
You must be in an environment that is
intellectually fulfilling. You must be enriched
by those around you while enriching them in
return. You must have a comprehensive dental plan. Your workplace must be an environment that fosters your creativity. You cannot
be stifled by insignificant concepts like "right"
and "wrong," "correct" and "incorrect." But
most importantly, you must be able to lie.
So to you, young Swattie, I recommend
looking into the expanding field of television
broadcast meteorology. Yes, be all you can
be. Be a weatherman.
And before you get your skivvies all in an
uproar, I mean weatherwoman, too. It's just
that weatherwomen sounds really funny to
me. Too much alliteration. And if you say it
fast with an Elmer Fuddesque twang, it begins to sound like "wetter woman." Then
someone will wonder what she's wetter than,
and the whole conversation will just get too
silly. How are you ever going to get a job if
you don't stop being so goofy and start acting
like an adult?
Anyway, it seems to me that weathermen
are the only people, other than politicians,
who are able to lie to millions of people on a
daily basis, often two or threetimes a day, and
never have to apologize.
No, weatherman never has to apologize
after your fall picnic is ruined by golf ball

Center recovering from the compound fractures you acquired after he forgot to mention
that the paths that day would be slippery.
No, they never have to apologize after they
tell you that the day will be clear and sunny,
so you put your two pet snails, Slimy and
Blimy, outside to get some exercise before
you go to school only to find their drowned
carcasses molding on the lawn when you get
home from kindergarten. Not once have I
ever heard a weatherman say, "Oops! I really
messed up today's forecast. Sorry for giving
you pneumonia and murdering your snails."
Of course, maybe you do not feel comfortable with lying on such a grand scale or would
prefer a smaller, more intimate audience where
you would only be lying to one or two people
a day. Then, I would suggest to you the
esteemed position ofparent. Children believe

Restaurant Review

A Few Sensational Dishes Make Magnolia Cafe Worth It
By

Alice Stillman

This

restaurant is easy to miss on a dark
night. It is not quite on the corner of
16th and Locust, and there is little to
distinguish it from therest ofthe block. When
you finally pass through the strangely bluish
reception area, you catch yourbreath.
Inside, there is a warm, soft glow from the
chandelier. The abundance of mirrors makes
the dining room appear larger than it is. There
are large black-and-white pictures ofscruffy,
cheery, old men grinning down from the
walls. The people inside are dressed both
casually and elegantly, but everyone looks
comfortable.
"Would you like something to drink?" I
scan the list of beverages and decide to split
a small bottle of sparkling cider. Our waitress
is back in a flash, this time with a basket of
rolls and muffins. The blueberry and corn
muffins are fresh and warm, and I find myself

asking for more.
The menu has a lengthy appetizer list. The

mojo platter, jambalaya, and blackened
chicken fingers emphasize the restaurant's
Cajun flavor. Special asterisks next to certain
dishes direct you to a warning at the bottom
of the page: "Hot and spicy (like Yo Mama)."
I decide to opt for something less dangerous.
I remember that the hush puppies here are
tender little morsels offlavorful fried dough,
but I try the healthier goat cheese and sun
dried tomatoes instead. My companion orders the smoked trout. Both dishes are excellent, and the unusually large portion of goat
cheese surprises me. The goat cheese has a
tangy, creamy quality unlike the storebought
versions to which I am accustomed. The

smoked trout is very fresh; it is served with
delicate triangles of toast and onion, hardboiled egg, and capers as side dishes. The
appetizers are clearly one of the highlights of
the cafe.
The rest of the menu is somewhat disappointing after the appetizers. There are two
soups (gumbo and gazpacho), several salads,
a few Cajun chicken and seafood dishes, and
five simple pasta dishes. The compensating
factor is the price: most of themain dishes are
around $B.OO.
The delta duck salad is the star among the
salads. Breast of duck is charbroiled with
cajun seasoning, then served on a bed of baby
lettuces with a delicate orange poppy seed
dressing. Too often duck tastes dry or overcooked, but this one is succulentand cooked
to perfection; the dressing adds a light and
refreshing touch to the crisp, lacy pieces of
lettuce and the intense, smoky flavors of the
duck. The smoked turkey salad with Laura
Chennel goat cheese is also delicious, although it lacks the duck salad's striking balance offlavors. The rest of the salads are very
standard and do little to tease the imagination. The chicken salads are served either
"charbroiled" or "blackened," and the blackened shrimp salad has little to recommend it
besides a basil walnut lanch dressing. The
muffaletta salad looks more promisine since
it is served with golden raisin and pecan
bread.
Among the seafood dishes, the coconut
beer shrimp is the most enticing. The jumbo
shrimp are dipped in a beer batter, rolled in
coconut, and then fried until the coconut
forms a sweet, golden-brown shell. They
smell heavenly and taste sumptuous, although

By Emily Shartin

Emily: You dirty, rotten scoundrel!
Andy: You...Minnesotan!
E: Where did that come from?
A: It's just that the title of your movie,
Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, lends itself pretty
well to insults while the title ofmine, Mystery

lend itself much to anything, especially by
way of insults.
E: I still don't see where the Land of

A: Well Joel, the creator ofMST3K—note
how easily I can adopt the abbreviated pet

But Joel doesn't end up in the picture and
his replacement is a dullard. I want to give the
new guy his due, Mike I think his name is, but
I don't take easily to change.
E: Well, at least you still have good ol'
Crow, Tom Servo, and Gypsy in this one,
right? And talking far more crassly than
they're normally allowed to on TV, no less.
The movie is about a janitor who is shot
into space by a mad scientist, and made to
watch bad movies as part of a science experiment gone horribly wrong.
My only question is why did a fine TV
show about movies ever need to become a

A: It starts to make you dizzy when you
realize MST 3K is a movie about a TV show

E: It raises some interesting questions about

Swarthmore College String Quartet will be holding their first concert
of the year Friday night at 8 p.m. in Lang Concert Hall. A resident group
of advanced string players, its members this semester are Rebecca Sawai
'9B (violin), Sarah Marsh 'OO (violin), Julie Russo 'OO (viola), and Marc
Pasciucco '9B (cello). They also serve as principal players for the College
Orchestra and the Chamber Orchestra. They are supervised by James Freeman,
professor of music, who serves as the faculty adviser to the group.
The original Quartet was started in the early 1980s, and is funded by an
endowment by the late Frank Fetter '2O, Robert J. Fetter '53, Thomas W. Fetter
'56, and Ellen Fetter Gille in memory of his wife and their mother, Elizabeth
Pollard Fetter '25.
The scholarships are based entirely on musical ability, and cover all the
students' musical expenses, including private lessons provided by the College,
and transportation to various performances. The Elizabeth Pollard Fetter
Scholars (as the players are known) hold several performances on and off
campus every year. They also often participate in competitions.
Students are free to try and win a place in the Quartet. Through auditions held
at the beginning of each semester, they are free to challenge any of the existing
members. "The auditions were kind of a competetive process," said Sawai.
This way, the Quartet is always composed of the four strongest string players
in the College.
"I really enjoy being in the Quartet," said Sawai. "It's fun, and interesting...it's
great to be working with the different people."
In this evening's performance, the Quartet will be performing Antonin
Dvorak's Quartet in F major, "The American," as well as W.A. Mozart's
Quartet in D minor, K 421.

The

first ten minutes ofBaz Luhrmann's
new Romeo and Juliet explode in a
frenzy offrantic camerawork, fast cutting, gunplay, macho confrontation. A news
anchor introduces Shakespeare'sancient tale
of "star-crossed lovers" as though it were the
latest thing. In this case, it is.
Written off by the pundits as Shakespeare
for the MTV-generation, Romeo andJuliet is
an astonishing and deliciously operatic spectacle. Luhrmann, the maverick Australian
responsible for the equally over-the-top
Strictly Ballroom, does Shakespeare the profound homage of utter irreverence.The effect
of dropping the Bard's iambic pentameter
into the post-modern whirl of life in Verona
Beach, a pseudo-apocalyptic never-never land
of street-fighting and masquerade balls, is
startling and invigorating. Compared to the
staid formalism of conventional Shakespeare
(the performance of Richard 111 within Al
Pacino's recent Looking for Richard comes
immediately to mind), Luhrmann's exuberantly scattershot approach is exhilarating.
The film tries hard, probably too hard, but
you love it for the attempt.
This is one of the most decorated films in
recent memory: every shot is crammed with
kitsch —glowing Virgin Marys, devotional
candles. Verona Beach (really Mexico City)
is awash with free-floating pop culture
signifiers (many of them sly Shakespearean
references). The colors are bold, self-consciously unnatural, the lighting unabashedly
dramatic—blazing white light envelops
Romeo and Julietfor their first kiss; impossibly golden sunlight embraces them as they lie
together in bed; the glow of several thousand
candles illuminates their deathbed. Romeo
and Juliet is an explosion ofeye candy, sped
up for comic effect and slowed down for
grand drama. It's a great, mad pop funhouse,
more movie than any movie I've seen this
year.
What isn't immediately apparent, particularly in the film's ragged first quarter, is just
how much thought has gone into this threering circus ofwretched excess. Shakespeare' s
Romeo and Juliethas been produced so many
times, recycled and referenced in so many
contexts, that the original seems overly familiar, overdetermined, cheesy. Luhrmann
seizes onto that cheese and pushes it to its
illogical extreme, achieving a sort of glorious

self-consciousness. The ironic result is a rediscovery of the play itself, a sort of
reconnection through exaggeration.
Luhrmann pulls off the unexpected: he makes
you care about Romeo and Juliet. Reinvigorated, the story grabs you, sucks you into its
familiar passion play of young love, clan
warfare, and romantic martyrdom.
Luhrmann's hyperbole opens up a space in
which the play can breathe.
"Oh my God, he's so cute," oohed the
thirteen-something sitting a few rows behind
me, marking Leonardo DiCaprio's every appearance. DiCaprio—whose Romeo appears
to be the completion of his transformation
from junior method actor to 1990s James
Dean—is terrific, his beautiful boyish face
caught in close-ups variously smoldering,
beatific, and (late in the film) tormented.
Claire Danes matches him every step of the
way, rendering Juliet both a convincing 17year-old and a genuine tragic heroine. Romeo
and Juliet's scenes together are swooningly,
lushly romantic, playfully erotic, and believably youthful. Danes and DiCaprio register
as kids swept up in a love much bigger than
the both ofmem. Both actors downplay their
most famous lines (e.g. "Romeo, Romeo,
whereforeart thou?"), finding in Shakespeare
a relaxed, vernacular, and distinctively American tone. It works surprisingly well.
Luhrmann' s packrat imagination embraces
an almost infinite variety of performance
styles: from Harold Perrineau's flamboyant
Mercutio to Paul Verona's Godfatheresque
Fulgnio Capulet and John Leguizamo's
hissable Tybalt, the actors attack their roles
withrelish. Perrineau, blessed with the play's
best role, is wonderful—his performance is
simultaneously fabulous and biting, a perfect
representation of the film's careful extravagance. The übiquitous Pete Postleth waite
makes a vivid impression as the tattooed
Father Laurence. Only Dash Mikok's clunky
Benvolio, iambic pentameter tangled up in
blocky jaw, botches his lines.
Romeo and Juliet, officially William
Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, is the product of an exuberant, overheated imagination.
It's impossibly lush, gorgeously tacky, and
vividly alive. A collage ofbad ideas, it works
wonders. Tongue plastered to cheek, this
Romeo andJuliet gives the Bard exactly what
he deserves: passionate reinvention and rich
theatricality. It's as exciting a movie as we're
likely to see this year.

the X-Files, before Eraser, before Chain Reaction, there was an
other story of fiendish government
experimentations protected by brutal hit
squads. I speak, of course, ofMrs. Frisbyand
the Rats of NIMH, remade by Disney as The
Secret of NIMH.
This animated classic concerns the adventures of superintelligent rats, escapees from a
federal mind-enhancing program, attempting to survive on their own, avoiding
internecine strife and nasty feds. Meanwhile,
the gentle Mrs. Frisby, a field mouse whose
home is in danger of being plowed over,
enlists their help to save her family. It features action, adventure, and moral lessons
from rodents, complete with sword-fighting,

cat-baiting, and wisecracking crows. Fine
animation makes a for a success.
What was a simple science-fiction tale becomes a new-age morality play in Disney's
hands. The renegade rats, minor characters in
the original book, become far more important
as a source ofevil in the movie, contrasted to
the ancient wisdom of Nicodemus, guru of
the good rats. Mrs. Frisby gains some sort of
mystic power stone from the rats, which
allows her to use her powers of the heart, so
that with good intentions, anything can be
accomplished. All in all, these silly additions
do little for the film, but give it that Disney
sheen of happy, dopey fantasy.

Still, it's a compelling movie, charming
and sweet at times, sad and moving at others.

"What other family for the past twenty

Mrs. Selverian.

As a whole, the team had a remarkable
shooting night, hitting 43 percent from the
floor and a huge 70 percent from the free
throwline. Every player on the court contributed to the game's scoring. Lisl CochranBond '97 led paced the Garnet with 14 points.
On her heels, Holly Barton '99 added 13. Pia
Houseal '97 and Erin Greeson '99 were next
in line with six points each.
Cochran-Bond made all eight of her free
throw attempts. She was also the Garnet's top
rebounder, tallying three offensive and five
defensive boards. The team had 11 steals on
the night, with Jean Quinn '99 coming away
with three.

Widener outrebounded Swarthmore 42 to
29, mostly on the offensive boards. While
Swarthmore lead in defensive bounds 20 to
14, Widener had three times as many on the
offensive end.
"Things were a little rough at the beginning, but everyone showed a lot of improvement throughout the course of the scrimmage. I was very pleased with the team's
performance the last twenty minutes. It was a
great opportunity for us to examine our
strengths and weaknesses. Now we know
what we have to work on, and I am confident
that we will be ready for our first regular

"It was a great pleasure to watch both Art and
Greg in the same backfield. It was enjoyable
watching two brothers play together, but they
all played for fun, for the love of the game."
Mr. Selverian quickly noted that his sons
came to Swarthmore for the academics and
that he is extremely proud of them.
"Football, though very enjoyable, was only
a small part [of their experience]. They all
received a great education, and they all made
their own choice to come to Swarthmore, and
that is very important."
It's hard to believe, but even with his five
older brothers as alumni, Kurk felt no pressure to come to Swarthmore. "I thought there
would be pressure, but there was none,"

claimed Kurk. "I looked at all the schools,
and I chose the one I wanted to go to. My
parents made sure I had my own choice."
In fact, Kurk's younger sister Cindy, a
stellar athlete herself, is at Lehigh this fall.
"Swarthmore has become part of the family," said Mrs. Selverian. Swarthmore should
feel proud to be included.
Kurk stated that he "wore number 44 because my dad wore it in college. I wore
number 31 in high school because my brothers wore it in high school."
Asked ifthey will ever come back to watch

Women Ruggers Avert Disaster
Katie Jozwicki

By
&

The women's rugby team tackled their last
opponent of the season on Saturday at Bryn
Mawr. This was meant to be a home game
against University of Pennsylvania, but things
got messed up.
Sarah Cross' 99 helped avert disaster.S warthmore traveled to Bryn Mawr to play a
mixed team of a players from Millersville,
Bryn Mawr, and Swarthmore. The referee
referred to Swarthmore's opponent as "Motley" in between making passes at captain
Andrea Barnett '97.
Despite the fact that Bryn Mawr fielded
theirhighly skilled coach at fly half, Swarthmore trounced the "Motley" crew in a decisive win, 20-0.
The starting line-up for the all-Swarthmore
side finally came together and demonstrated
that their skills surpass those that theirrecord
(1-5) seemingly reflects.
The "Motley" side performed to the best of
their abilities given the thrown-together nature of their team. Certain players even filled
new roles on their "Motley" side. Katie
JozWicki '97 attempted to throw the ball in
(straight) for line-outs, a job usually performed by scrum half, Jen Philpott '97.
Cori Garrett-Goodyear '99 played on the
"Motley" side as a prop, and commented, "At
first, I was really frustrated because it was
like we were scrimmaging ourselves. But,
then, I got really into it and we all played
really hard rugby!"
The all-Swarthmore side was able to put
together a very strong back line for this game.
And even though the line composed of Beth
Vose '99, Barnett, Giuliani, Karli Watson
'97, CourtneyClark '9B, and Meghan Brennan
'OO was a new back line, they all connected
well. There was no doubt that the back line
had their best performance of the season, but
it was up to the forward pack to score.
The first try was scored in the first half by
Becky Snyder '9B on a shortrun offof a ruck.
Snyder picked up the ball and pushed her way
through the "Motley" players to touch it down
for five points. Snyder said, "Scoring in this
game was almost as good as scoring while I
was in Australia!"
Alexa Miller' 00, the rookie eight man who
has played A-side since her first game, finally
scored her first points. Early in the second
half, Millerwas able to drive the ball into the
try zone with the support of other forwards.
Miller then went face first into a significant
mud puddle and loved every minute of it.
Forward captain, Hanan Hussein '97, also
scored another try, her fourthof the season. It
was an emotional day for Hussein, who, with
tears in her eyes, told the team at the close of
the game, "Thanks for an incredible season.
I have loved playing with all of you."
Philpott scored the final points of the game
in the last few seconds when she pulled a

scrum half sneak from 10meters out ofthe try
zone. After sliding in to touch the ball down,
Philpott apologized to Barnett for not placing
the ball in better kicking range for the extra

points.

Barnett, in fact, missed all four conversions, despite the amorous referee's encouraging words. Barnett later said, "I was very

impressed with the whole team that day. Our
scrum half, Jen Philpott, in particular, had an
awesome game."

It is a tradition in rugby for all players who
score for the first time in an A-side game to
become Zulu Warriors (ask a rugger for details, if you are interested). Vose, Miller, and
Snyder had the honor of warriorship this
season. Vose and Miller were initiated on
Saturday, but Snyder will have to wait until
next season.
Speaking of next season, rugby is also
played in the spring. All are welcome to come
give it a "try."

Swarthmore's men's and women's swim
teams raced to their first dual meet victories
on Wednesday at Beaver College. The final
results were impressive as each team won by

a margin of over 60 points.
The freshmen demonstrated their prowess,
collectively winning seven events, while upperclassmen took most of the rest. All in all,
the first dual meet acted as a warm-up fof a
long season and an opportunity to see how
well workouts are paying off thus far.
Plunging into the icy water from an overheated deck area, the swimmers overcame
shock and muscle tension to turn out some

Although their game last Saturday fell through, women's rugby had a full scrimmage
against a team made of players from Bryn Mawr, Millersville, and Swarthmore. They
even gave Sharpies a sampling of their vocal talents on their return home.

Season Ends for Men's Soccer
Despite loss against Haverford,
team is still optimistic about the
upcoming season
By

Shulamit Shapiro

The season is finally over for the men's soccer team.

Unfortunately, Saturday's season finale against Haverford
was a game to forget.
"The Haverford game was a disaster. They won 4-0.
We played well, but we didn't capitalize on opportunities
that we should have," said co-captain Kyle Barnett '97,
who was forced to sit out the game with an injury.
Barnett also felt that the team was overwhelmed by the
pressure to beat its archrival.
"It was a real emotional game. There was a lot of
pressure on us to win, there was a big crowd, and it was
our last game," Barnett reflected.
He also felt that once the Haverford team gained its
momentum, the Garnet team lost its grounding.
"Once a team starts getting goals, it just tends to run
away with the gameand the other team can't really get it

back," he said.
In addition to Barnett, the team lost two players during
the game. Both Scott Samels '99 and Jed Lewis 'OO
received red cards after an ugly incidentand were ejected
from the game. The two will also have to sit out next
season's opener.
Despite this loss and the fact that the team didn't win
as many games as it would have liked to this season,
Barnett is optimistic about next season.
"We had a really strong freshman class. There are a lot
of younger players who are really good, and I would
expect a much better season next year," said Barnett.
Next season's captains are James Chen '9B, Matt
Halpern '9B and Mike Schall '99. In addition, there will
be several team members who will be returning to play
after studying abroad.
"I think that the players will be very dedicated to
training in the off-season. The results of this season will
encourage them to train hard for next season," he said.
Barnett and the other seniors will reflect on the season
with fond memories. "When you ask yourself why you
play soccer at Swarthmore, I would say that [the reason
why is that] it's a great group of guys. I like to play the
gameand to hang out with other guys who also enjoy the
game. It's nice to win, but I'm just doing it to have fun."

What's In Store
for Swat B-Ball
By

David Lischer

What attracts basketball players to Swarthmore?There is no single answer, but together the
responses by this year's rookies reveal how good
a job the coaching staff does selling the Swarthmore experience.
Coach Lee Wimberly has built a strong program in his 10 years at Swarthmore. Together
with assistant coaches Brad Hofmann and Kirk
Daulerio, he manages to recruit in all 50 states.
This year's squad boasts players from California
to Texas and Maine.
Four recruits at the guard position join this
year's squad. They include two from Pennsylvania, J.T. Haskins 'OO and JoeCulley 'OO, one from
New Jersey, Gregg Holtmeier 'OO, and one from
Wyoming, Cassidy Westbrook 'OO.
Joining them in the rookie ranks are forward
Ford O'Connell 'OO and guards George
Rosenbaum 'OO and Bob Mack '99.

"The vigorousness of hitting the books is such

have great leadership qualities, and T feel lucky to be here for their last vcar," said Culley.
Holtmeier, too, was impressed by the people he met. "The guys were really cool. That was the biggest
factor for me [to come to Swarthmore]," he said.
Although Westbrook spent four nights at Swarthmore last Spring during finals week, perhaps the most
depressing time of the year, he enrolled. Westbrook was also looking at engineering schools closer to home,
but the quality of Swarthmore and the opportunity to create his own major prevailed.
Haskins noticed similarities between his high school program and the Swarthmore program. "In high
school, we played man-to-man, and Coach Wimberly usually plays that. Also we pressed all the time, and
Coach Wimberly says he likes to press and run where possible," he said.
Culley, too, appreciates the Swarthmore program. "Coach stressed that there were no prima donnas in the
program. This [appeals to me] because I've always worked really hard for everything I have," said Culley.
Two of the rookies have been sidelined with injuries. Haskins suffered a linear fracture of his femur during
the summer and is undergoing an aggressive rehabilitation that could get him back on the court in December
or January.
Rosenbaum sprained the MCL in his right knee during a short stint with rugby this Fall. An MRI recently
confirmed there was no tear, but his recovery has been slow.
None of the rookies are projected to break into the starting lineup this season, but with six seniors slated
to graduate, they will make important contributions early in their careers.

The Tide was finally able to mount
a scoring drive against the Terror in
the fourth quarter. The final minutes

of the game, including this score,
were highlighted by the play of reserve quarterback J.P.Harris '99, who
will most likely take over the starting

Tournament Preparation

Takedown Tourney
By

Matt Kahn

After three grueling weeks oftraining, the Swarthmore wrestling team
is hosting the eighth annual Swarthmore Takedown Tournament Saturday at 10 a.m.
Unlike the normal wrestling format, this preseason tournament is
comprised of three-minute, one-period matches, in which the wrestler
seeks to take his opponent down to
the mat as many times as possible.
When a takedown occurs, the referee brings both men back up to their
feet again. Each takedown is worth
one point, and if a wrestler takes his
opponent down and exposes the man' s
back to the mat, he is awarded two
points.
At the end of the three minutes, the
wrestler with the most points wins.
The tournament follows a round-robin
format, and the two wrestlers with
the bestrecords in their weight classes
wrestle in the final matches for first
place.
Last year, Peteßalvanz '9B, who is
abroad this semester, took second
place in his weight class. There will
be ten teams at this year's competition, including some Division I
schools.
Despite the tough competition,
Swarthmore looks to do well in a
number of weight classes. Nick
Attanasio 'OO (118 pounds), Aaron
Kobernick 'OO (142), and Alejandro
Montero 'OO (177) will make their
collegiate wrestling debuts, and have
good chances of upsetting perennial
favorites like Gloucesterand Ursinus.

Captains Adrian Wilson '99 (134)
and Scott Timm '99 (150) should
place in their respective classes. Wilson was particularly impressive at
last year's tournament, winning his
first three matches, one by a score of
15-0.
"I'm very excited to be wrestling,
especially after missing half of last
year due to injuries. We may be a
very young team, but we've got a lot
oftalent, and I think that will show on
Saturday," said Timm.
This particular tournament, with
its uncomplicated format and scoring
system, is the best one for Swarthmore athletic fans who are unfamiliar
with wrestling to attend.

the day. Because of the offensive woes, the
defense found themselves on the
field for a total of 99 plays—well
above the number for an average
game.
The Terroralso surprised the Tide
by coming out in a no-huddle formation to go with their potent and
quick run and shoot offense. The
Tide, however, tried to make the
most of this situation and produced
some impressive statistics.
Joaquin Sanchez '99 played an
outstanding game in recording 11
tackles, one interception and a
fumble recovery. Chris Fowler '97
lead the team with his 15 tackles.
The Tide finish their season this
weekend by hosting the Washington & Lee Generals on Clothier
Field at 1:00 p.m. This will be the
Tide's final shot to avoid finishing
with the school's first winless season since 1974.
Last season, the Tide won a 2-0

The '96-'97 Swarthmore women's
basketball team made a successful
debut against Widener College in
last Friday's preseason contest. The
informal gamewas played as five 10minute periods, of which the Garnet
won two and lost by only one or two
points in the other three. The prevalent attitude among team members
and coaches was that it was a fine
opening to a promising season.
WidenerCollege tookthefirst three
periods from a Garnet squad that
seemed shaky and flustered. Soon
Swarthmore regained composure and
dominated the floor with superior
shooting and intense defense.
