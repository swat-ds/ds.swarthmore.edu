Students Enter into
Controversy Around
Calif Proposition 187
By Brenda Arellano

On Sunday, Nov. 13, a group of
concerned Latino students met to discuss theirreactions to the passing of
California's Proposition 187, "AntiImmigration Law." In an effort to
bring awareness to Swarthmore's
campus about theproposal, the group
put up a collage of articles and facts
concerning the proposition, hoping
to inform the community, encourage
discussion, and advertise the panel
session which was to be held by faculty about the proposal. Controversial articles and signs were also posted
around campus.Some students
painted their face with a slashed 187
to show their opposition.
Chris Marin, '96, co-president of
HOLA, felt Proposition 187 was pertinent to Swarthmore because "this is
a humanitarian concern, and not just
a Latino issue. This raises the issues
of racial tensions," he says, "which I
think should concern everyone."

On Tuesday, November 15, Swarthmore students participated in a candlelight vigil commemorating the fifth
anniversary of the killing of six Jesuit priests and two workers from the University of Central America inEl
Salvador. Other events included a screening of the documentary, "A Question of Conscience," about the
murders, and a lecture by Hector Samour, a professor from the University of Central America.

The normally quiet Budget Committee deliberations over the selection of a new Treasurer for 1995
erupted into a controversy which
threatens to undermine the normal
functioning of the Budget Committee and highlights the need to address
the ways in which members of the
Swarthmore community interact.
On Sunday, November 13, meetings were scheduled to select a new
Treasurer from among candidates of
Tony Cheesebrough '97, Allen
Dupree '96, and Tanisha Little '97.
Although theTreasurer is not allowed
to vote on the committee, s/he exerts
influence by setting the"total amount
offunds available" in any particular
week, according to Committeemember Marcella Nunez-Smith '96. In
this way, the Treasurer establishes
the framework under which committee members apportion funds.
According to Nunez-Smith, dur-

ing discussion of the candidates,
Andrew Petusky, '95, the lastperson
to speak, prefaced his comments by
saying that "he was uncomfortable
with the dynamics of the Budget
Committee." He expressed his belief
that the Committee "was making decisions unwisely, without thinking
about them...[when] apportioning
money to groups,"Nunez-Smith said.
He said that he could be completely
honest because, as a senior, he would
not be subject to re-election.
What ensued was what Petusky
said was an attempt on his part "to
make sure that the Budget Committee was responsible, prudent, and fair
in its decisions to allocate funds to
StudentActivities funds." It became,
however, aheated exchange in which
feelings were hurt and issues were
raised which may have implications
far beyond the Budget Committee.
According to Committee member
Alisha Pennix '97,however, Petusky
stated that "time and again, he wit-

Tri-College Africa Conference Will
Examine Democratic Developments
By Melissa Jacobs
A conference focusing on issues of
democracy in Africa will be held this

weekend on both the Swarthmore
and Haverford campuses. The twoday symposium, entitled Democracy
in Africa: Challenges Ahead, will
discuss the move towards democratizationwhich Africa has been
experiencing since the end
M
of the Cold War.
The conference is a Jfj
collaborativeeffortof the
Swarthmore African Stu-™"™'
dents' Association (SASA)
and the Swarthmore Political Sc

ence Department, with additior

support from the Education E
partment. It will offer serious,

depth examination of the political™
and economicrealities facing Africa,
along withcultural events like Friday
night's Ethiopian Dinner Buffet, and
Saturday night's African Jam.
Political Science Professor
Raymond Hopkins says the subject
of democracy and its development in
Africa is increasingly in focus in
Africa and abroad. With the end of
the cold war and the collapse of communism, Hopkins says authoritarian
regimes now face "an eroded rationale" for their existence. He points
out that not all African nations approach democracy the same way.

Whereas inKenya the president suddenly instituted multiple party elections inresponse to the threat of withheld donations unless they were held
a relatively peaceful transformation
to democracy in South Africa seems
to be taking place. As changes in
Africa effect us on a global level, the
conference hopes to raise issues sue]
as external control, autonomy an<
he authenticity of home grown
lemocracy. "brary"Democracy
doesn't have to look like the
States," Hopkins

Wsaid,

"but...it needs to re

r fleet a human dignity which
is unique to a culture." Profes
sor Steven O'Connell, o
Swarthmore's Economics De

tions of "good-governance, a cur

"sustainability" are ripe for being
discussed because there is "so much

Conference at Princeton Focused
on Fostering US-Israel Relations
By Shulamit Shapiro
Students from colleges and universities as
diverse as Georgetown, Yale, Brandeis, Yeshiva and Swarthmore gathered at Princeton
University on November 6 to attend an AIPAC
Regional Political Leadership Training Seminar, which focused on fostering cooperation
between the United States and Israel.
AIPAC, which stands for American Israel
Public Affairs Committee, defines itself as "a
non-partisan, grassroots, membership organization of citizen activists who feel strongly
about the importance of a solid US-Israel alliance and support thatconviction with meaningful action." It functions as a lobbying mechanism and "works day in and day out with
Congress and the US Administration to advance the US-Israel relationship. Its staff attends hearings and committee
mark-ups that bear on that
relationship...The lobby provides vital, timely information to members of Congress,
the Administration, political
candidates and a national network of grassroots activists."
Activism on college campuses comprises an integral
part of AIPAC's grassroots
efforts. The organization encourages students to become political activists.
It helps students to work for pro-Israel candidates and causes, and to foster awareness of
Israeli political issues on their campuses. AIPAC
also facilitates student action in Washington,
DC. It offers undergraduates and graduates
who want a political career the opportunity to
participate in countless internships in its regional offices throughout the United Statesand
in its national headquarters in Washington
through its Political Leadership Development
Program.
The conference atPrinceton was geared both
towards students who are campus activists and
aspire to higher political goals, and to those
who are simply interested in the current issues.
Students were addressed by Steve Grossman,
the president of AIPAC. He was present at the
September 13,1993 signing of the Declaration
of Principles between Yasser Arafat, the president of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, and Yitzhak Rabin, the PrimeMinister of
Israel. He was also present at the October 26,
1994 signing of the peace treaty between the
Israeli government and King Hussein of Jordan. He described his experiences dealing directly with the leaders of the various countries
involved.
Grossman also outlined some of the issues
that are currently most crucial to AIPAC. First
of all, AIPAC wants to ensure that the loan
guarantees that the United States made to Israel
are maintained. Grossman stressed thereciprocal importance of these guarantees. According
to AIPAC, 85% of the $3 billion loans promised to Israel were the result of what workers
produced in the United States. Thus the extension of loan guarantees improves our own
economy by creating many high-tech and high-

paying jobs.
Anotherkey issue for AIP AC is expansion of
the economic partnership between the United
States and Israel. Israel's Gross Domestic Product is $7O billion, and it is a world leader in six
top technical fields. Given that Israel has
achieved this level of economic success despite
its constantpoliticalunrest, its small geographical size (the equivalent ofNew Jersey) and that
it has only been recognized by 146 countries,
AIPAC feels that it is an important ally in the

global economy.

Finally, Grossman addressed the issue of
security. AIPAC strongly supports maintaining Jerusalem as the capital of the state of
Israel. The organization also wants Arafat to
take action beyond condemnationof the violent
acts of the terrorist group, Hamas. Furthermore, the committee is concerned about the
level of US military intervention in the Golan
Heights.

the current Middle East peace process.
Participants then heard about the political
events regarding Jordan, the country to sign a
peace treaty with Israel most recently- David

Sloan of George Washington University discussed "Jordan: Peace in our Time." The Editor-in-Chief of the Jordanian Student Voice,
Abed-Elsalam AlNaser, addressed the group
fromhis perspective as a Jordanian in favor of
peace with Israel.
The focus of the conference then shifted to
local and campus activism. Students broke into
groups based on their college's location to
discuss the then upcoming elections. The facilitators encouraged last-minute action for
pro-Israel candidates. They also stressed the
importance of writing letters to the winning
members of Congress, congratulating them on
their victories and reminding them of the importance of issues related to Israel.
Workshops on student involvementincluded
"Caucus Building: The Campus and Community Working Together," "Starting a Pro-Israel
Group on Campus," "Programming for Peace:
Keeping Your Pro-Israel Group Active in A
New Era," and "Running for Office Yourself."
All of the day's workshops were run by AIPAC
officials, students, and professionals in
academia, politics and the media.
The conference ended with a session entitled, "Pounding the Pavement: Finding a Career That's Right for You." Speakers described
different jobs in which they could manifest
both their interest in politics and their desire to
foster healthy and positive relations between
the United States and Israel.

have not been decided.
Durkan is hoping that funds can be found to
build an annex onto McCabe in the near future.
He is concerned about maintaining a library
that adequately addresses the needs of an ever
expanding collection, user seating, staff space
and new technology. Unfortunately, he says,
many of the technological advances have come
at the expense of user space and that much of
the equipment such as the microfiche and the
video classroom, have not been "designed decently and lack the space for good use."
Durkan says computer technology is creating an interdependent network of libraries nationwide with database searching and digitized
texts and feels that it is important to keep
Swarthmore up-to-date. The Swarthmore libraries currently offerboth CD-ROM and online
electronic database search services, and are
linked to a fully automated tri-college system
(TRIPOD) with Bryn Mawr and Haverford.
McCabe is about to embark on a project
funded by the MellonFoundation in which five
colleges have been chosen to subscribe to ten
journals in economics and history which have
been put in electronic form and placed on a
computer network, with the illustrations, tables,
and graphs included. This project is aimed at
determining the success of texts delivered on

of their collections off-campus this year.
Each year the Swarthmore College library
holdings increase by 20,000-30,000 volumes.
Over the years, McCabe library has accommodated for this growth by rearranging collections and taking over study spaces. There were
originally nine lounges in McCabe and now
threeremain. The video classroom and equipment on the fourth floor replaced a lounge, as
did the micro-fiche and micro-film equipment.
The most recent shift occurred last year. To
provide space for the growing collection of
bound periodicals the Honors shelves were
moved from the third floorup to the fourthfloor
taking over an open study space. The computers lining the wall remain but the tables were
removed to make room for shelving.
Michael Durkan, head of the Library Committee, said that this last expansion will yield
space for five years' growth all around in
McCabe but expressed concern over the future
of McCabe after that time. He said that the
college is "sympathetic to the library'spredicament" but cannot provide any funding at the
present time due to the Trotter/North campus
project Provost Jennie Keith said the College
Planning Committee will review space use on

network and will ultimately decide the fate of
bound periodicals. This system should be operational sometime in 1995 and Durkan foresees, "exciting times ahead for the delivery of
text."
As technology changes, the space needs of
the library change in order to accommodate the
innovations. Larry Schall, Vice President of
Facilities and Services, said that expansion of
the library is definitely "something we will get
to" but that it is a "complex subject because of

Students Organize for Regional Action Against Proposition 187
By Tamar Charry

Following the panel discussion of
Proposition 187 of Tuesday November 15, about 30 students remained
behind to plan for mobilization
against it This meeting was a preparatory measure for theformation of a
coalition, which they would like to
see involving not only Swarthmore
students, but also students throughout the East coast.

The group decided that the coalition, which is tentatively named the
Coalition Against Xenophobia, will
involve all possible Swarthmore student organizations.M any groups have

been contacted, and, according to
coalition organizer Kevin Keenan
'95, almost all have agreed toparticipate. In addition, the group has started
to contact groups at many schools as
possible. The hope is that S warthmore
will serve as the East coast base for
the movement in opposition to Proposition 187,which is intended to prevent undocumented immigrants from
obtaining education, non-emergency
medical, and other services from the
state of California.
The Coalition was inspired by activities in California, where students
of the Claremont Graduate School
areorganizing groups throughout the

said, "You go on, girl, get yourself that
money" in an informal discussion. Petusky
alleged that this made "it a more comfortable
atmosphere for her" than was enjoyed by other
students who came before theCommittee. Green
insists that "it wasn't like I was saying "'We're
going to give her all the money she wants
because we're friends.'"
Another incident involved a request by the
SASS treasurer for $l5 to pay for supplies,
since money had not been set aside in SASS'
budget for supplies. A consensus was reached
that the money would be granted, even though
Green asserts that "the vote was taken without
me even being in the room." Petusky said that
none of the other African-Americancommittee
members decided to abstain.
According to Pennix, this was in violation of
an agreement made earlier in the year that each
member would decide on a case-by-case basis
whether or not his or her voting on a matter
to have

represented a conflict of interest, and that no

other member of the Committee wouldcall that
decision into question. Yee said that it would
basically function "as an honor system."

The Swarthmore group proposes
to hold its first formal meeting on

Sunday at 10:30 in the CRC on the
second floor of Parrish. It will be an
open, democratic "general session,"
which will be facilitated by seven

declaration of "opposition to proposition 187 on the grounds that it is

tion that want will be involved.
The meeting will also organize the

support network necessary" in the first place.
Because this support network is, by nature,
exclusive, itraises questions aboutBC funding
of groups not open to all students. Committee

member Phil Spector, however, "cannot recall
one opportunity in which a support group was
detrimentally treated due to its support group
status."
According
to

Yee, "his

concerns
weren't directed specifically at

SASS...he
felt

that

the Budget
Committee]
who are too
involved in other groups should abstain whenever that group comes before the Budget
Committee."And Spector believes that "while
he [Petusky] may have explicitly or implicitly
referred to cases of impartiality on the part of
specific members, he never asserted that race

was an issue."
Towards the end of what had become a very

that they are for SASS. Pennix resents the fact
that Petusky apparently "saw black skin, and

Smith claims that"he [Petusky] really doubted
the ability of black people to be impartial."
Thus when Green said "by your criteria [as
SASS Vice-President] I shouldn't even be on
this committee," Petusky replied that "maybe
you shouldn'tbe on the committee," according
to Pennix.
Bennett remarked that "if she were captain of
the hockey team, if she were Board Member of
the Women's Resource Center, or involved
with MAGIC, this wouldn'tbe an issue." In this
way, she remarks, "students get penalized for
their participation in a support network, which
creates an environment which makes [such a]

gentile on this Committee," which he believecT
to be strange given the fact that members of this
classification describes a majority of students
on campus. Choe decided at this point to move
towards a selection of a new treasurer, even
though Pennix, Kimberly Jefferson '96, and

Nunez-Smith believe that they never had the
opportunity to discuss the candidates in depth.
Choe explains that Little was selected as the
new Treasurer, and this decision will stand
unless appealed. Student Council, not Budget
Committee, would be responsible for deciding
the outcome of any appeal. Yee remarked, "I
thought I chose the best person for the job."
Little believes that her interview "went well"
and that the sentiments underlying the tension
which developed had not been evident to her at

system "pits students against other students" in
a competition for money. He would prefer a
system in which students solicited funds from

While Bennett feels that Swarthmore has
done a good job of creating "safe spaces where
students [of ethnic, religious, or sexual minorities] can explore within their own group what it
means to be an 'other' in this society," she also
considers it necessary to examine "underlying
assumptions" of different students about "who
is qualified to represent the Swarthmore community."
In an attempt to establish a space in which
members of the larger community may effectively grapple with issues together, a series of
discussions are expected to commence in December, which will presided over by faculty

Nobody's Laughing in
Theater Department
By Morgan Phillips
Anyone who has attended a recent
dramatic production here at
Swarthmore knowsthatthereis something seriously wrong with the Theatre Department. Every show is an
experiment: Will it work? Will the
actors be able to pull it off? Will the
audiencebe able to sit through it? It's
time to stop all of this experimentation. Theatre people are primarily
entertainers. Don' t entertainershave
a responsibility to entertain?
As a Theatre major, I'm force-fed
a great deal of useless garbage. We
spend hours and hours discussing
imaginary things like 'dramaturgy'
and 'the ongoing life of the character.' We're forced to learn all about
brooding, boring people like Brecht
and Aristotle. And when we finally
get to try things out on stage, we're
encouraged tocreate unapproachable
pieces of arty confusion. Audiences
walk out of the LPAC scratching
their heads and say:' 0 "That sure
was, urn, interesting." If they weren't
so polite, they'd say what they were
really thinking: "That sure was pretentious and incomprehensible.
What's wrong with those Theatre
weirdos?"
Even when Theatre students make
an attempt to put on a show that
people will enjoy, the finished product is always a ponderous, pompous
mess. A few semesters back, one of
my fellow Theatre majors decided to
put on the hauntingly beautiful rock
opera, "Jesus ChristSuperstar." Here
was a very approachable story and
score by one of the undisputed mas,

ters ofmodem theatre, Andrew Lloyd
Weber. But could the student director leave well enough alone and give
people the sort of theatre experience
that they wanted and expected? Of
course not. He somehow felt it necessary to throw in a lot of moody
lighting and scenery and a ballet involving animal masks. Many audience members showed up expecting
a nice musical, and saw a disturbing
spectacle that made them feel uncomfortable. The campus erupted in
controversy. The production was a
complete artistic failure.
Sometimes I think that my fellow
Theatre students are only interested
in seeing how far they can push accepted theatrical conventions. Ifother
people like what they do, that's fine.
Ifthey don't, that's equally fine. It's
almost as if they don't care about
whether or not their audience enjoys
itself. What's the pointof theatre if it
doesn't base itself on what audiences
want to see? In the real world, theaters depend on ticket revenues to
survive. If you don't give people
what they want to see, they won't
give you any money, and you'll have
to get a real job.

...Or Real Conflicts of Interest?
To the Editor:
Budget Committee (BC) is a 10
member student-council-appointed
organization whose responsibility it
is to distribute StudentCouncilfunds
to chartered Student Council clubs
and organizations. BC allocates over
$250,000 each year. These funds
come directly out of students' pockets—nearly $2OO per student per semester. This fee is not covered by
any financial aid. Although BC resources seem large, the demand for
these funds is much greater. Thus it
is of utmost importance that funding
is conducted in as fair, objective and
prudent a manner as possible. Decisions regarding allocations are

of two-thirds in orderforBC toact; an
ambiguous situation could arise if
three or more BC members belonged
to a group which was petitioning BC
for funds. A second perceived shortcoming of this proposal was that it
was unfair that BC members would
have to abstain from BC participation
due to other affiliations, because not
all members of organizations are involved to the extent that their objectivity would necessarily be significantly impaired. This is especially
important for

This

semester,

impartiality has

been a major concern of many BC

members. The topic was addressed
earlier in the semester, but no concrete conclusions were reached. Recently the topic was raised anew, but
discussions only resulted in misunderstanding and hostility between
various BC members.
When the topic was addressed earlier this semester, it was suggested
thatBC membersaffiliated withother
clubs or organizations recuse themselves from thedecision-making process when their clubs or organizations come before BC. This proposal
was rejected by a majority of BC
members, who cited that it was unfeasible as well as unfair. One flaw
identifiedby members concerned the
fact that BC rules require a quorum

ship is automatic
Thus BC found themselves at an
impasse. Yet a feasible and fair solution is possible. This solution lies in
focusing on the degree to which a BC
member is involved in a another club.
Measuring such involvement is difficult because it is largely subjective;
however a more practical, less vague
criterion, would be torequire current
as well as recent officers of clubs and
organizations to recuse themselves

from BC discussions when BC is
dealing with their respective clubs.
This rule would not necessarily be
binding—rather BC should maintain
the option of allowing members with
such clearly strong affiliations to participate on approval of other members.

Concerns about conflicts of interpartiality, and even bias of BC
members are nothing new. In previous semesters, other BC members
have been troubled by this as well.
Moreover, Student Council is conscious of the possible negative consequences of partiality and bias. The
StudentCouncil Appointments Committee specifically asks each applicant to BC how they would react in
situations where their impartiality
might be compromised. In fact, this
issue is of such importance that it is
directly addressed in the Rules Governing Budget Committee section of
theStudent Activity Fund Rules (Section F, Article 17), which states, "If a
member should feel that his/her objectivity on an issue pending action
before Budget Committee might become excessively impeded, the member will as a matter of course remove
her/himself from deciding on the issue." Unfortunately these preemptive measures have not proved effective. It is our hope that the above
proposal will contribute toresolving
this issue.

Open Forum: Immigration and California's Prop 187
187 Signals Need
Xenophobia Alive in
for Change in CA

the Golden State

By Arthur Krause

ates Californians who
are supposed to pay-

On November Bth, I was one of
many Californians who went to the
polls and voted overwhelmingly in
favor of Proposition 187, a measure
aimed at reducing state services to
illegal immigrants. I voted for the
measure not because I believe it to be
a great law, but because I believe it
will send a message to the Federal
government that it is time to enforce
our nation's immigration laws.
The Federal government has an
obligation and right to regulate immigration and it should act to prevent
violationsof our borders. On the other
hand, the Federal and state governments have no duty to provide social
services to citizens of other nations.
If citizenship means anything, it
means that there is a distinction be-

ing for this aid.
Illegal immigration,
also exacerbates serious monetary problems in cash-starved
California. It is esti-

tween the responsibilities a government has to its own citizens and to
those who are citizens of other nations. Our government has an obligation to aid and protect those who are

citizens and legal residents of this
country, not citizens of other nations.
Legal immigration and illegal im-

migration are not the same thing. We
are willing to assist those who respect our laws and ask for the opportunity

the same services. For example, an
estimated 400,000 illegal alien students are in our public schools, contributing to the already-serious problem of overcrowding. But it also detracts from the education received by
others, especially legal immigrants
who are likely to be in the same ESL
classes. Because California has large
budget deficits and dwindling social
services, it is unfair to take away aid
from those who need it and give it to
those here illegally.
Moreover, illegal immigrants are
open to exploitation because they are
not protected by minimum wage and
labor protection laws. Employers favor illegals because they are willing
to work for very little and have no

California inparticular. The best way
to deal with this problem would be to
openly acknowledge the forces that
contribute to illegal immigration.
Currently, there is a system of winks
and nods in which the government

immigration, and then does not enforce them in order to please those
who wish to employ low-wage labor.
This system cheats taxpayers who
are forced to support these people
and it cheats the immigrants who are
made vulnerable to exploitation.
The government should change
immigration law to permit more migrant workers to legally enter the

nation in pursuit of low-wage jobs
which would make it possible for
them to be protected by laborlaws. In
fact, many Mexicans do not even
wish to live in the United States but
come only to find work. If the problem were dealt with openly thepublic
could decide what trade-off to make
between the benefits of low-wage
labor and the costs of large-scale
immigration.

By Ben Thomases

If we carefully examine the objections thatmany people raise against 187,
we find a difficult situation. Many people believe it is morally wrong to
deprive people of essential services because they are in the country illegally.
Their point is especially powerful when we take the example of children
deprived of health care and education because they came here illegally.
However, if we do provide illegal immigrants with a moderate level of
services, we are essentially rewarding people for creatively breaking our
laws. I imagine that many consider the reward of having their children
educated in American schools and treated in American hospitals wellworth
all of the risks of illegal immigration. And, if we combat this problem only
at theborder, then we are essentially turning it into a high stakes game: avoid
the border guards and you're in, no questions asked.
Nonetheless, most people feel that 187 is unjust. What is really at issue here
is that we are not really comfortable with our immigration laws. We can live
with them in theirpositive form: only a certainnumber of people are allowed
to move to America. However, when taken to their logical conclusion in
Proposition 187, they are unbearable.
Eliminating our restrictions on immigration is not a plausible solution.
Even if our economy couldhandle the strain ofunlimited immigration, other
aspects of immigration would still be problematic. Illegal immigration is an
issue because there is great demand for people who will work long hours at
low, often below minimum, wages. Thus, from cleaning ladies and nannies,
to farm and factory workers, illegal immigrants are an important part of our
workforce. People will continue to work in these jobs,even though itis illegal
to do so.
Essentially, there is no acceptable solution to this problem. It appears that
Californians have lost patience and made a grave mistake. Some attempt to
excuse the people of California by saying that they passed 187 more as a
demand for action then as an acceptable solution. If so, it was yet another
highly irresponsible act by the electorate. California's voters have the fairly
unique privilege of enacting legislation by referendum, and they have
misused it.
It is almost as if Californians did not believe that theyreally had the power
to enact legislation. Many who voted for the proposition assumed that it
would be overturned in the courts, or simply remain unenforced. Instead it
appears distinctly possible that it will be enforced at great cost and with little
benefit Yet, regardless of whether or not 187 is ever applied, we will be no
closer to a solution for the problems posed by illegal immigration.

by working in a soupkitchen, sharing
an orange or a muffin, or extending a

Tears of America
And we grow up,

tears of our countries,
crying out in pain,
future of the Americas,
troubled lands of hope
we, your country's newest refugees,
the refuse of your teeming shores,

sent back at your borders
sent back in your planes,
we face once again the tragedy we fled
we, the daughters and sons of the Americas,
now yearning to be free

a foot in one place,
a foot in the other,
neither place to call home
we cry out to you
with the pain of yesterday,
we cry out in the night
with the loneliness of our days
here can never be home,
there can be home no longer,
we die from your bullets,
we're victims ofyour guns,
we're turned back at your border,
nowhere to run.

Catsup Plate Records
Rob Carmichael's Swarthmore-based music
production company gives fledgling bands
a shove in the right direction.
By Jessica McFarland
While almost all college-age students have a fairly active interest in
music, few take this interest to the
level that a Swarthmore student, Rob
Carmichael '96, has in recent
months.
Since last January,
Carmichael has been producing
albums for his own small-scale
record label. Catsup Plate Records.
Carmichael's freshman year, he
was sitting in Sharpies with a friend
who found himself somewhat dissatisfied with the food and service provided. Instead carving some
demeaning message into the tray,
they used some extra ketchup they

had left over from their dinners to
write a message to the kitchen crew
on their plates. They kept writing
messages every day for most of their
freshman and sophomore years, and
hence the name of the record label.
Inspired by the recent movement
in offbeat music toward private,
low-budget production, Carmichael
began his label by simply writing to
other small-scale producers in Los
Angeles and England to ask for help.
The first artist with whom
Carmichael worked was another
Swat student, Jacob Anderson '95.
After hearing some of Jacob's
music, Carmichael thought that it
would be a good idea for him to send
some of his tapes to smallproducers
in L.A. and England. Later, however, he realized that it wouldn't be
that much more difficult to simply
produce Jacob's music himself.
Rob's role in themusic world provides the crucial link between the
recordings of small bands and the
public. When he decides to assume
the responsibility of production for a
group, Carmichael obtains a master
copy of the musicians' work, dubs
copies to send to anyone who orders
them and to fanzines for review, and
photocopies the covers designed by
the musicians.
The three dollars that he charges
for the tapes covers his costs but
does not provide him with much of a
profit Carmichael says that, if anything, he's lost money on this venture. Because production is somewhat trying financially, Carmichael
is forced to be selective about what
music he produces and sometimes
has to turn bands down, which is the
part of the production process that he

Since January, Carmichael has
released 6 albums, and he has three
and a half more projects in progress.
One of his releases is a compilation
of the music of several bands from
both the United States and England.
Last weekend, Carmichael organized a concert at Olde Club for
seven of his bands; the concert last
for four hours and was "much more
successful" than he had anticipated.
While Carmichael clearly finds
the music that he produces to be
worthwhile, he concedes that it is
"decidedly not for everyone." There
is no particular sound characteristic
of Catsup Plate's releases; the
albums that Carmichael has produced range in style from pop to
improvisational jazz to what he
describes as "Broadway-ish, country
western ukulele."

someone at the Desk, it will be

point, a potential news story will
inevitably be forced to travel down a
circuitous route.
For one thing, the bureau need to
make sure that "b-roll", or visual
images, are available to accompany
a news story. Without pictures, a
television piece is worthless. No
viewer will be willing to sit in front
of a screen for two minutes watching a corespondent narrate the news
fromher desk. Viewers want action,
constant engagement in a story.
This is why television cameras are a
hot commodity on the news floor.
More importantly, viewers want
to hear informationfrom the mouths
of the newsmakers themselves:
Clinton explaining international foreign policy. Congressman Dole
arguing the health care plan, prosecution and defense attorneys voicing
their positions in a major trial.
Critics of television news are
quick to criticize this type of reporting: so-called "sound-bite" journalism. They argue thatnot all sides of
an issue are presented, that viewers
are not provided with accurate and
impartial presentations of the news.
But when producers are allotted a
mere ":minute,. forty five" to deliver
a story on the Haitian crisis, for
example, sound-bites are their great-

Despite this strange combination
of genres, Carmichael says that the
music he and most other small labels
produce is extremely approachable,
as are the musicians who create it.
Because he sees his production
efforts as a source of enjoyment
rather than profit or recognition,
Carmichael doubts that Catsup Plate

For the time being, it is a belief
in the value of the music he produces

unique new music.

will survive. Follow the latter, and there is no
safety in knowing that it will be around the following day. I observing the actions an thoughts
of major decision-makers in the television business this summer, I was surprised to be impresses by their dedicationto both areas. They always
strived to find a balanced medium—sometimes
they did, sometimes they didn't. But they never
had to wholly sacrifice either their ratings of
their moral ideas.
Arguments of what deserves to be called news
still continue in the newsroom today, but I have
renewed faith that these newsmen and women
have not forgotten their first and foremost
promise as journalists: to keep the public
informed and aware. I can safely tell you that
they are a lot more committed to this ideal than
you probably think. The amount of effort and
thoughtfulness they put into their work is
admirable when one considers the lack of appreciation the public often gives them.

respect that they deserve, at least they will

Interview with a Vampire
Imagine really beautiful people doing really erotic things on screen.
Now imagine, that there's blood everywhere. You've got it; it's

Interview With The Vampire, Neil Jordan's screen version of the monster best seller by Anne Rice (pun intended). Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt,
Kirsten Dunst, and Antonio Banderas are the centerpieces of this beautiful cast.
Beyond the cast, the movie itself is eye-candy. It's very easy to watch
as it drifts through dark set after darker set. Jordan does a superb job of
creating impressive shots that vary from the truly weird to the even more
frighteningly normal. However, some of his more symbolic images are
a bit overbearing (the birds in the cage, and Louis dispensing of the vampires with a scythe).
The actors, though, were a joy to

thing about the movie (since we never
truly see what it's like for Louis as an, "immortal with a mortal soul");
she kills indiscriminantly, as often for joy as survival. Yet she also shows
us that she has some mortal feeling left when she falls in love with
Louis. Tom Cruise, receiving much abuse for assuming the role of
Lestat-creator of Louis and Claudia—is intimidating as a psychological
ogre bent on controlling Claudia and Louis towards his own amusement.
Brad Pitt plays Louis as a quiet, understated creature caught in the strug-

gle between two lives.

It's here the movie starts to fall flat. The heart of the story is Louis and
his struggle to reconcile his vampirehood with his still-mortal soul, but
he cannot get over a feeling of pity for the human race, and refuses to
kill people at first. His struggle is epic. Yet, every time the movie starts
to let us into his mind and see how bitter the pain is for him, it rums
away and leaves us with less than a glimpse into Louis. This is my main
complaint with the film.
The most effective part of the film comes when Christian Slater, playing the man interviewing Louis, asks him to make him a vampire. In
doing so, he forces every person in the audience to fully realize what
they've been thinking about, consciously or unconsciously. For the
whole film: given the chance, would you become a vampire? Then you
sit back, think about Louis' message in the film, and realize you'd never
want that life.
Don't get me wrongeven though the film never really lets you in to
Louis' plight, you'll still walk away feeling emotionally beaten. Karsten
described the film as a "psychic enema." Thanks, Karsten. Go see
Interview. If it were Wilbur, people would say, "this pig is amazing!"

Wrestling

Winter Sports Previews...

As Swarthmore's Wrestling team prepares for the upcoming season, they do so
under the supervision of possibly the finest
coaching staff in their conference. Head
Coach Ron Tirpak possesses an extensive
knowledge of the sport that is a product of
both his impressive career as a wrestler and
his extensive training as a coach. Heplaced
fourth in the 1993 World Championships
and has been awarded the Coach's Silver
Certification, placing him among the top
five percent of United States coaches. Assistant Coach Jay Peichel 'B9 was a Division HI Ail-American and one of
Swarthmore's most outstanding all-time
wrestlers. Conditioning Coach Ron
Artingstallplaced second in the 1993 World
Championships and is known world wide
for his fitness expertise.
This distinguished coaching staff will
have a lot of talented wrestlers to work
with this season. Captains Eric Williams
'95 and Mike Madden '95 are sure to be big
factors in the team's overall success. The
Garnet will also be led by returning wrestlers Jason Sturm '97, Chaz Teplin '96,
ShawnBechett '97, MattMiller '96, Caleb
Olin '96, AlanSama '97 and CurtisTrimble
'96.
Coach Tirpak has been impressed with
his team, saying, 'These guyshave worked
very heard in the preseason, much harder
than any other team I can remember." Hopefully, this hard work will pay off at the 13
team Takedown Tournament being held at
Swarthmore's fieldhouse this Saturday at
11:00 am, and at the Garnet's first official
meet on December 3 at home against
Albright College, Rutgers University, and
Western Maryland University.
As far as the rest of the season is concerned, Coach Tirpak commented, "The
fact that we're a young team doesn't concern me. We're a talented young team. We
expect strong contributions from the freshmen. Our success depends on how well
we're able to fill the lineup." He added
that, "We're mostly concerned with progressing, so that we can be competitive in
the post season tournaments, as we always
are."
Over winter break the wrestling team
will be traveling to Canada to compete in a
number very competitive tournaments.
Coach Tirpak comments, "We plan to use
this opportunity to get some hard training
in...and of course, a little skiing."

As fall sports wind down, a new batch of
athletes prepare themselves for the upcoming winter season. Swarthmore's Squash
team has been practicing in preparation for
their season as a club sport
Although the squash team is not a varsity
sport, they compete like one. The co-ed team
traveled toFranklin Marshall this past Saturday to compete against F & M and George
Washington. Although Swarthmore did not
prevail, the team competed very well. Hunter
Gehlbach '95 and Brandt Lincoln '95 turned
in exceptional performances.
The team is led by Gehlbach '95 and
Lincoln '95 and receives direction from
Coach Mark O'Brien. The team derives
strength from its many returning players as
well as from new additions. Returning members include Cameron Boyd '96,
Michelangelo Celli '95, John Derderian '97,
Seth Harvey '97, Matt Lowry '97, and Paul
Wachter '97.
Because softball squash recently became
an Olympic sport, Swarthmore along with
most teams will play softball exclusively,
abandoning the hardball they formerly used.
The team will face several more matches at
home before Christmas break and then will
hit the season full force upon their return to
campus.
Charity Miller

The Women's varsity Badminton team
has begun theirpre-season practice, and all
the members of the team have high hopes
for the season. With top returning varsity
players Thanh Hoang '97, MeredithCollins
'95, Vanya Tepavcevic '97, and Shilpi
Chandra '97, the team shows a lot of promise in accomplishing a winning season this
year. In addition to the returning players,
the many new recruits among the first year
students are adding depth as well as enthusiasm.
The badminton team will be playing seven
matches and is involved in three tournaments. At this point, the team is scheduled
to play the Academy of the NewChurch on
January 19 for their first game of the season. On February 26, the team will be
hosting the Northeastern Intercollegiate
Tournament, which will be the final match
of the year.
Numerous men practice regularly with
the squad, but they are not officially members of the varsity team. Instead, these
players participate on a club level. Occasionally they travel with the team and play
a few exhibition matches.
Coach Dan Sears predicts that "all the
hard work the team is putting in will pay off
with a successful season."

Another year, another chance to hurt
some more. Welcome to IndoorTrack '95,
as the now infamous head coach, Ted Dixon,
searches for new hills to climb, weights to
lift and zip codes to visit. Indoor Track is
traditionally the most successful winter
sport and this year looks to be no exception
with many strong veteran athletes returning in addition to a wealth of promising
newcomers. Nowhere is this more the case
than in the sprint squad.
For the men, junior Mike Turner and
sophomore Eric Pakurar return to head the
pack ofSwarthmore Sprinters and are looking forward to a successful year, especially
in the 4x200 and 4x400 relay events. Newcomer Tim Sibley '9B, looked impressive
in preseason practice and should also find a
place on one or both of the relay squads.
Sibley, however, ran into trouble when he
tore his miniscus duringWednesday's practice. Also returning after strong seasons
last year are junior captain Sam Paschel,
Chris Hourigan '96,Walid Gellad'97, Dave
Rich '95, Al Molnar '97, and Chris Fowler
'97. Although Nate Barbour's '96 semester abroad hurts the team in the sprint
hurdles, the sprint squad has not had this
much depth in years and shoulddo well in
conference competition this season.
On the women's side, although National
qualifier and Conference Champion Tina
Shepardson '94 graduated last year and
Kim Killeen '97 has decided to take a year
off by joining the Swim team, the Women's
sprint squad looks as formidable as ever
with Kate Dempsey '95 and Megan
Cunningham '95 looking to lead the team
to greater heights this season. Claire Farrel

'97 and Jill Willdonger '97 hope to repeat
their outstanding rookie seasons and will
look to win a place on the 4x400 relay with
Dempsey and Cunningham. The impressive First Year turnout this year doubles the
size of the team, as this young team will be
looking to repeat the upsets of last year.
Team members will continue to joinpractices as fall sports end. Many of the longer
distance runners are involved in Cross
Country which finished competition this
past Saturday.
The team's first meet is the extremely
competitive "All-Comers" meet at
Swarthmore on December 10th.

Swat Swim Team Looks For Strong Conference Season
Swarthmore's Tough Loss to Conference Powerhouse
and Rival Gettysburg College Reveals Team Weaknesses

practices.

beaten badly by the conference powerhouse Gettysburg, there were

The week was not ahuge competitive success for Swarthmore's swimmers, but their spirits are certainly
high as they gear up for an exciting
and promising season. The men's
and women's teams swam against
Gettysburgthis weekand were beaten
badly. Gettysburg swam exceptionally well, as Swarthmore struggled.
Despite the loss, a few individuals
shone: Skye Fulkerson '96 won the
100 breast and Justin Herring '97
swam an incredible 200 fly.
Swarthmore's men'srelay team came
within two seconds of the College
record, and they are certain to break
it by the end of the season. Therefore, although the team was soundly
defeated, there were a few stand-out
performances and the potential for
improvement in many areas will push
the entire team.
Senior captain Matt Cohen has
several predictions for the season,
among them a possible second place
finish in the Conference, behind
Gettysburg. 'He commented on the
loss to Gettysburg, "After being

some low spirits, particularly since
the times were not as fast as we had
hoped. But the talent on this team is
just waiting to show the rest of the
field that smart people can be speedy,
too." He also feels that Swarthmore
traditionally struggles during the
regular season, but that when it is
time for the team to taper and prepare for the Centennial Conference
Championships, they are as good
as, or better, than any school in the
league. Cohen predicts that when
the Conference Championshipsroll
around in February both the men's
and women's relay teams will defeat Gettysburg and the team will
perform very well overall.
Despite the heavy atmosphere
surrounding their most recent loss,
Swarthmore's swimmers have always been a creative and lighthearted group out of the water. Traditionally, the swim team has had
great success with making nicknames for people that both stick and
fit remarkably well. In fact, there
are a few that have stuck so well that

the individuals' real names were
quickly forgotten (at least by the
swimmers). In past years, Eric

Engstrom '96 became "Iggy" for
eternity, Andrew Marino '96 appropriately became "Pablo", and Jamie
Raich '97 assumed the name "Suave"
(pronounced with a strong A). The
team prides themselves on truly capturing the personalities of those
whom they honor with alternate
names, as the names often remain
for years. As a whole, the team now
refers to themselves as the Quicker
Quakers and is fond of the saying,
"Just add water and we go to mush."
Nothing could bring the spirits of
this team down due to their strong
sense of teamwork and friendship.
The regular season lies ahead of
the team as they continue to work
hard and to have a good time. If you
have never seen a swim meet, this is
a good time to head down to Ware
Pool and check it out. After all, you
now know all the nicknames, and
some of the team gossip; why not
see these hard-working men and
women do what they do best, in the
water, that is.

Women's Cross Country
Finishes Sixth in Regionals

Athletes of the Week
Molly MarinO '9B began her
first season on the Swimming team with
two strong meets. Marino dominated in
the team's first meet againstMisercordia
and Rutgers-Camden in the 200IM, as
well as the 500 meter freestyle. Her 500
time was 5:29; anything under 5:30 is
phenomenal. Marino continued this
strength in the team's recent match with
Gettysburg. Although the team lost 48136, Marino had an impressive outing
by swimming 2:04.96 in the 200 meter
freestyle and 2:19.06 in the 200 meter
backstyle.
"Molly is an absolute monster in the
water. She's really fastand works hard,"
said a teammate. Added another, "If she
keeps improving at this rate, she will be
unstoppable at conference."

IfNational berths were given on thebasis on
how many 400s a team ran in training, the
Women's Cross Country team would definitely have nabbed one. Unfortunately, such
glory and fame will have to be postponed one
more year. This past Saturday at Allentown
College, the women's team placed sixth in the
NCAA Division HI regional meet. The top
three teams advanced to nationals. Those
teams included Rowan College ofNew Jersey,
Moravian, and Haverford.
The Swarthmore Harriers had high hopes
going into this meet. They spent their whole
season preparing for it and specifically planned
not to peak at Centennials. They did not taper
at all for Centennials, saving thatfor regionals.
Coach Ted Dixon devised a quirky new tapering workout, "Carolina Cruisin'", that had the
team edgy to run all week. This consisted of
having both the women's and men's teams do
nothing for the final week of workouts but run
around the practice field a few times each day.
Those among us accustomed to track workouts
did not mind the quick repetition, but the true
distance runners were physically aching for
some nice LSD (don't get excited, it just stands
for long slow distance).
The tapering workout resulted in awesome
races for the women. The Swat pack made its
final appearance this year, with Captain Kate
Dempsey '95 leading the way. She placed 29th
with a time of 20:18. Close on her heels was

Graham Lucks 98 recently
finished a powerful first season as a
Cross Country Harrier. Lucks was one
of seven men fromSwarthmore to compete in the Mid-AtlanticRegionals. The
team finished sixth, only 17 points from
a chance to compete in nationals. Lucks
himself was the first Swarthmore finisher, placing 22nd out of 190 runners
overall.
"Graham is a gutsy frosh and the team
clown," said a teammate. "He works
hard and is a fast runner." Another
teammate added, "In this race he had an
excellent time for the course we ran and
especially for a frosh."

Danielle Wall '9B, placing 31st in 20:19. The
times were great for such a hilly course. Next
in the pack came Amy Klosterman '97, who
placed 38th, and Shoshannah Pearlman '9B,
who finished44th. DanielaLearner '96, Alison
Schirmer '97, and Ingrid Spies '96 completed
the pack. Proof of their dedication to peaking
at regionals was in the sound beating that
Gettysburg, Centennial champion, received
by the legs of the Swatties.
The end of the 1994 season inspired several
team members. Debra Junnila '97 said, "We
had a lot offun and we improved a lot, and next
year our strength will create fear in the hearts
of all our adversaries." Schirmer proclaimed,
"It's been a great season."
It was an accomplished season overall. The
women stayed undefeated for the entire first
halfof their season. Everyone improved greatly
overall. The upper class women Stacy Nakell
'96 and Claire Farel '97 were good inspirations for the bumper crop of spirited frosh who
included Rachel Brakke '9B, Sara Howard
'9B, CathlinTully '9B, and Kate Baird '9B.
"I know that the interim between this cross
country season and the next one will be hard
for our fans to endure, but never fear, because
next year the Amazon women are gonna shred
at even greater heights!" said Wall.
Captain Dempsey, in her final cross country
adventure at Swat, added, "Wehad a group of
very positive and dedicated runners which
made the season fun, and I'm looking forward
to seeing them win next year."

Garnet Tide Ends Season With Tough Loss to W&L
By David Lischer
Trailing 14-9 with under five minutes left to
play against Washington and Lee, the

Swarthmore football team drove

to the Generals' five yard line. As starting quarterback Pat
Straub '97 had just been knocked out of the
game with .a broken thumb, backup quarterback and starting safety Frank San tora '96 had
to direct the Garnet attack. Although the drive
eventually faltered, it was some of the best

football the Garnet played all year. The defense created a turnover, and theoffense rallied
behind San tora who had not taken a snap at
quarterback since 1991.
Although it was not the dramatic comefrom-behind win the nine seniors would have
loved as their final game for the Garnet, it was
good football. The Garnetfinished in sth place
in theCentennialConference with a 3-4 conference record, and 3-7 overall.
In addition to an interception, safety Mark
Fink '95 broke the Garnet record for most
kickoff returns and kickoff return yardage in a
career with 54 runbacks totaling 1,000 yards.
Garnet all-time leading rusher Dave Reeser '95
added to his record with an impressive 115
yards on 25 carries and a touchdown. Reeser
rushed for 743 yards this season, scored six
touchdowns, and was named to the secondteam All-Conference.

Coach M iran stressed that next
s
offense will have to be more balanced
in terms of production than this season's
run-based offense. While there won't be
significantly more passing, the production
should increase as both receivers and quarterback are more experienced. The most experienced receiver is Jason Straub '96, with 21
receptions for 310yards and a touchdown, who
switched from wide receiver to tight end this
season. Sam Paschel '96 was the Garnet's
leading receiver with 31 receptions for 541
yards and five touchdowns. Yet no one who

With four able backs led by Reeser and a
veteran offensive line, the Garnet Tide was
third in the Centennial Conference in rushing
offense, averaging 191.1 yards per game and
scoring 12 touchdowns. In addition to Reeser's
big numbers, Nick Milligan '96 rushed for 480
yards and three touchdowns on 108 carries.
Frank Amar '96 and Pat Donaghy '97 each
contributed over 200 yards. Amar led the
Garnet in average yards per carry with 6.3.
Donaghy was the Garnet's third leading receiver with 11 receptions totaling 140 yards.
The Garnet roster consist of only slightly
over 40 players, and consequently, staying
healthy is the key to Garnet success. "Every
week it's a war of attrition; we face teams with
60-80 guys [on theirrosters] in an uphill battle,"
Amar said. This season there was a wrist-cast
club, a separated shoulder club, and at the end
of the season a concussion club. CoachMiran
is the first to admit injuries are a part of the
game. "It's a situation where you're walking a
tightrope hoping the right guys stay healthy,"
he said.
Finally, congratulations to Wiggins, Williams, and Hegedus who were named to the

When all was said and run, Swarthmore was only 17 points from getting

a scant 8 points, but other than that
team, no one has gotten closer than
this year's team. The team has high
hopes for next year, when Scott

take his place among the nation's

Reents, together with Jeremy

who are both away this year, and
Cameron Warner '97, who is recovering from an injury, compounded
with one of the best class of recruits
since the glory days of '67, should
more than offset the loss of expendable senior captains Gene Vann and
