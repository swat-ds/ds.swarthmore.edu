Michael Pietsch has overseen the production of books such as David Sedaris' "When You Are Engulfed in Flames," Jonathan
Safran Foer's "Eating Animals" and Ernest Hemingway's posthumous memoir "The Dangerous Summer."

BY JACQUELINE SMALL
jsmall2@swarthmore.edu

When Michael Pietsch, the executive
vice president and a publisher at Little,
Brown and Company, spoke Tuesday
night in the Scheuer Room, he said that
he hoped his talk would bring talented
people to the field.
"I'm always looking to offset the
impression that the [publishing] business is dying or difficult and convey all
my enthusiasm and optimism. We've
gotten some very good candidates as a
result of these talks," said Pietsch, who
was invited by the English literature
department and Career Services.
In his lecture "e-Books, ißooks, pbooks, Books!", Pietsch discussed his
own career path, his advice for aspiring
editors, the history of book publishing
and his predictions for the future of the
industry.

Unlike many who believe that physical books
now called "p-books" by
publishers to distinguish them from ebooks
will be replaced by technology,
Pietsch expressed excitement about the
new developments.
"The best thing about the digital
world and books is that people buy
books when people they trust recommend them, and the internet has accelerated word of mouth a millionfold," he
said.
He added that because physical books
have a great deal of sentimental value,
and because digitalization does not
improve the reading experience, he
expects that they will continue to coexist with electronic books "for a long
period in the future."
Pietsch said that being an editor is
"the most fun job in the world. It's an
honor and a constant surprise and
you're always learning new things." He
started as an intern and worked his way
up over the course of many years at different publishers. Over the course of his
career he has edited both fiction and
nonfiction, by new authors and by high-

profile
authors including
James
Patterson, Ernest Hemingway and
David Foster Wallace.
One of his most important lessons
was that authors do not necessarily follow the suggestions of editors.
"The writer's voice is the writer's
voice, and your job is not to change it„
to
but to make it as good as you can
help them reach the Platonic ideal of
what that book can be," he said.
"Relationships with authors evolve over
time, but you have to earn their trust.
You have to show that you know what
they're trying to do, and you get what
authority you have by that discern-

publishing and that's what they enjoy,"

she said.
Pietsch warned, however, that it is
not as easy to be employed in editing as
this talk might make it seem. "I didn't
mean to say it was easy to get a job in
publishing
it's not easy to get a job
so there might not be as
anywhere
many openings but if you're open to
casting your net broadly there are more
opportunities," he said. He encouraged
students to look into sales and marketing, as well as editing.
Laura Sibson, assistant director of
Career Services, said in an e-mail after
the lecture, "In our experience, students
resonate with hearing from a person

ChesTech, which started out
as a class project designed to
enable Chester residents to gain
access to technology and basic
computer skills,, has turned into
an ongoing volunteer program in
Chester.
Last semester, nine students
in the Socially Responsible
Computing class joined forces
with computer science professor
Doug Turnbull, the Lang Center
for
Civic
and
Social
Responsibility and the Chester
Housing Authority, which runs
family developments. Together
they created three computer labs
in Chester and an afterschool program for children.

For some of the children, the

The Education Team, lead by
Kwame Osei 'll and Ivana Ng 'l2,
goes to Chester once a week dropin lesson sessions withkids. They
want to keep the ratio of
Swarthmore mentor to child as
small as possible. The last session, led by 12 volunteers
involved with the project, had an

one-on-one format.
The ChesTech information session last week at Swarthmore had
a good turnout, and new volunteers were recruited. "It is mostly
computer science majors or people who take CS (Computer
Science) courses," Ng, a computer
science and education major,
said.
Osei, a leader of the education
team, said that the project helps
computer science students see
how to apply what they learn to
real life and get them involved in
community service.
ChesTech's original goal was
for the after school lessons to
attract kids in middle school and
high school, but, due to the demographics of the turnout, the group
changed their focus to younger
children.
Ng said that the kids were
amazed just by the students' typing speed. "We take these things

Student wellness initiatives target mind and body
BY

ALLISON GANTT

aganttl@swarthmore.edu
Groups of Swarthmore stu-

dents and administrators are
becoming active advocates for
student physical, mental and
social health this semester. A
need for improved student wellness resources has become
apparent at schools all over the
country as students are faced
with the challenge of balancing
academics, social lives and
physical well-being.

Lori Barkin 'l2, a facilitator
of the new Body Image Support
Group, is one student currently
working to provide students
with the resources to improve
their mental health. "As we
enter Swarthmore, we learn
that it's okay and even praiseworthy to be stressed," she
said.
But, she noted, "Hard work
and health do not have to be
mutually exclusive."
Beth Kotarski, director of
student health, said that Worth
Health Center sponsored a
wellness needs assessment
through the National College
Health Assessment program
last fall. The test was administered to interested sophomores,
juniors and seniors.
The NCHA defined and evaluated college student wellness
on several different levels,
including health, relationships,
drugs, sex, nutrition, exercise,

Students provide wellness
solutions
In the year since the survey's administration, several
wellness initiatives have started on campus, addressing not
only stress, but also the other
areas of wellness listed by the
NCHA.
The Swarthmore Wellness
Advisory Team and Speak 2
Swatties represent just two of
the current student-led wellness solutions.
SWAT, originally called the
Health
and
Wellness
Committee, became an officially recognized wellness group
this past spring through former
Assistant Director of Student
Life Kelly Wilcox '97. In
Wilcox's

Humzah Soofi 'lO and Sami ElDalati 'lO, both of whom graduated in December, are overseeing the group as paid interns.

of SWAT She said that it is
important to address these
issues now because wellness
habits formed in college set a
precedent for after-college tendencies.
SWAT has also joined forces
with the Ashtanga Yoga
Program to open weekly classes to the student body at large.
The yoga program meets four
days a week and is taught
entirely by yoga teaching-certi-

fied students.
The club plans to apply for
funding through an executive
committee next year and organize yoga-focused lectures and
charity classes in the future.
In addition to providing students with an exercise option,
the Ashtanga also helps students with the mental aspects
of wellness.
"One thing that's wonderful

about yoga is that each time
you practice, you get a little
better," said Allison Stuewe 'l2,
Ashtanga.

"Research has also shown the
'mindfulness' that yoga encourages can help manage stress,
depression and even aggression."
Speak 2 Swatties, the peer
counseling and mental health
group on campus, has worked
to provide more open student
discussion groups this semester, Jessica Schleider 'l2 said.
Schleider is co-director of
the Speak 2 Swatties program
and also a facilitator for the
new Body Image Support
Group.

"The support group

...

is actually part of an initiative
to start student-run support
groups on campus, and this is
the first that we're putting out
there to see how it works,"
Schleider said.
Barkin said that the program "provides a safe space for
people to share their experiences and struggles about the

perception
of their body
images." The main priority of
the group is to ensure that students know "they are not

alone," Barkin added.
The Body Image Support

Group meets Sunday nights at

Swatties also plans to sponsor
discussion groups on eating
disorders, depression and anxiety within the coming weeks.

said.

Liz Braun's focus on wellness
As current Dean of Students
and former Director of the
Office of Residential Life at
Mount Holyoke College, Liz
Braun, Dean of StudentsDesignate will bring over 10
years of experience with wellness issues.
"It's definitely something
I'm going to be paying attention to," Braun said.

StuCo highlights: budget cuts slow ADA projects

swarthmorephoenix.com

Due to budget cuts, there has
been a hold-up in funding for

already proposed projects to
increase accessibility on campus.
According to Vice President
Deivid Rojas 11, the Board of
Managers has said that bigger
projects must be completed by
2013. StuCo would take the role of
emphasizing the importance of
these issues and obtaining student feedback on the proposed ini-

tiatives.

Benjamin Francis 'l2, student
groups advisor, pointed out the
importance of cost-benefit in analyzing potential projects.
"It's just as an important question for us as what do we want to
prioritize, and I know there's just
not a ton of money to go around,"
he said.

StuCo will continue to deliberate on the best way to utilize current resources to make the campus more accessible for people
with disabilities.

policy representative, and Sonja
Spoo 13, appointments chair, met
with Registrar Martin Warner
last Wednesday to discuss the possibility of developing a course recommendation book providing stu-

dent feedback on Swarthmore professors and courses, which would
be available online for students.

The registrar's office is willing
to provide data for the course
book, but even so, the data would
most likely just be a general list of
courses, Spoo said.
"The administration doesn't

want to take it on because there's
a lot of faculty opposition to the
idea of public evaluations,"
Burson said.

The design and maintenance of
the book would have to be entirely student-driven, Burson said.
StuCo hopes to find someone
who is willing to commit to

designing and maintaining the
book, potentially with monetary

benefits.
Appeals

Last week, the first appeals session regarding Student Budget
Committee funding was held and
appointments for StuCo committees finalized. Rojas questioned
how to approach the matter of
transparency with the results of
these proceedings.
"My question is, where do you
draw the line?" Spoo said. "What
is too much information that
infringes on the students who are

appealing?"
For appeals, members of StuCo
agreed on keeping names separate
from votes. Only a summary of
the proceedings, including a final
vote count, will be provided. For
appointments, StuCo hopes to create a website that will be updated
each term of all committee member appointments.

FROM THE 81-CO NEWS

Bobby Seale dispels myths about the Black Panthers
BY ATTICUS BRIGHAM
BICONEWS.COM, FEB. 23, 2010
The tension built as Bobby Seale, cofounder of the Black Panther Party, sat
on stage in Sharpless, reviewing notes
and preparing to address the auditorium. The room was filled to capacity
with students curious as to what the
lively, suspender and cap-wearing 73year-old would say.
In the next two hours, he recounted a
history of the Black Panther movement
and the very party he had helped to
found: how they had supported the
African American community, defended their rights, and stood up for themselves.
The media has portrayed Seale and
the panthers as violent and militant,
but he quickly dispelled any preconcep-

tions audience members might have of
him.
"If you try to research me through
conventional media channels, you'll get
a
distorted

image," he said.
In the '6os,
then-governor
Ronald Reagan

called him a
hoodlum and a
thug
even
though
he'd
been studying at
Merritt College
by day, working
by night, and
conducting testing as an engineer
at
the

mmmmm^^^^^m

Party.
"By the end of 1969, I had 29 dead
Black Panthers and 12 dead policemen

on my hands. We took no crap from the
racist pig power structure and they
were vicious. What I see nowadays is
lightweight."

He stated that such causalities were
a result of the Black Panther's "direct
policy of responding to violence with
violence"
and
called FBI director, J. Edgar
Hoover "vicious
out
and underhandto
ed."

"You can't drop
of
society. You've got fight
against the Richard
Nixons of the world."
Bobby Seale
Co-founder of Black
Panther Party

Gemini missile program in between.
"I'm pretty pissed off, you know
what I mean? He didn't say Bobby Seale
was a jazz drummer
I'm a jazz drummer. He didn't say Bobby Seale was a
comedian
I'm also a stand-up comedian. He didn't say Bobby Seale was an
expert barbeque cook," he said as the
audience burst out laughing. "But a
hoodlum."
Still, Seale was a mover and a shaker.
Back in college, Seale and his friends
even challenged their anthropology
class. Seale demanded of his professor
why she used the term "Negroid,"
which has derogatory roots.
Other black students were concerned
and upset. One said, "Get all your politics away from it; 'Negro' only means
black. It's a Spanish term, brother,"
Sharp as ever, Seale responded,
"Brother, we ain't from Spain."
Seale's friend Huey Newton
who
would later go on to co-found the Black
Panther Party with him
stood up for
Seale and convinced the professor to
adopt the term "Africanoid."
That wasn't all. Seale said they had
to equalize the terminology too. If there
was "Africanoid" and "Mongoloid,"
white people shouldn't be "Caucasian,"
but "Caucasoid."
It was not until the early '6os that
Seale's political activism ignited. The
murder of JFK
the first president he
voted for
Nelson Mandela's incarceration, and a Martin Luther King speech
from Oakland in 1962 all motivated him
to take action.
Of King, Seale said, "Here was a guy,
he was a preacher, that was supposed to
tell us how to deal with getting rid of

8

institutionalized racism in America."
He spoke to the crowd gathered in
Oakland about the discriminatory hiring practices of bread companies, and
said, "'We're going to boycott 'em so
consistently and so profoundly, we're
gonna make Wonderbread wonder
where the money went.'"
After that, it was the assassination of
Malcolm X that provoked Seale and
Newton to co-found the Black Panther
Party, in order to defend themselves.
Not one to mince words, Seale directly addressed the most tumultuous years
of his leadership of the Black Panther

1968,
In
Hoover described
the
Black
Panther Party as
"the
greatest
threat to the
internal security
of the country."
Seale cited the
surveillance,
infiltration, police harassment, and
eavesdropping Hoover engaged in to
weaken and discredit the party as reasons there are lingering misconceptions about it.
The party's first conflict with police
took place at a rally organized to
protest the draft and the war in
Vietnam. Sealed said how "29 percent of
the soldiers dying in Vietnam were
black, and this country wasn't even recognizing our civil rights. I said we
should not participate in its war."
In Sharpless, the room fell silent as
Seale recited the very poem he had
shared at the rally, against going to war
for "Uncle Sammy."
The crowd went wild, but at that
point, an undercover officer told Seale
he was under arrest. Seale, not recognizing him for a policeman, said, "Get
your hand off of me." Soon, it escalated
into a fight, and Seale pulled out his
scout knife
which the media referred
to as a stiletto switchblade
and cut
him.
He could have been sent to jail for up
to ten years, but he told the judge it was
self-defense, and was given probation.
In the meat of his talk, Seale
described the development of the Black
Panther Party and its conflicts with the
overwhelmingly white FBI and San
Francisco Police Department. He and
other panthers studied California law,
and they used what they learned to
assert their rights.
If an officer ever stopped Newton in
the car and asked him for his phone
number, Newton would roll down his
window just a crack and answer,
"Five."
The policeman would usually ask for

his number again, and Newton would
repeat, "Five! The Fifth Amendment.
You have my identification, license
plate number, and address. That is all I
have to reveal."
One time, a group of panthers lined
up to observe an officer writing out a
ticket
all of them carrying loaded
guns. They expressed their right to
legally bear arms, and when the officer
tried to intimidate them, they responded with the Constitution.
Seale said, "We never stooped to the
level of being racist, hating another
simply based on the color of their skin.
We ran coalition politics
and never
reduced ourselves to separatist, xenophobic Black Nationalism."
Seale called for, "Liberation and
greater economic parity outside what
Wall St. corporate capitalism has done."
To the politically apathetic in the
room, he said, "You can't drop out of
society. You've got to fight against the
Richard Nixons of the world."
He ended by proclaiming, "Power to
the people," before taking questions. He
had books, posters, a documentary, and
even a barbeque cooking show available for purchase.
On the whole, students seemed invigorated by his talk.

"It was important on the basis of not
Bobby Seale, but the Black
Panther Party itself," said Bert Lee 'l2,
co-head of the Black Students' League
(BSL),
which brought Seale to
Haverford.
"The way he said it was more of a
story than a lecture. And I found that
engaging because it had a tangible feel
You could understand the real beginnings of the story as opposed to how the
media portrayed it."
Kahmai Martin-Kirkland 'l2, another co-head of BSL, said that Seale's lecture had "a different pace than the
usual Haverfordian two-hour standard
speech,"
it was less academic and
more accessible than most.
Florencia Foxley 'l3, who had read
about Seale in high school for an independent study on the '6os, enjoyed the
talk.
She said that the Black Panthers had
a reputation for hating whites, but
Seale diffused the misconceptions with
humor.
Seth Kennedy 'l2 said, "Clearly, he
gave his view of everything. I did not
agree
with everything he said.
Nonetheless, I found it interesting."

Benefit concert aims to return music to Haiti
BY NINA PELAEZ
npelaezl@swarthmore.edu
This past Sunday, a benefit concert
was held at Lang Concert Hall to aid in
the relief and reconstruction of Haiti in
response to the recent earthquake that
devastated the island nation. The student
council and the borough's Trinity
Church co-sponsored the event, which
brought Swarthmore students and the
outside community together in support
of Haiti and in appreciation of song.
The program included a diverse selection of musical pieces, ranging from a
suite by J.S. Bach to a Haitian version of
"Our Father" and including group vocal
pieces with and without musical accompaniment, as well as ensemble and solo
instrumentals. Each piece was performed with passion and grace, highlighting both the skill and sensitivity of
each of the performers.
James Smith, the conductor of the
choir of Trinity Church, thanked the
audience for their attendance, contributions, and solidarity. "We feel a tremen-

dous sense of loss for what has happened," Smith said. "It is really hard to
know how to respond in the face of something so staggering."
The concert certainly did a wonderful
job of contributing, in its own way, to the
efforts providing aid to Haiti in this time
of need. The donationsreceived at the
concert are going to support Partners in
Health and provide funds to help replace
musical instruments destroyed in the
earthquake.
Beyond its support of Haiti, the performance also stood as a beautiful compilation of talent and an exquisite arrangement of musical pieces. The performance
opened with "Sarabande" from "Suite in
D minor" by Bach, performed by cellist
Francesca McNeely. The piece was a
powerful opening te the concert, with a
dark and almost melancholy air. As the
concert went on, it incorporated pieces
with an assortment of dispositions

some were somber, while others were
more lighthearted and even playful. The
audience erupted with applause after a
very young but exceptionally talented

violinist, Noah Smith, performed a playful melody, "Russian Fantasy" by Leo
Portnoff.
The choir of Trinity Church brought
together a harmony of voices, including
those of Swarthmore Students Ben Starr
11, Anson Stewart 10, Jamie Birney 10
and Romane Paul 10. The choir performed a number of classical pieces as
well as other, less familiar ones such as
"Papa Nou," a Haitian version of "Our
Father," which was sung in Creole.
Emile Desamours, a noted Haitian composer, composed the piece.
A number of instrumental pieces by
Haitian composer Julio Racine were also
included in the program. "Tangente au
Yanvalou," Smith explained, is a "traditional Haitian folkdance." Smith spoke to
the audience about the style of the
Haitian music. "What's characteristic
about these songs is that the rhythms
are very round, as if they've been filed
off around the edges," he said.
"[James Smith] lived and worked in
Haiti for 12 years
he was devastated
when he heard the news," Birney said.

"As a musician and as college students,
there's not a whole lot we can do, and
this was really exciting as a way to
help," he added.
The concert concluded with a lovely,
hopeful piece played by a string ensemble. The song, "Sous la Tonnelle," was
composed by Ludovic Lamothe and
seemed to look forward toward a promising recovery for Haiti. The performance
was wellreceived by Swarthmore students. "I found the concert very moving,
especially the strings," Natalia CoteMunoz 'l2 said.
The concert is one of many events
organized in collaboration with
Swarthmore College to benefit those
affected by the recent disaster. Events
have included a Haitian Earthquake
Collection, Call to Action and the Faculty
Dance Concert that honored Haiti, as
well as the upcoming Haiti Charity Ball.
The diversity of these events speaks to
the strong response of the community in
providing relief in the midst of this crisis, as well as to the interdisciplinary
nature of these efforts.

Swarthmore Movie Committee's
film-of-choice
weekend,
last
"Precious," moved the audience members with anger, depression, joy and
triumph in a powerful way. It was a
much-needed reminder not to take life
for granted.
Based on the novel "Push" by
American
Sapphire,
writer
"Precious" portrays the life of
Clareece Precious Jones (newcomer
Gabourey Sidibe), an illiterate, obese
and black 16-year-old living in
Harlem, New York in the 1980's, who
goes by the name Precious. As if circumstances aren't difficult enough,
Precious has an abusive mother

(Mo'Nique), an incestuous father, a
baby named Mongo with Down
Syndrome who is cared for by
Precious's grandmother and another
baby on the way, for which she has
been kicked out of school. Every day,
Precious imagines an alternate world

to stop taking life for granted. The
reality of Precious's life is frightening. Because people don't constantly

see and remind themselves of circumstances worse than theirs, it becomes
easy to take life for granted.
Natalia Cote-Munoz 'l2 described
the movie as "difficult to digest, but in
a good way." The movie's strong material and story make it hard to get
through because people don't want
the story to be true. However, the
reality ofPrecious's situation is a crucial distinction that everyone needs
to understand.
"What struck me was how we
would go back to Precious's dreams
and subconscious: there was a huge
contrast between the Hollywood personality and the haunting images of
her reality; the ghost of her rape and
the boiling, fried food," Cote-Munoz
said. "It made it easier for you to get
into Precious's shoes and actually get

a feel of her situation."

Benshi tradition unites
the audience with films
BY ISAAC HAN
ihanl@swarthmore.edu
It is in the theater where communication between the filmmaker and the audience is able to begin, a fact that was
demonstrated in the recent Benshi
Symposium and film screening.
The two-part Cooper series event held
on Feb. 15 and 16 examined the Benshi
performer. Unlike a narrator in a film, a
benshi performs live at a podium. A benshi is a performer, predominantly associated with the Japanese silentfilm era,
which brings life to a film through narration and dialogue. It is in the Benshi tra-

dition where film meets live theater,
allowing for a unique experience.
"The benshi is making a bridge from
the film to the venue and the audience,"
Japanese professor William Gardner, the
main organizer of the Cooper series event,
said.

.

The symposium, featuring film professors from across the country, focused on
the benshi performance culture, occurred
on Feb. 15. Hikari Hori, a professor of East
Asian langauges and cultures from
Columbia University, gave a talk entitled
"Diasporic spectatorship: migrating cinema, benshi, and Japanese immigrants,"
which elaborated on the presence and
prominence of benshi in cinemas in
Japanese communities across the globe.
The benshi were often the attraction and
people would go for the live benshi performance more so than the actual film.
David Desser, a Professor Emeritus of
cinema studies from the University of
Illinois, explored the role of the benshi
performance and Japan's rich performing

arts culture on film aesthetic, particularly

in the films of Akira Kurosawa. He

narration took a special form
in Kurosawa's films as a result of these
various traditions in Japanese culture.
For instance in "Rashomon" (1950), the
testimonies of each character were presented in a style likened to rakugo theater, in which a person would sit facing
the crowd and tell a long story.
On Feb. 16, Sakamoto Raiko, one of the
few practicing benshi in the world, performed at LPAC cinema with the films
"Blood Splattered at Takadanobaba"
(Okochi Denjiro, 1928), "The Adventurer"
(Charlie Chaplin, 1917), and "Orochi"
(Bando Tsumasaburo, 1925). In a skillful
performance, he guided viewers through
these three silent films, narrating the
action, presenting actors and characters
and providing dialogue to silent films.
"It takes on a whole new life of its own
where it's distinct from any other performance you'll see," Alex Ho 10 said.
"It's like a theater production, in a way,
but it's still film." The narration of the
argued that

Chaplin

r

film added new dimensions of

humor through the dialogue and personalities created by Raiko. The narration of

"Orochi" helped viewers not only to follow the story, but also to understand the
psyche of the main character Heisaburo
Kuritomi (Tsumasaburo Bando), who was
continuously misconceived as a bandit
despite his pure intentions.
The experience was spectacular and
entertaining. Besides narration and dialogue, Raiko-san told jokes and provided
background for the films. His performance bridged the gap between the audience and the filmmaker, highlighting the
important elements of story in each film.
"I really got the sense of energy, the kind
of mania of it all. It was really enjoyable,"
Randy Coll 10 said.

Chick flick showdown takes off on Valentine's Day
BY DINA ZINGARO

Hoping to avoid the piles of readings
growing on my desk and to evade my personal dormant festivities on Valentine's
Day, I ventured out of the Swat bubble to
discover the ultimate romantic Him of the
season. The selected contestants were
"Dear John," based on a novel by
Nicholas Sparks, and the star-laden
romantic comedy "Valentine's Day."
Without-a doubt, both movies had their
good features and great "aww" moments.
Dear John: 3 out of 5 ratings
"Dear John," a film detailing the relationship between a rich girl and a U.S.
army soldier, adheres to the classic

Forces soldier, meets and instantly falls
head-over-heels in love with a college student, Savannah Curtis, in the spring of
2001 during his two-week leave period. It
is hard to deny the endearing nature of
the couple and their ensuing romance, set
along the beautiful coastline of South
Carolina.
Characteristic of Sparks's work, the
two lovers are forced to endure life's
struggles and curveballs. John's unstable
and deteriorating relationship with his

a source of constant struggle for him personally. After the attacks of 9/11, John

Channing Tatum
Seyfried, playing John and Savannah,
project evident chemistry on the screen.
The audience finds itself rooting for the

two characters; the likeability of the pair
salvages the film from many of its disappointing features. Tatum brings his boyish charm to the screen; apparent in both
his shirtless surf scenes and in his displays of tearful emotion. His performance
as the silent and mysterious boy with a
dark past, but a good heart, is compelling.
Seyfried, another young promising actor,

embraces the role of Savannah and complements Tatum's character well with her
natural sweetness and good-girl appeal.
The progression of the story often felt
rushed, especially at the beginning and
end of the film. The director, Lasse
Hallstrom, wasted no time in speeding
through.the first interactions between the
couple. The initial stages of the relation-

ship were unquestionably heartwarming,

but nevertheless remained underdeveloped. Unfortunately, this same hurried
quality also seeped into the final scenes of
the film. Deviating from the novel's conclusion, the movie's ending was vague,

and the final moments failed to leave a
lasting impression

with some less cliched than others.
Various couples in the movie, including
characters played by Topher Grace, Anne
Hathaway and Bradley Cooper, refreshingly depart from the typical cookie-cutter, chick-flick pairings. Kutcher, heartthrob and personal favorite, fulfilled the
role of an optimistic and romantically
naive florist.
As an ensemble movie, the film clearly
allocates more weight to some actors than
others and in most cases, the wrong

Unfortunately, the performance of

Unlike the young stars of "Dear John,"

Swat Style Snapshot
Name: Eric Song
Title: Assistant Professor, English Literature
From: Southern California
Current Residence: Philadelphia, PA
What He's Wearing:
Though his jacket is fairly covered by his coat from
Hickey, Song bought it from Thick as Thieves, a suit tailoring and menswear company based in Los Angeles.

"[lt's] from a weird, relatively cheap, made-to-measure

suit outfit online," he said. Both his dress shirt and
pants are from Uniqlo. "On an assistant professor's
budget," Song said, "Uniqlo is the best thing there is."
He purchased his brown boots on eßay and called his tie
a "cheap-o tie."
While students here possess a knack for dressing well
with added eclectic accents, many professors also display keen sense of fashion. Song came highly recommended from students as having impeccable style. Not
completely professional or overly casual, Song hits the
balance between these two extremes in this outfit. It's a
relatively simple outfit: pants, dress shirt, jacket and tie
in mainly neutral colors. But there's a fusion of a typical, older male professor (minus the elbow patches) and
a young, fashion forward dresser in this look. Song also
looks like someone who could be featured on The
Sartorialist blog; the texture of the gray coat, leather
gloves, worn-in boots and corduroy pants make for a
visually appealing outfit.

How He Describes His Style:

Song considers himself to be in a transition phase in
terms ofhis style. "I'm old enough now that I want to
have a long view of my personal style," he said, "so my
Ultimate end goal is to be a very dapper old man." In
what he calls a "long trajectory," Song continues to
evolve the types of clothing he wears. "I think I'm in a
transition from like looking kind of zany and wearing
slightly bizarre outfits," Song said, "and trying to edit
myself more and more until I reach that goal of being a
dapper old man."
Fashion Influences or Inspirations:
Song occasionally peruses the pages of The
Sartorialist, but credits his father's involvement with
fashion as a possible influence. "My dad's been in the
garment industry for a long time, but, like, cheap

women's clothing," he said, men-

tioning how most of the garment
industry in Los Angeles is run by

Koreans. "I don't know if that's had
some sort of subterranean influence
on me or not," Song said.
Where He Shops:
While Song finds it difficult to find
good places to shop in Philadelphia, he
loves buying clothing from basics
chain store Uniqlo in New York. "I buy
a lot of stuff online, which does and
doesn't work," he said. "I've tried to buy
stuff on Gilt Groupe." Gilt Groupe is an
online sample sale website and also
includes Gilt Fuse and Gilt Man, offering
designer clothing at

discounted prices.

Favorite Item in His Closet:
"I have a vexed relationship with these
raw jeans that I bought," Song said. Raw or
dry denim is not washed after being dyed,
unlike most jeans on the market. Not washing after dying allows for a natural fading
effect and worn-in look. While there's then
no need to buy those already ripped or faded
jeans, many wearers of raw denim don't
wash their jeans for months. "I don't think I
believe in raw denim and how you're not supposed to wash them for months," he said. "It
seems kind of disgusting."
Dressing for Work: Go Casual or
Professional?
Like it or not, professors, there is a stereotype that most teachers at all schools tend to
look like they dressed in the dark. There's the
possibility of going too casual and wacky, or t(
stiff and overly professional. Song feels there i
more opportunity for professors to dress however
they want, though. "I can dress up a little bit, but
usually I don't need to dress like a banker.... It's not
preferable anyways," he said. "You can kind of dress up
but in quirky ways, which is fun." He also enjoys dress

"profissor-esque," but tries to add cool accents to
make it a unique outfit.

New support groups seek to vocalize silenced fears
BY MAKI SOMOSOT
msomosol@swarthmore.edu
Swarthmore is a hotbed of opinionated and passionate
individuals, but the prevalence of their causes
including,
but not limited to, social activism, environmental justice
and gender equality rights
may have left out the silenced,
private struggles that still need to be acknowledged by the
student body. The Body Image and Depression/Anxiety
Support Groups will focus on addressing issues of overall
psychological
well-being and
functioning
among

Swarthmore students.
These confidential support groups will help students confront their personal problems with depression, anxiety,
stress and body image, which includes eating disorders such
as anorexia and bulimia. They aim to fill a still-existing gap
within Swarthmore's support system.
"There is no larger conversation among students on campus, no confidential place," Jessica Schleider 'l2, co-facilitator of the Body Image support group and co-director Of Speak
2 Swatties, said. "A lot of controversial issues are talked
about here at Swarthmore, but not mental health issues."
Schleider added that such issues are often "skirted around"

by students.

"The discussion groups will be a great opportunity for
people to start talking about the stigmatized pressing issues

that affect many people on this campus," Melissa Cruz, who
serves as co-director of Speak 2 Swatties along with
Schleider, said. "It can become a safe support network for
students who need it."
The support groups are a specialized initiative of Speak 2
Swatties. They are borne out of a need to survive in highpressure, stressful academic environments. According to
Schleider, this is not particularly conducive to the "expression of mental health issues." She discussed the implicit
expectation that Swarthmore students always need to be "on
top of everything," and how this mindset could potentially
contribute to the aggravation of psychological health.

Support group co-facilitator Lori Barkin 'l2 expressed
the same sentiment about the work-intensive culture.
"There is a constant sense of guilt looming over everyone
for not being productive and successful enough," Barkin
said. "Even guilt for missing class if you're sick, or feeling
bad for .going to bed early if you haven't done your homework."
Like Schleider, Barkin alluded to the presence of "troubling attitudes of self-perfection" that Swarthmore students
harbor towards themselves, inevitably leading them to "sacrifice health and happiness."
Director of Counseling and Psychological Services
David Ramirez, who served as official point person and
adviser to Barkin and Schleider for the initiative, suggested
that modulation is key for students who want to maximize
their Swarthmore career in a healthy manner. "Swatties
throw themselves into whatever they're doing," Ramirez
said, advocating balance between "intellectual needs" and
"ordinary life needs."
The support groups will address issues such as body
image, depression, anxiety and stress management.
Schleider noted that people often take these issues for granted and fail to "register how common they are." According to
Barkin, body image issues, for instance, are considered the
"most obvious problem in American society, but also the
least spoken about."
"The beauty standard is an uncomfortable standard so
people skip over it," Barkin said. "Most of us internalize it."
Through discussion, the Body Image support groups will
attempt to deconstruct the beauty standard three-fold:
assessing the impact of Swarthmore culture on body image,
evaluating body image in popular media and ultimately
reclaiming a healthy relationship with food.
The groups will not follow a rigid thematic structure, and
will not remain exclusive to exploring only these specific
issues. For now, Schleider and Barkin plan to "play them by
ear" and allow the support group participants to share any
nature or form of personal experience.
Before the initiative began, interest in holding discussion groups had already been sparked in the student body.
Schleider describes that she had received "overwhelming
feedback and responses" from students after she posted
announcements in the Reserved Students Digest. This
proved to be instrumental in the overall process for officially starting up the groups.
"We're just here to serve the college where we see a
need," Cruz added. "We've known that there has been a need
for quite some time."
Instead of one-on-one professional therapy, the groups
will follow a peer support model where participants rely on
...

12

each other as "lifelines." This involves the open sharing of
mutual experience, concrete advice and empathy.
"People often feel isolated in what they're going
through," Schleider said. "The groups will provide a confidential, safe space to talk ab6ut issues."
Students are promised absolute confidentiality of their
participation in the groups. Besides this one logistical similarity, the structure and
intent of both groups
diverge
fundamentally
from CAPS, Swarthmore's
home counseling and psychological services.
"[The support groups]
are completely student-led
and
student-owned,"
Ramirez said. "They would
be a more attractive option
to students, and the
absence of us professionals
might promote that."
Despite thematic distinctions, both groups will equally
emphasize building emotional solidarity between the participants through the open communication of their personal
issues. Ramirez noted that the advantage of support groups
over therapy is that participants will be "getting a reaction

from people who have experienced the same things."
Students stand to gain a host of positive emotional benefits from the peer support model. "People have a lot to offer
people
affection, encouragement, sympathy and common
sense," Ramirez added. "There is less of a focus on these in
therapy. And we're not peers."
In response to how the groups will complement students
who are already in CAPS,
mm^^^^^^

"We're just here to serve the college
where we see a need. We've
known that there has been a need
for quite some time."
Melissa Cruz 'lO

Ramirez suggested they
would "serve as an adjunct
to therapy" and "reinforce

the network of support
services around campus."

rthmore's current production of "Bye
Bye Birdie," is tap dancing away the number with youngsters Annie Byers and
Lyndie Moe with a grin that is more Big Bad

predatory tone is certainly not the director's
intent, but the combination of Ashley
Richardson's forceful choreography and
McCormick's extraordinary height made
more evident by the fact that he is dancing
with two young high school girls, leaves a
bad taste in your mouth.
"Bye Bye Birdie" is the story of a music
producer (Albert Peterson) who is deep in
debt, about to lose his star client to the draft.
His secretary and love interest concocts a
publicity scheme to turn Conrad Birdie's
next single into an instant hit and to bring
the production company back into the black
that sends the trio (Albert, his secretary
Rose and Birdie) to Sweet Apple, Ohio. To
accompany the release of Birdie's single,
"One Last Kiss," Birdie will bestow a kiss
on one lucky fan the day before he ships out
to war, which will be broadcast on "The Ed
Sullivan Show." Written in 1960 and set in
1958, with songs about teenagers going
steady and sipping Cokes with your one
true love, a modern production of "Bye Bye
Birdie" ought to feel sweet and nostalgic.

is underwhelming and occasionally vulgar.
This production of "Bye Bye Birdie" has
more than its fair share of young talent, but
it is the unsettling moments like the one
woman-seven man orgy at the Shriner's
meeting
a graphic and extreme interpre,

tation of the "Shriner's Ballet"
that one
remembers. The word "orgy," which shows
up unnervingly often, is an understatement

and not just in reference to the "Shriner's
Ballet." In the song "Ice House Livin',"
Filippone's teen chorus of 16 middle-schoolers and young high schoolers maul Birdie
and squeal "Let's have an orgy." A line
which should demonstrate how innocent
and confused the kids of Sweet Apple are is

turned into a parent's worst nightmare,
even though the clothes stay on. When the
parents discover this debauchery and send
Birdie to jail for consorting with the underage, it seems like Birdie wouldbe well within his rights to press charges against some
of the older children for displaying raw sexual aggression.
The fact that this scene was so disturbing can be credited to Filippone's flawed
vision and her pool of very talented teenage
actors. A particular standout is Sara

Prendergast in the role of fan club president
Ursula Merkel; her wild devotion is nothing
short of brilliant. Prendergast has a career
ahead of her if she chooses to pursue acting.
Darby Biasotto, as Kim MacAfee, the girl
selected to receive Birdie's kiss, also does a
bang-up job, in part due to her high soprano
and good ear.
Among the adults, Andrea Kalan gives a
fine performance as Rose Alvarez, but lacks
flair. Her voice is just right, and her attitude
is faithful to the script, but she fails to form
a deep connection with the audience.
Perhaps it is her devotion to McCormick's
boring Albert which hinders audience sympathy, but whatever it is, no amount of playful choreography could inspire the sympathy necessary to make the time pass quickly. Length was an issue for the production, i
which dragged along at a snail's pace whenever Albert was on stage and was only
briefly boosted by the occasional presence

of Birdie and a hilarious cameo by the cho-

reographer (Ashley Richardson) in the role
of Gloria Rasputin.
Filippone would have done better to
devote her energy to making the illusion of
1958 complete instead of trying to force a
modern connection. If you've never seen
"Bye Bye Birdie," this is an acceptable
introduction, but only if one regularly
reminds oneself that this is local theater.
Although it is unusual to encourage an
audience to see a film production of a play
or musical instead of seeing it live, this case
is an exception. McCabe Library has a copy
of the Dick Van Dyke/Ann Margret/Janet
Leigh film on DVD, complete with an Ed
Sullivan cameo, that is far less unsettling
not to mention free.

Valentine's

of Liz Lemon is "a sham created by card

companies to reinforce and exploit gender
stereotypes"
but I am a fan of the time-

honored Special Holiday Episode, and not
only because this particular episode of 30
Rock ended with one of the single funniest
scenes ever committed to film. I'm talking,
of course, about the sight of Jon Hamm,
Jason Sudeikis and Dean Winters (three of
Liz's exes, if you were wondering) acting
like Jamaican dental hygienists. It's only
30 seconds long, but it's brilliant.
Anyway, this episode got me thinking
about my favorite holiday TV episodes,
the ones that have made me laugh and the
ones that have really stuck with me. So,
because I'm really busy this week and
because lists are remarkably easy, I present to you, in no particular order, my
favorite Special Holiday Episodes.
Arrested Development: Look, I love
Season Two's Christmas episode,
"Afternoon Delight," as much as anyone,
but "In God We Trust" holds a special

place in my heart. The setup is brilliant:
George Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor) is released
from prison for the day in order to take
part in the Living Classics Pageant, which
is a pageant where wealthy people reenact famous works of art. This is not only
the first episode to prominently feature
humorless attorney Wayne "I shall duck
behind that garbage car" Jarvis (John
Michael Higgins); it is also the episode
where we find out that Tobias Funke
(David Cross) is a never-nude (it's exactly
what it sounds like). Plus, it contains a
line that appeals to my atheism: After

Bart: Don't you mean Shining?

George, Sr.

in Michelangelo's "The Creation of
Adam," a bewildered woman in the pageant audience cries, "Where is God? There
is no God!" Ummm
Merry Christmas?
The Simpsons: The list of great
"Treehouse of Horror" episodes is
extremely long, but I've always been particularly fond of this one, largely because
of an exchange between Bart and Janitor
Willy that takes place during a spoof of
The Shining":

I always love it when The Simpsons
goes meta, and this is as meta as it gets.
Plus, there's a great gag when, during the
second section, Homer travels back in
time and changes things, thus leading to a
future in which Ned Flanders has taken
over the world, Big Brother-style. Come
on, you knew it would happen eventually,
didn't you?
Scrubs: My choice of "My Own
Personal Jesus" may surprise you, especially given my mention of my own lack of
religion earlier in this column. But this
episode, using Turk's (Donald Faison) crisis of faith as a jumping-off point, deals
with a fundamental question: Why do bad
things happen to good people? Turk's
faith, however, is ultimately restored
and the cynicism of his friends abated, for
a moment after he witnesses what some
would call a Christmas miracle. Lest this
all sound too sentimental for you, there's
also a highly entertaining subplot in
which J.D. (Zach Braff) is asked to videotape the birth of Dr. Cox's (John C.
McGinley) friends' baby and is later forced
to make up a condition called prenatal
lice. Also, this episode features John
Cale's killer rendition of Leonard Cohen's
"Hallelujah," one of my favorite songs.
Gossip Girl: Gossip Girl's quality has
plummeted over the last season, but the
show's first Christmas episode, "Roman
Holiday," was a standout for the juicy,
catty first-season drama. It not only features an important moment in Dan (Penn
Badgley) and Serena's (Blake Lively) budding relationship, back when they used to
be interesting and not the blandest of the
bland, but is also home to an over-the-top
Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) scheme,
and man, do I love a good Blair scheme!
The ending also manages to strike a
perfect balance between sweet and snarky;
Dan and Serena get their perfect
Christmas Eve, but Blair, who had finally
managed to reconcile with her father's gay
lover, also received a somewhat threatening text message from Chuck (Ed
Westwick), former hook-up and best friend
to her boyfriend, Nate (Chace Crawford).
Welcome to Gossip-land, where no holiday
is complete without copious drama to go
with it.
The Big Bang Theory: One of my
favorite episodes of any show ever, and
always a great pick-me-up when I need
one. "The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis" has

an entertaining subplot involving Penny
(Kaley Cuoco) falling for a hotshot physicist (guest star Michael Trucco), much to

chagrin of love-struck Leonard
(Johnny Galecki). But the true star of the
episode is Sheldon (Jim Parson) and his
priceless reaction when Penny gets him a
napkin signed by Leonard Nimoy for

the

Christmas. It's the first time you see
Sheldon willingly make physical contact
with another human being, and it's funny
and heartwarming at the same time. Just
the way a Special Holiday Episode should

be.

Campus must evaluate

As The Phoenix reported last week,

evaluating whether Hallowell should
be a smoking dorm has become a high
priority for the Housing Committee
and the dean's office. Currently,

that houses first-year students. To prevent first-years who do not want to

Swarthmore's smoking policy seems

should not be neglected in reconsidering our current policy.

Readers of The Phoenix may be
unaware of some facets of the college's

entrances to public buildings in order
to prevent creating a "second-hand

must walk. In addition, smoking is
prohibited in all indoor public spaces.

Despite its exceptional

wealth, Swarthmore is
constrained in its endow-

major ways. First, the

college is committed to
"intergenerational equity," meaning providing

equal resources to cur-

rent and future

genera-

tions of students by maintaining the purchasing
power of the endowment,
bearing in mind the likelihood ofincreased future
costs. Put simply, if the
college spent the whole of
the endowment, or even
the whole income from
the endowment, on any
one cohort of students, it
would deprive future
cohorts.
Treasurer
Suzanne Welsh estimated
in April that if the college
began spending 7.0 percent of the endowment
this year, with annual
growth in the future, the
endowment would be
completely exhausted in
just 22 years. This
reflects the second constraint:
Under
Pennsylvania law, seven
percent is the maximum
allowed spending rate
per year.

Given
those
constraints, the various bodies that determine the
college's budget (to be
described in
greater
length in a later column)
work to achieve a level of
spending that allows the
amount spent to increase
with costs and yet is sustainable in the long term.
To do so, the college calculates how much the
endowment is expected to
return each year (endowment income) and how
much it expects costs to
rise in the future. For the
former, the college looks
to the weighted historical
average return to set
long-term expectations.
For the latter, the college
combines expected average inflation (about 3 percent) with expected rises
in costs above inflation

Sportslllustrated.com. (One
might even say that I'm a

bit of a sports fanatic.)
Yet I can't see myself watching more than an hour of
this year's Winter Olympics even though the events are
spread out over two weeks and occur only once every four
years (total time spent watching the Olympics thus far:
half-hour). And I doubt that I've read more than three articles or columns dealing with these Games.
Is the lack of excitement for the Olympics caused by a
spectator problem or by a problem inherent to the event
itself? The most obvious answer is that both parties are to
blame. But I'm not here to talk about why one should or
shouldn'tbe excited at the prospect of watching cross-country skiing or curling
what your preferences are is your
own business. I'm here to talk about why, in my mind, the
current setup of the Olympic Games is flawed because it
focuses on all the wrong things that make a sports event
great and exciting to watch.
Before I start criticizing the Olympics, I want to get this
out of the way. Curling and cross-country skiing aside, I
think that most of the winter events for the Games are
incredibly engaging. Snowboarders invent new tricks each
year that push physical boundaries. I've been enjoying figure skating since performing any quadruple-jump was considered God-like (now skaters are throwing toe loops down
like it's nobody's business). I love that the biathlon is
ridiculous and somehow works combining two totally
well, Canada loves hockey.
unrelated events. Hockey
And the luge was my favorite event until I discovered the
skeleton this year (apparently there are more dangerous
and unreasonable events to participate in).
...

But that's exactly part of the problem with the
Olympics. There are too many events crammed into one 16day period that only comes once every four years. There's
nothing organized about the Winter Games other than the
a
fact that each activity deals with either snow or ice
characterization that could've just as easily described
Swarthmore a few weeks ago. This prompts difficult questions for fans. Which events should I focus on if I don't
have a lot of time? What are the rules for all of these events?
How can I keep track of all of the famous athletes in the
Olympics if they all participate in different events?
Now if you're only interested in one event, then of
course you might not face these problems. But most casual
sports fans don't necessarily have a specific event they are
they want to watch the competiinterested in watching
tions that are the most exciting or the most noteworthy.
Part of the excitement of an event like the FIFA World Cup
comes from its simplicity. It offers the viewer one sport that
has one set of rules; even if you're not a huge soccer fan,
you can. easily get into the matches. If you don't time to
watch all the matches, you can just watch the Finals. You
are exposed to the soccer players year round, every year
not once every four years and for less than a month.
Because there is so little organization between the
events of the Olympics, spectators are forced to look at the
Games through a different set t)f lenses compared to those
that one might use to view the World Cup. I watch the
World Cup to see the best soccer players represent their
countries in an attempt to claim the title of the best national team in the world. Yet because there are so many different athletes participating in a whole range of events in the
Olympics, the purpose of watching the Games to discover
the best athletes in each event becomes diluted. The focus,
instead, turns onto which country wins the most medals
an emphasis that I feel is highly evident in media coverage
of the Olympics.
It may seem naive for me to hope that the Olympics will
become an amazing, worldwide, uniting sports event and
that the greatest athletes from around the world could
come together and vie against one another for the next
claims of greatness. But this dream is ruined by the very
fact that each time I turn on the TV to watch the Games, my
screen is graced with charts with the number of medals
that each country has won. The excitement of watching the
Olympics is no longer derived from seeing the talented athletes from other nations, who gain little exposure internationally, compete and demonstrate their excellence. The
-

excitement comes rather from the tally that is added to
each country's medal count with each victory in an event.
Individuals from a nation feel like they are somehow more
superior to individuals from other countries because of
that number.
We saw these sentiments emerge in the 1980 Winter
Olympic Games at Lake Placid, when the U.S. national
hockey team defeated the Soviet national hockey team in a
medal-round hockey game. It was a huge upset and was
also a huge morale boost for the American public. Many
undoubtedly saw the victory over the U.S.S.R. as a victory
for the U.S. way of life as well, as the two nations were in
the midst of the struggle of the Cold War. I'm not trying at
all to diminish the accomplishment of the U.S. national
hockey team in those Games the win ranks as one of the
biggest sports events I wish I had been alive to experience,
with the movie "Miracle" acting as my favorite sports
movie ever. But the goal of proving one's own nation as
superior to another's hardly seems a worthy purpose in the
Olympics.
Perhaps a more recent example of the focus on winning
medals as opposed to experiencing the brilliance of international athletes in their respective events was represented at this winter's Olympic Games, displayed by Canada's
own program: Own the Podium 2010. The Canadian government launched the OTP program launched in 2005,
establishing a national goal to become the top-medaling
nation at the Vancouver Games. It just seems absurd to me
that it should be established as a national goal that all the
Country's athletes should train their hardest in order to
medal at the Olympics as if that goal weren't intrinsic to
each athlete already. It also highlights a fact that corrupts
instead of celebratwhat the Olympics could represent
ing the accomplishments of athletes as they gather from
around the world to compete in an eventthey share a mutual passion for, the Olympics underscores their differences
and their aims to subjugate the opposition.
But many of the flaws that I point out about the
Olympics Games make them unique compared to other
sports events. It wouldn't be easy to provide a suggestion
on how to make the Games seem more organized, with less
of a focus on being the highest medaling country, without
changing something inherent with the establishment of the
event itself. So I guess to fix the Olympics, one just needs to
well, not the Olympics anymore.

At some point, seasons, careers and
franchises all get reduced to these single

THE PHOENIX

moments in time when things appear for a

fleeting instant as if they will reverse
until
everything we had come to expect
it falls in place with all the rest and
becomes a microcosm. The piece that
explains the entire puzzle.
Football creates these kinds of expectations off the field as well, and that's where
Myron Rolle comes in. For the uninitiated,
the story of Myron Rolle has been one of
the best in sports for going on a year now.

Considered one of the top safeties in college football with first- or second-round
NFL draft potential, Rolle stunned everyone, including his own teammates, when
he announced that he would not be playing
for Florida State in 2009 because he would
instead be attending Oxford University
(the one in England) to study medical
anthropology. Something called the
Rhodes Scholarship had offered to pay for
his time there, and Rolle planned to take
them up on their generosity.
So that's where he is right now, at
Oxford studying to get his medical degree
but with the intention of being drafted into
the NFL come April. On one particular
point, there is virtually no debate: From a
public relations standpoint (and one that
temporarily disregards talent), there may
never have existed a more desirable
draftee than Myron Rolle. He was intelligent, outgoing, funny, courteous, thoughtful, articulate and he had a clean record
and enough motivation to abandon the
comfort zone created by being a star col-

lege athlete and fly halfway across the

world where those kinds of achievements
mean nothing. He would attract attention
(and endorsement dollars) from places the
NFL has never heard of. Parents will go
blue in the face repeating to their kids the
moral of his story
that if you have the
choice, you should want more from life
than athletics can provide you. The 23
year-old man whom Bobby Bowden used
to say was the glue that held his defense
together is the same one Cornel West has
labeled "the future of black America." Two
big pictures that, in the end, boil down to
the singular example of Myron Rolle.
But there is another big picture, a
whole other entity, which Rolle is in danger of symbolizing, and that's the problem
of character in the NFL. Regardless of
whom or how much he impresses between
now and the draft, there are those in the
league who fear taking a player who isn't
entirely dependent on football, who could
walk,away at any moment and find success somewhere else. They question the
focus and drive of a player who left everything he knew behind to finish his studies
at one of the most competitive schools in
the world. Unlike those recovering from
injuries, any rust he might show in trying
to make up the year he has taken off from
football could be seen as a tacit hesitation
to commit fully to a team, and therein lies
the possibility that the game's best role
model might never get a chance to play the
game again.

February 25, 2010

The history of drafting talentedfootball
players with troubled pasts is a long one.
The opposite? Not so much. For someone

like Rolle, who has proven he has the ability to play at a professional level, the idea
that his character could be a detriment to
his career is hard to reconcile with the
legacies of players like Pacman Jones,
Najeh Davenport and Charles Rogers.
Players who have, in recent years, been
given everything by the NFL and have
given back nothing in return. Through
them and others, issues of character have
weakened the league from within like a
virus. Rolle, talent not even considered,
provides the antidote.
It's a useful concept, the microcosm. It
satisfies within us the desire to see everything condensed into something we can
understand, something around which we
can wrap our heads. This means that in a
kick, we see a career. In a game, we see a
season. In the question of Myron Rolle and
his future in football, we see a different
possibility, one that might lead to the
exception and not the rule. Whether his
example will fall into place with all the
others as a microcosm of what is wrong
with the NFL today, and whether Rolle
does end up getting passed over because he
doesn't need the game more than the game
needs him, remain to be decided by the
power that be, doubters among them.
The choice is theirs.

Seniors Walker and Allen play their final game for the Garnet
BY VICTOR BRADY

vbradyl@swarthmore.edu
The

2009-2010 men's basketball season

began with cautious optimism that the
team could contend for a spot in the
Centennial Conference playoffs.
And
though the team will not be competing in
the postseason, the campaign was not without several highlights, as Swarthmore

remained in contention for the fifth and
final playoff berth through the final weeks
of the season.
There were the upset victories over playoff teams Ursinus and Gettysburg, the first
road victory for the men's program in over
three years, the fifth best 3-point field goal
defense in the country, and the seven victories after finishing the 2008-2009 season
with just three.
Though Coach Lee Wimberly and the
entire Garnet squad is disappointed with
the result in the final game of the season, a
71-48 defeat to rival Haverford, he recognizes the steps that the young Garnet took
this year. "I'm glad that we won more
games and were more competitive in the
league," Wimberly said, as the Garnet finished eighth out of 10 teams in the
Centennial Conference after being picked to
finish last.
Standing tall and leading the Garnet
through all of the highs and lows this season were their two senior leaders, Danny
Walker 'lO and Matt Allen 'lO.
Allen and Walker come from opposite
sides of the nation Seattle and New York
respectively
but they have become
extremely close friends through their interaction both on and off the basketball court.
"It has been so much fun and such a
great experience playing with Danny. Not
only is he one of my closest friends here at
Swarthmore, but also he is one of the most
talented players I have ever played," said
Allen, who has also helped to ensure that
everyone on the Garnet has fun while playing competitive basketball. "Danny is very
selective when he wants to impart wisdom
on his teammates, so when he provides
input on things people are sure to listen.
Most importantly, he makes basketball
fun."
Walker has been impressed by Allen's
work ethic, as Allen is one of the most dedicated players in program history in terms
of physical fitness and preparedness.
"When we were first introduced, I knew
Matt was one of those kids with serious
stroke, a sharpshooter," Walker said. "Later
on I was introduced to his work ethic,
which I could tell was substantial because
of the physical results. Guy never misses a
workout, practice or class. He's always
working on trying to get or be better. He has
a competitive attitude on the court, and I
was happy to see another kid working hard
at basketball while going to school."
Allen finishes his career with 710 points
and 138 career 3-pointers, sixth all time in
Swarthmore men's basketball history. But
for all of his offensive success, some of his
most important contributions have come on
the defensive end of the floor. In the two
wins against McDaniel this year, Allen held
the Green Terror's second-leading scorer to
a combined six points.
But these numbers aren't what he
remembers most about his time playing for
the Garnet. "To me, it has been an honor to
play basketball here at Swarthmore. I came
here for the academics, but the friends and
memories I got to enjoy while being a part
of the program have been unbelievable."
Wimberly- is quick to stress the importance that his players are student-athletes.
Students first, athletes second. Allen and
Walker have found the ability to balance
-

their course-load and athletics, excelling
both in the classroom and on the court.
"Basketball can be an important part of the
college experience, but it should never take

precedence over the academics.

The academics are number one. Matt and Danny
have done a good job of that they have had
successful academic careers and have also
had basketball as an important and fun part
of the college experience. That's how it is
supposed to be."
Walker also feels honored to have been a
part of the Garnet for the past four years.
An art major who will have his own exhibition later in the school year, Walker
describes his Swarthmore experience concisely. "Three things I love: learning, making art and playing ball. I got to do all three
-

[at Swarthmore]."

An incredible athlete, Walker has contributed on both ends of the floor as a
tough defender, a strong rebounder and an
acrobatic finisher around the hoop. It was
Walker's reverse lay-up as time expired in
regulation at Washington College earlier
this season that forced overtime against the
Shoremen.
"Danny has always been athletic
and
he had the opportunity [in his junior year]
to show what he could do, and I think that
he had a nice career here," Wimberly said.
Allen added, "Danny's contributions were
so important for our team's success. Danny
is so versatile because he can guard a variety of positions, and he's so hard to guard
one on one. He creates mismatch problems
both offensively and defensively because he
is so quick and strong, and he makes plays
that change the course of games. In the locker room he is a great leader and strong senior presence."
The majority of the Garnet squad will
return for the 2010-2011 campaign and there
is certainly reason to be optimistic going
into the next season. But the absence of
Walker and Allen from the locker room and
from the court will certainly be a challenge
for the team to overcome. Walker and Allen
were leaders by example, often the first
ones onto the court before practice and the
last ones to leave. They both had an uncanny ability to make their teammates laugh
and to quickly analyze the opposition and
make in-game adjustments.
While Walker vividly remembers Allen's
shooting
performance
against
the
Gettysburg Bullets in an upset victory during their junior season (as Allen shot 7 of 13
from the field, 4 of 7 on 3-pointers), Allen
recalls a tournament game in California
when asked about one memory that stands
out from Danny's career.
"My favorite basketball memory of
Danny was from when we were at a tournament in California, and Danny slammed
home a putback dunk after jumping over
and around a defender while being fouled. It
was one of the most athletic plays I've seen
while playing, and put Danny's immense
capability on display."
It was the ability of both seniors to
change the momentum of the game in a
heartbeat whether by a string of Allen
threes or a series of athletic plays by
Walker
that helped to make the two so
invaluable to the team over the past four
-

years.

"Matt and Danny," the crowd repeatedly
chanted at the conclusion of the Garnet's
final game against Haverford, honoring the
hustle, hard work and results that the two
consistently put forth over the past four
years.

And though #3l and #23 have played
their final game in garnet, their contributions will not soon be forgotten by their
teammates, coaches and the entire

Swarthmore community.

Tim Brevart 12 was another college
record-breaker at the conference. His 50yard freestyle race (2L86) earned him a
fifth place finish and the fourth best college record time.
Throughout the meet, the men mainA
tained second place behind Franklin &
Marshall and were able to finish off strong.
For the women, the medal count was not
as high, but they still had several strong
races. The Garnet were again led by Anne
Miller 'lO. Concerning the meet, Miller
said, "The women's team performed quite
well at Conferences. I believe that every-

one got either a season-or lifetime-best
time in at least one of their events. There
were lots of exciting and well-swum
races." Miller also commented on the visibility of the team cohesiveness at conferences. "It was also wonderful to watch
everyone come together, swim as a team,
and cheer their teammates on without fail
throughout the entire weekend."
Two Wednesdays before conferences at
Washington College, Miller broke the
Casey Swim Center record in the 200 butterfly and earned an NCAA B-cut time in
the process. At the final Centennial
Conference of her career, Miller cut down
her 200 fly time by over three seconds
(2:0414) and earned an NCAA A-cut time.
The race was the only one in which a
Swarthmore swimmer, male or female,
won a gold medal. In the race, teammates
Casey Osborn 'lO and Hannah Gotwals 'l3
added to Miller's gold with silver and
bronze finishes, respectively. The three
garnered 53 points in the single race,
which took place on the final day of the
conference.
Another strong race for the women was
the 100 butterfly. Miller again came up in
fine fashion, capturing a silver medal with
a finish of 57.40, which was fast enough for
an NCAA B-cut time. Gotwals took fourth
in 59.66, adding 15 points to the women's
team score. The 800-yard freestyle relay
team captured a fourth place finish in the
last event of day two. The team, consisting
of Claire Shelden 10, Allison Bishop 11,
Chelsea Brett 11 and Miller, finished in
8:05.57, slightly out of medal range.
Miller reflected on her performance.
"Personally, I got lifetime bests in two of

my three individual events. So I think it
was a successful weekend. I am looking

forward to having one more chance to
drop time though."
While the other Garnet swimmers' seasons have concluded, Miller is not done
just yet. The Ail-American, with NCAA
cut times in the two butterfly events, is
headed to Minnesota to compete in the
NCAA Division 111 Championships in two

four weeks away, so the coaches will have
me build back up yardage for a while but
before too long I will be tapering again.
Taper is less yardage and more rest in
order to be well rested for a big meet."
When asked who her biggest motivation in swimming has been, she said it was
the team. "I love going into a race and
knowing that I'm not swimming for
myself, but for the other 18 girls standing
along the pool. L think that because in
swimming everyone is in their own lane,
swimming individually, the team, aspect
gets downplayed. However, being part of a
team, knowing that your team is there for
you and you are swimming for the team,
makes the whole experience so much more
fulfilling and fun."
Miller adds the 200 fly race in which
she, Osborn and Gotwals placed one, two,
three to the list of her favorite memories
while swimming at Swarthmore. One of
her others is the dual meet against F&M
her first year in which both the men and
women won. "It was so much fun tq come
together as a team and the excitement of
the upperclassmen was contagious and
made a lasting impact on how I view and
behave as a member of the Swarthmore
swim team."
She also recalls a 100 fly race as a firstyear in which she and classmate Osborn
broke a minute in the same heat of the
same meet, and a Conference win in the
same event two years ago in which ahe
and then-senior Jennie Lewis tied to qualify for Nationals.
Although Miller has only one more college-level meet to go, she doesn't see herself parting from swimming anytime soon.
"I think I am going to take a break from
competitive swimming but I'm sure I
won't stay out of the pool for too long."

Seniors sent out with win over rival Haverford
BY VICTOR BRADY
vbradyl@swarthmore. edu

The crowd rose to its feet in
a standing ovation as Pam
Costello 'lO and Lisa "Shoey"
Schumacher 'lO exited the floor
of Tarble Pavilion for the final
time in their Swarthmore basketball careers.
The Garnet had battled back
from a three-point halftime
deficit thanks to stellar defense
and efficient offense, en route
to a 50-63 win over rival
Haverford. Costello hit a
pointer, grabbed five rebounds
and came away with a steal,
while Schumacher finished
with a basket, two assists and
another tremendous defensive
performance. As the final horn
sounded, their Swarthmore
basketball journey was com-

plete.

"Being

a part of the

me. Every time I stepped on
the court in a Swarthmore uniform I felt so proud, and I think

that is one of the things I will
miss the most about being a
part of this team," .Costello
said.
Costello, a three-year captain, makes all of her teammates better when on the floor,
and she values the relationships she has been able to create and develop through basketball. "I have had the opportunity to meet and play with a
lot of great players and people
in my time at Swarthmore
Being their teammate has
given me the chance to get to
know them on a whole new

Her teammates also value
the relationship they have been
able to develop with Costello
both on and off the court.
"Pam's leadership has created
a positive and competitive
atmosphere for the entire team,
making us all better players
and teammates to one another,"
Sarah Brajtbord 'll said.
Schumacher cherishes the
progression of the team that
she has helped to lead since her
first year. "As a whole picture,

Costello and Schumacher
have developed a special relationship with each of their
teammates, but the connection
that they have with one another is profound. "Pam and I
have played together four
years. In every game of pick-up
or drill with teams I don't hide
it that I want to be on a team
with her. As a player I trust
Pam to excess. She's solid. I
really like that while she is
emotionally invested she is
steady as a rock," Schumacher
said.
Indeed, this steadiness was
apparent earlier this season as
Costello hit two free throws in
the second overtime to seal a
road win at Franklin and
Marshall. Both Schumacher
and Coach Renee DeVarney
cite this game as standing out
from the other 93 games in
Costello's stellar career.
"At F&M, Pam shot very
well, but in that game, she did
everything
had rebounds,
assists, steals. It really was a
great game for her," Devarney
said.
Indeed, Costello finished
four of six from behind the
three-point arc and added three
assists, six rebounds, two steals
and a block. As Schumacher
said, "Poised under pressure:
that's Pam on the court."
This poise hasn't been lost

this
for
Swarthmore and according to
Costello, "I could not have
asked for someone better to
share my basketball time at
Swat with. We share so many
values when it comes to basketball and the team and that has
made it so easy to get along as
teammates and co-leaders."
Costello's favorite thing
about
Schumacher?
Schumacher's ability to bring a
smile to the face of each of her

teammates.

In the opening game of the

year, Schumacher had one of
the best games in her career,
finishing with 14 points on six

for 11 shooting.
Though the Garnet fell in
that game to the College of New
Jersey, Schumacher's performance set the tone for her contributions to the women's basketball team all season long.
"[Schumacher's] work ethic
is so important to the team.
Shoey's a worker. Every day,
she finishes close to the front of
every sprint, she goes hard in
every drill, and her intensity is
always there. She isn't afraid
of taking charges and getting
beat up [on the floor]. She's
just tough," DeVarney said.
Though the Garnet returns
much of their core headed into
the 2010-2011, season, they will
be missing the heart Costello
and Schumacher.
"You don't have to explain a
lot to them
they can assess a
situation, pick up on it, and
move quickly," DeVarney said.
"I'm going to miss the [connection] that we had between the
three of us and their quick
assessments of all situations."
