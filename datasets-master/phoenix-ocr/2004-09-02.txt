Three strikes and you're out
Students hosting copyrighted files now risk fine, loss of employment and disconnection from the network

gsheldol@swarthmore.edu
A new "three strikes" policy has
been established by the college for
students whose online file sharing
prompts multiple "take-down" warnings from the Recording Industry
Association of America or other

copyright watchdogs.
The
policy,
according

to

Information Technology Services
Director Judy Downing, is simply a
formalization of existing practices. A
first offense will result in a warning,
while a second notice will result in a
fine and loss of on-campus employment. A third warning will prompt
ITS to revoke the offender's network
access indefinitely.
The official policy became necessary because for the first time last
year, the coUege received repeated
"take-down" notices for the same student, who ignored ITS's requests to
remove the copyrighted material in
question, Downing said.
ITS notified the Dean's Office of
the incident, leading former Dean
Tedd Goundie to impose a fine on the
student. A few months later, the
same student was again implicated
in sharing copyrighted files and was
suspended from the network.
ITS does not actively police the
network for file sharing but will

enforce the policy only in cases
where it is notified of sharing by an
outside source.
ITS would also take action to stop
file sharing whose bandwidth
requirements were making the network unusable, but that to date
"there has never been enforcement
not initiated by an outside letter,"
Downing said. Students implicated

in sharing of copyrighted material
are given 10 days to declare "fair
use," a claim which would then be
evaluatedby a college copyright committee, before penalties are imposed.

Last year, when Internet peer-topeer file sharing was disabled by ITS
for network performance reasons,
students took to sharing files within
the Swarthmore network using
downloadable programs like Direct
Connect, which some students
assumed to operate only within the
Swarthmore network. Still, Downing
said ITS received multiple warnings
which implicated Direct Connect

users.

"Evidently, there is not a way to
share only within this domain,"

Downing said.
The new policy imposes harsher

on ITS student employees
than other students. ITS employees
can lose their jobs upon their first

ensure that no firewalls are oper-

Students react to RNC,
some attend protests
BY REUBEN

HEYMAN-KANTOR AND

SUE CHEN

rheymanl@swarthmore.edu and schenl@swarthmore.edu
Several hundred thousand protesters descended on New
York City this week to voice their complaints and frustrations
with the policies of the Bush administration as the Republican
Party kicked off its four-day national convention at Madison
Square Garden.
While substantial numbers of Swarthmore students have
gone to similar large-scale protests against government policy
in the past, only a handful of students traveled to New York this
year, partly because the event occurred during the first week of

classes.

Fliers could be seen around campus last week encouraging
students to attend the march, but the effort to bring people to
the Republican National Convention protest was miniscule in
comparison to the efforts surrounding the anti-war protests a
year and a half ago in New York, Philadelphia, and

Washington.
Alec Armstrong 'O7 attended the march and put up some of
the fliers announcing the protest, but he did not organize firstyears to attend with him.
"I thought it would be a bad idea to be responsible for bringing up first-years the night before their first day of college,
especially to something where people could potentially be
arrested," he said.
Despite this, Armstrong felt the protests were productive.
"The parts that I saw were really great... There were more people than I could physically see. Everything that I saw was really peaceful and well-spirited," he said.
Armstrong said he went to the march because he finds
Bush's policies harmful, and that the protesters' concerns cross
party lines.

"Mobilizing half a million people to say they disagree with
what's going on is useful, because those people will come out
and show their disapproval of any similar policies if the
Democrats were to enact them," Armstrong said.
Other students have voiced their support for the protests
while still here at Swarthmore, but were not able to attend.
"I thought [the protest] was a solid expression of people
against the Bush administration and its policies," Patrick Hart
'O6, a College Democrats member, said. "I would like to go. I
suppose I'm not the biggest protester, but, if I were to go, that
would be the place." But, Hart added, "I have a lot of things [to
do] here."
Thomas Showalter 'O6, another College Democrats member,

echoed Hart's sentiments.

"I think [the protests] are great. I really want to go myself.
It's too bad they're the day before classes started. I don't know
how much it'll affect the election, but it's good to see people out
there to protest and rebel," he said.

There were more people than I could
physically see. Everything that I saw
was really peaceful and well-spirited.
Alec Armstrong 'O7
There were more people than I could physically see.
Everything that I saw was really peaceful and well-spirited.
"I'm more of a Democrat supporter, so I'm sympathetic to
those protests. I think it's important that the convention isn't
conducted without some dissent, because I don't think the
Republicans should get free reign over the media," David Lovit
'O6 said.
Students who have been following coverage of the convention itself emphasize the Republican party's attempts to rally

bi-partisan voters.
"I think [the convention] is basically to put a moderate spin

on Bush's policies...by showcasing moderate Republicans like
McCain and Schwarzenegger," Hart said.
"I think the RNC is like the DNC, really tightly choreographed...They're working really hard to be moderate,"
Showalter said.

"The Republican party is definitely trying to appeal to moderate voters and emphasize President Bush's traits that will
appeal to individuals across party lines," Maria Macia 'O7, a
College Republicans member, said.
"I think the protesters are exercising their right to express
their opinion," she added.
As of the time of publication, no Swarthmore student was
reported arrested at the Republican National Convention
protests.

Thousands gather in New
York to protest convention

marchers, Elephants Against Republicans, donned elephant noses and cardboard ears.
The anti-Bush contingent did not have a monopoly

(U-WIRE) NEW YORK
Citing issues ranging from
gay rights to the war in Iraq, from outsourced labor to
curtailed liberties, hundreds of thousands of protesters
marched Sunday in the stifling heat to protest the
arrival of the Republican National Convention in New
York City.
The march, organized by United for Peace and
Justice, wound its way up through Chelsea beginning
at noon, lingering as it passed the convention site at
Madison Square Garden on West 34th Street.
The final contingent of the march arrived six hours
later at Union Square Park, and tens of thousands of
protesters marched farther still to Central Park's
Great Lawn for a rally.
On Seventh Avenue, protesters filled the air with
drums, whistles and horns, and chanted anti-Bush slogans. People danced in the street and waved placards
with slogans like "There's dirt under every Bush" and
"George Bush is not my Friendster," while a flock of
helicopters monitored the march from above.
"I've never seen a protest in New York quite like
this," NYU senior Arielle Bier said.
"It was so well organized, and people were working
together. It was more colorful than any protest I've
seen in the U.5.," Bier added.
The war in Iraq proved the dominant issue among
protesters.
Hundreds of cardboard coffins-draped with U.S.
flags and black cloth were carried through the streets
in remembrance of the nearly 1,000 soldiers and civil-

on satirical protest.
One group of pro-Bush counter-protestors held
satirical signs, such as one depicting a machine gunwielding likeness of Che Guevara. The sign read: "War
is not the answer
unless you're a socialist guerilla."
Boulder, Colo, resident Robert Martindale, who
supported anti-war presidential candidate Dennis
Kucinich, said he wasn't marching "necessarily to
change the Republican delegates' minds, just to show
them that there's another way."
He said he planned to invite delegates to coffee to
discuss the course the country is taking and break
down the two-dimensional stereotypes perpetuated by
each side.
"I don't want Ann Coulter to define me, and I'm
sure they don't want Michael Moore defining them,"
Martindale said.
A large portion of the more than 10,000 New York
City police officers assigned to secure the convention
lined the streets along the march route.
In total, more than 200 protesters were arrested,
mostly for disorderly conduct, police said.
Early Sunday afternoon, 53 protesting cyclists were
detained on West 37th Street and Seventh Avenue.
They were splayed out, hands cuffed behind their
backs, in a street littered with bicycles and thick with

ians who have lost their lives in Iraq so far.
"I just hope that it's a dose of reality," said one pallbearer, an architect from the Upper West Side who
identified himself as William. "I think people will feel
the loss of life personally [when they see the coffins]."
Taking a more light-hearted approach, one group of

police.

One cyclist said the group, which had left from
Union Square in support of the march, was swarmed
and bumped by plainclothes police on scooters, herded onto 37th Street, pushed off their bikes and arrested.
"They think that if they do a good job this weekend,
they'll get a raise," said Chris Habib, 29, referring to
ongoing contract negotiations between the city and

police and firefighter unions.

Guiliani, McCain kick off RNC with
speeches addressing war in Iraq
BY JAMEEL NAQVI
MICHIGAN DAILY (U. MICHIGAN
(U-WIRE) NEW YORK
An
estimated 50,000 Republicans from
all 50 states gathered in Madison
Square Garden Monday night for
the first evening session of their
national convention, following
their ceremonial nomination of

President George Bush.
The four-day convention was

inaugurated with speeches that
highlighted Monday's theme, "A
Nation of Courage."
Former New York City Mayor

Rudy

Giuliani and Sen.

John

McCain, R-Ariz., praised President
Bush's actions in the aftermath of
the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks in

their keynote addresses.
Democrats have criticized the
lineup of speakers at the convention as a parade of moderate
Republicans whose views do not
align closely with those of the
Bush/Cheney ticket. Republicans
have responded that the speakers

reflect the diversity of opinion
within the party.

Such a shift along the political

spectrum is consistent with the
race to the center that has tradi-

tionally occurred after the primary season concludes, when candidates must appeal to a broader
audience.

September 2, 2004

McCain, a

moderate policy

maker and former presidential candidate, addressed the ongoing war

in Iraq.
"After years of failed diplomacy
and limited military pressure to
Hussein,
restrain
Saddam
President Bush made the difficult
decision to liberate Iraq," he said,
alluding to the failure of Clintonera policies to weaken Saddam's
regime.

"Whether or not Saddam possessed the terrible weapons he once
had and used, freed from international pressure and the threat of

military action, he would have
acquired them again," he said.
"I commend to my country the
re-election of President Bush, and
the steady, experienced, publicspirited man who serves as our
Cheney,"
Dick
vice-president,

McCain added.
The war also became Giuliani's
most stinging point of criticism of
Sen. John Kerry.
Giuliani criticized Kerry for his
decisions during a procedural vote
on a defense-spending package.
"My point about John Kerry
being inconsistent is best described
in his own words when he said, T
actually did vote for the $B7 billion

before I voted against it.' Maybe
this explains John Edwards' need
one where
for two Americas

John Kerry can vote for something
and another where he can vote
against the same thing," Giuliani
said.
"President Bush sees world terrorism for the evil that it is. John
Kerry has no such clear, precise
and consistent vision," he said.
While united with their party on
criticism of Kerry, both primetime
speakers have distanced themselves from the party and the Bush
administration on several issues
during their political careers.
McCain has worked closely with

both John Edwards and Kerry.
Monday night, McCain was
again

conciliatory,

calling

Democratic lawmakers his allies
against the common enemies of

democracy.

McCain has gained respect from
Democrats for crossing party lines
by fighting for campaign finance
reform, even when such measures
have distanced him from some

Republicans.
Giuliani gained national visibility when he led New York during
per haps the most difficult period in
its history.
But, he has withheld his support
of Bush's proposed federal marriage amendment.
Giuliani also disagrees with
Bush's checks on stem cell
research.

Goundie leaves Dean's Office for Bates
Westphal steps up as associate dean of student life, leaving assistant dean position open
nally] rather than a broad way," he said.

BY REUBEN HEYMAN-KANTOR

rheymanl@swarthmore.edu

Tedd Goundie, the former associate dean for student life,
announced in mid-June that he would accept a position as
dean of students at Bates College, leaving Swarthmore with a
high-level vacancy just two months before students returned
to campus.

Instead of beginning a formal, national search to replace
the administration decided to promote Myrt
Westphal, formerly assistant dean and director of residential
life, to the position.
The college decided to perform an informal search, because
Goundie accepted Bates' offer so late in the summer. Unlike
the formal process, the search did not include discussing the
appointment with Student Council, bringing outside candidates to campus or creating a formal hiring body.
"[We made the decision for] two reasons. One is that we
would be seriously compromised if we went through a semester without that position being filled," Dean Bob Gross '62 said.
"The other reason is that we felt we had an internal candidate
who was superbly qualified for the position."
Westphal has been working in the student life section of the
Dean's office, which advises students, organizes housing and
freshman orientation, holds disciplinary hearings and deals
with other non-academic student concerns, for 15 years. She
served in her previous role as director of residential life and
coordinator for disability services since 1993.
Westphal's long tenure with the college was the greatest
reason why she was promoted to associate dean.
"I have real confidence in Myrt to pick up the reigns," Vice
President Maurice Eldridge '6l said. "When you know you
have people on your staff who are good, experienced, committed, you want the option to post the job in a limited way [interGoundie,

Eldridge added that he was confident Westphal would have
been given the job even if it had been open to a national search.
If you have a strong internal candidate, he said, "Do you need
to go that route?"
Bates posted the job opening in March and offered the job
to Goundie in mid-June. "I'd have preferred that it didn't happen so quickly, but I certainly kept the people that needed to

know in the loop," Goundie said.
Still, the decision to leave was one Goundie had been considering for some time. "I decided I wanted to be on senior staff
and report to the president," Goudie said. "I wanted to try a
new place, to take what I learned at Swarthmore and see what
they do at other places."
"It was where I was in my own career, my family. I was not
doing a hardcore search. When Bates invited me to look at the
college I didn't know how interested I would be, but when I
came I -thought it would be a good fit. I just wanted a new
adventure," he said.
Goundie had been working in the Dean's office since 1988,
and had been the associate dean for student life since 1996.
Westphal officially took over for Goundie on Aug. 1, but the
college has not yet found a replacement for the position she is
vacating. "There will be a more open search" for a new assistant dean, Gross said. "We have more time to go through a
process."
Gross said he hoped that the position would be filled by late
fall, when housing must be organized for students returning
from abroad and freshmen who have deferred for a semester.
In the meantime, Westphal is both working as associate
dean of student life and retaining her previous responsibilities
as assistant dean. "Right now [the toughest part] is doing two
jobs," Westphal said of her new role. "The housing piece and
the disabilities piece are very active through the first two

weeks ofclass."
Beyond that, Westphal will be handling Goundie's old
responsibilities, including supporting the activities office and
running RA training. Last year, Goundie and Westphal ran the
training together.
"This is an exciting opportunity," Westphal said. "I think
anyone would acknowledge the housing job is one of the toughest around, but there are parts I will miss. I really enjoyed
matching freshman roommates."

Swat ranked second, but who cares?
College officials express 'mixed feelings' about the influence of U.S. News list
BY SUE CHEN

schenl@swarthmore.edu
Swarthmore tied Amherst for second place among liberal arts schools in the U.S. News & World Report's latest

annual ranking of colleges, moving up from its number
three ranking last year.
College officials, however, look at the report with skepticism, pointing out that the criteria by which schools are
judged do not reflect the intangible factors important to
the undergraduate experience.

The magazine, which has ranked Williams first for two
years in a row, used up to 15 "indicators of academic quality," including acceptance rates, faculty salary, graduation
rate and alumni giving, to determine a school's placement.
"There's a big assumption there that selectivity,
resources, reputation and whatever indices [U.S. News
uses] make a particular school right for a particular student," Dean of the College Bob Gross '62 said.
For example, Gross pointed out that the average faculty
salary at one school may be higher than another simply
because it has professors with more seniority, "but does
that make it a better school?"
Of course, having a high ranking in the magazine translates into free publicity for Swarthmore.
"I have mixed feelings [about the rankings]," Dean of
Admissions and Financial Aid Jim Bock '9O said. "I'm
grateful we're there because it increases our visibility,
especially for international students, [but do the rankings]
say anything about the college? I'm not so sure."
Some students, like Nick Zeifang 'OB, may never have
heard of Swarthmore without U.S. News. In his native
Germany, Zeifang consulted the magazine's rankings to
learn more about American universities.
"I looked at the top 10 schools. That's how I found out
about Swarthmore," Zeifang said.
Awo Aboagye 'OB was a high school student in Britain
when she heard a presentation by a Swarthmore admissions
counselor. "Afterwards, I checked U.S. News. I was pleased.
[Swarthmore] was one of the top three schools," she said.
Others did not find the rankings to be as helpful or
influential in the college search process.
"I saw [the rankings and] I don't think it affected my
decision much," Erin Marten, a Massachusetts native,
said. "If you look at the top 20 schools, you know that
they're all top schools. The difference between number one
and number 10 isn't so great."
While aware of Swarthmore's change in the rankings,

Prospective students and parents, like those pictured above, are the intended audience of U.S. News
Report's annual rankings.
"I would have to say [they influenced me] almost not at
all," prospective student Oliver Shultz, a New York City
native, said. "My initial list was propelled by the rankings
to a certain extent, but the more you look at a school, the
less meaningful the rankings become."
"I think it's great that Swat ranked second I think it's
good to have high numbers, but it's more the way a student
interacts with a school that matters," Shultz added.
"When my son was younger, [the ranking] was the only
source I knew about," said Youngsoo Cho as she waited for
her son to finish an admissions interview. "Now, we visit the
colleges."

Little has changed in Swarthmore's statistics in the
past year, and Bock said the admissions numbers have
remained the same.
Bock and Gross said the change in rankings from year
to year is a ploy U.S. News uses to get people to buy more
magazines.

"Colleges and universities

are like 1,000-foot oil tankers

[they don't] change very quickly
so [U.S. News] tweaks
the criteria so schools end up in different places," Gross said.
"Many of us in higher education absolutely deplore the
ranking, but are absolutely powerless to do anything about
them. So we live with it," he added.

Swarthmore students won top honors in a
national competition in San Jose, Calif.,
continuing the college's five-year winning

streak in the event.
Frederick Heckel 'O5, Nicolas Ward 'O5
and engineering professor Bruce Maxwell
competed in the American Association for

Artificial Intelligence's competition,
which was held July 27-29. Along with
them were two robots, Frodo and Gollum,
named after J.R.R. Tolkien's characters.
Frodo and Gollum are two circular
Real World Interface Magellan robots, no
taller than one's knee, Ward said.
Each is equipped with a pan/tilt camera, shotgun microphone, sonar and
infrared sensors, an onboard Linux workstation, and wireless Ethernet.
Frodo and Gollum competed in the
competition's urban search-and-rescue
category, run by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology, as they have
each year.
The arena for this category is a maze
resembling the floor of an office building
after an earthquake or other disaster,
Heckel said.
"There's paper, rubble and chicken
wire all over the place," said Heckel.
"Hidden throughout are manikins that are
either moving, yelling for help or staying
still."
Frodo and Gollum's task was to identify as many of these "victims" as possible

and to classify them as unconscious, semiconscious, or conscious, Ward said.
Points were awarded for the number of
victims each robot recognized and classified, and points were deducted for bumping into hazards on the floor.
"We did this using a first-person,
videogame-style interface," Ward said.

Using the pan/tilt camera and microphone, whose signals are picked up by the
wireless Ethernet, the robot's operator
can see and hear 360 degrees around the
robot.
"It's a lot of fun," Ward said. "Like
playing with toys."

The competition draws participants
from several colleges and universities,
including the University of New Orleans
and Utah State University, as well as private and government organizations.
The Mitre Corporation and Xerox Park,
two private businesses, won second and

third place, respectively.

Both presented machines with hardware far more expensive than those used
on Frodo and Gollum.
"We were most excited about beating
Mitre," which is a Department of Defense
research lab, Heckel said. "It was a moral

victory."

Unlike Frodo and Gollum, Mitre's
robots used laser technology to create a
detailed map of the arena, Ward said. The
driver could then locate victims as if looking at the floor from a bird's eye view.
Despite this disadvantage to Heckel
and Ward, who had to draw maps of the
arena by hand, Frodo and Gollum won

twice as many points as the Mitre team in
the final round, Heckel said.
Heckel and Ward have been programming and designing robots since their
sophomore years. They both spent the
summer of 2003 working on Maxwell's
robots.

With Maxwell, they hope to display
Frodo, Gollum and a similar robot, Sam,
in Hicks Hall within the next two weeks.

Attendees will be allowed to drive the
robots themselves.
The robots were originally given to
Maxwell in 1999 and 2000, respectively, as
awards for winning the same contest in
those years.
The robots have been completely reprogrammed since the 2003 competition in
Acapulco, Mexico, where the same team
won second place, Maxwell said.

Cygnet

Fast-growing site, inspired by Friendster, allows college students to connect online
BY MELISSA PHRUKSACHART
mphruksl@swarthmore.edu

At a school as small as Swarthmore, the people-watching can get dull pretty quickly. After a semester or two,
you can be fairly confident that you have registered
almost every Swattie's face. However, there is now a new
venue for idle messaging and innocuous stalking: the-

facebook. com.

This social networking website for elite college students has finally arrived at Swarthmore after being available only to Ivy League schools and a few large universities since its February 2004 inception. Thefacebook,
which asks students to create detailed personal profiles
and allows them to search for friends, was made available
to Swarthmore College students in late August. Since
then, more than 300 current Swatties have signed up
meaning over 20 percent of the campus has indulged at
least once in the guilty pleasures of narcissistic profilemaking, personal photo posting, peer profile-critiquing,
-

crush analyzing, and all-around obsessive collecting of
"friends."

"You sign up, and you get friends.
You scroll and look at them: 'l've got
this many friends.' It's pretty boring
after a while."
Jason Lee 'O6
The phenomenon began at Harvard University in
a wired.com article. Mark
Zuckerberg, then a sophomore at Harvard, created the
January 2004, according to

site to allow his fellow classmates to connect to one

another by listing their interests, classes and activities.
Thefacebook soon exploded in popularity at Harvard and
was launched to the public in February 2004. First to be
added were the other Ivy League schools, followed by
large universities and liberal arts colleges. Thefacebook
network now includes 57 institutions, ranging from Yale

University to Swarthmore to the University of Virginia.
The format of the site is similar to the popular social
networking website friendster.com, with a few collegiate
twists. After the user is registered, he or she creates a
profile containing "my contact info," "my personal info,"
"my summer plans," "my courses" and more. There is
space for users to provide details as personal (and sala-

cious, by Swat standards) as sexual preferences, relationship status, political views, course schedules and dorm
rooms. Many users choose to include pictures as well.
Fortunately, with such intimate details floating
around, security at Thefacebook is tight. Unless users
have added one another as friends, they can access only
others' names, pictures and schools.
To find "friends," users input names and can search
not only by college but high school as well. Most users'
lists of friends contain a mix of schools, broadening their
social networks. For those pessimistic about the Quaker
Matchbox, this is a valuable resource. For others,
Thefacebook allows them to get to know Swatties they

may only know by face more intimately. "I think
Thefacebook is convenient because it's part of the
Swarthmore community. It's a more detailed Cygnet,"
Wee Chua 'O6 said.
After that, there isn't much else. Users can message
each other, search for new friends, and keep up with each
other's profiles. Thefacebook also includes a curious
option called "Poking." Each profile has a link saying,
"Poke him/her!" If you choose to poke someone, they
receive an alert saying that you have poked them. Their
only option is either to ignore it or to poke you back.

Nothing more and nothing less—leaving some users disappointed by Thefacebook's limited capabilities. "You
sign up, and you get friends. You scroll and look at them:

'l've got this many friends.' It's pretty boring after a

while," Jason Lee 'O6 said.
The biggest complaint about Thefacebook has been its
redundancy. The SCCS-run Cygnet is already a handy
directory that matches people's faces to their names. Due
to Swarthmore's size, most Swatties are already familiar
faces, and even the most intimate details posted on
Thefacebook would not be difficult to retrieve through
word of mouth, especially at such a tight-knit community as Swarthmore's. Ultimately, Thefacebook is just
another time-waster, as addictive and shallow as the similarly structured friendster.com. But due to its ease, its
hip technological aspect, and its underlying sense of
exclusivity, Thefacebook has for now become the hottest
way to collect friends and keep track of potentially new

ones.

Atkinson, Martin, and Reid-Schwartz are all wellhoned in their particular brand ofatmospheric concert
performance and improvisation, proven in the album's
best and longest track, "The Misprint in the Gutenberg

betray the overall growth of the piece or the expected
droning climax of guitars, mysterious voice, and spaceship sound effects. Instead, by minute 1£ or so, the trio
has already given the listener an active interest in the
track's completion.
The shorter accompanying tracks on the album
were all recorded in either a studio or the band's practice space and seem to suffer from alack of direction,
perhaps because of the absence of a live audience's
input and/or the freedom to let the piece develop untimed. Tracks such as "Bulky Knit Cheerleader

It's probably wrong to compare dirty Chicago blues

well to adopt some of Taylor's enthusiasm and energy

tracks that reflect an actual build in mood and performance. Even before he starts playing his slow blues

because with it comes the promise of movement and

nameless and enigmatic society. When a 15-year old Annie
asked where she could find a pair, the salesman at Frank's
Shoes gave her the address of a store on the West Side
(we're talking Minneapolis here) and the advice to bring "a

But fear not, male friends: Frank's now sells Converse

No. No you wouldn't. If we learned anything from School
House Rock, it's that Knowledge Is Power. The enjoyment
we derive from such private enthusiasms comes not only
from the genuine pleasure they bring, but from the power
they give us to lord our sophistication over others. When
everyone is already in on it, the fun of sagely recommending the third track on the second album is gone. And since
you can never prove you were the first, no one will ever
believe your crazy story about "inventing the Internet."

In a curiously post-something twist, one of the most recent
successful marketing strategies is "non-marketing": invisibly appealing to those who like to think of themselves as
"above" trends and other plebian concerns (otherwise
known as Swarthmore students
and Phoenix fashion
columnists). Future MBAs, take note: as a story in Fast
Company magazine reported, blue-collar-turned-indie beer
brand Pabst Blue Ribbon is now considered to be the second
fastest-growing beer in the U.S., after two decades of declining sales. The turnaround point? A campaign that capitalized on Pabst's underground buzz without killing it. The
beer's authenticity was already established in independent
circles; all it took was some well-targeted prodding (and free
beer) to prompt Pabst's many "discoverers" to enlighten others and then bask in their own originality.
Hey, we're not criticizing this insidious practice. We use
it as a cheap way to get half-hearted smirks of recognition.
Besides Pabst, how many of our name-dropping pop cultural references did you recognize in this column? And didn't
you feel cool when you did? If you got all 16, you're in.

INSIDE THE CONSTRUCTION
THE PARRISH RENOVATIONS

MOVING ADMISSIONS
The

Parrish renovation has produced wide-scale
changes to the building's interior structure. Parrish
Parlours, the hall's two central staircases and the
Community Resource Center are all closed. The admissions
office, WSRN and the campus' ATM have changed locations. The $13.6 million project, funded by the Meaning of
Swarthmore, began this summer and will continue through
September 2005.
Disturbances from construction are already affecting
Parrish residents. Construction lasts from 7 a.m. to 3:30
p.m., Monday to Friday.

Sarah Gaertner 'O5, who lives on the third floor,
described the construction noise as "obnoxious." She
added that on Monday morning, she was awakened every
hour on the hour beginning at 8 a.m. because of hammering from below her room.
Her neighbors were also bothered. Gaertner said all of
them could pinpoint the construction by feeling for the
vibrations in the floor. Fortunately, at their first hall meeting,
the residents were told they can request revisions of the
workers' schedule.

that facilitates intra-faculty communication.

Is this new craze in star political power a genuine call
for activism and change, or just another fleeting trend?
Recently, the Democratic National Convention in Boston
proved to be spectacularly star-studded. On top of political celebrities, Hollywood celebs like Ben Affleck,
Leonardo DiCaprio and John Cusack came to support

their candidates of choice. The Republican National
Convention, which started on August 30 in New York
City, is sure to pack some powerhouse stars as well.
While some of these celebrities seem to have genuine
interest and knowledge in the upcoming election, others

persistently urged viewers to "get out and vote" in an
effort to encourage the younger demographic to enact their

civil duties.
MTV's heart was more or less in the right place, but
the plan took a turn for the worse when former TRL host
Carson Daly introduced Alexandra and Vanessa Kerry,
daughters of presidential hopeful John Kerry. The two
were met with mixed reactions from the audience,
including a loud chorus of boos. Moments later, the Bush
twins, Barbara and Laura, appeared on screen via satellite to say they were too busy with their father's cam-

may just be caught up in the surrounding hype. After all,
when November 2 has long past, most stars will go about
their careers, and the fight to raise political awareness
may very well dissipate as quickly as Ugg boots did.
But at last Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards, typically known for its jaw-dropping antics, it seemed that
every other move was an attempt to turn a night of fun
into a political smorgasbord. Held in Miami to dodge the

audience, both sets of sisters slipped in not-too-subtle
"By the way, vote for my dad!" plugs. At any other show
(that doesn't honors its winners with "Moonmen"), this
may have been appropriate. However, coming off the

Philadelphia Fringe Festival offers cutting-edge art, theater

The
Philadelphia Fringe Festival
promises to be 16 days of cutting
edge art, featuring music, dance,
theater, visual arts, and spokenword performances from a
plethora

of

unconventional

artists.
The Fringe has its roots in
Edinburgh
Scotland's

International Festival where
performers excluded from the
mainstream (referred to as the
"fringe") started their own.

In the 1980s the event crossed
the Atlantic, first infiltrating
Canada, then America.
Now there are festivals in
New York City, Minneapolis,
Montreal, and Toronto among

others.
Philadelphia's

Fringe

Festival has been around since
1997 and continues to grow each
year, lasting longer this year
than ever before in order to accomodate a new experimental film
program.
There are two types of shows
in the Festival.
First are the official shows,
those coordinated and scheduled

by the Fringe staff.

The second type of show is the

unfiltered fringe, those shows
that are programmed and promoted by the artists themselves.

These acts allow the Festival
to encompass a far greater range
of work, nearly doubling the
number of events held during

the festival.
The blurring of boundaries
and artistic cross pollination are

Festival's offerings than mightnormally do so.
The almost 700 presentations
that are part of the Fringe
Festival are featured not only in
conventional arts venues but
also in bookstores, coffee shops,

street corners, cars, galleries,
cabarets, community centers,

parks, and restaurants.

No venue is safe from the
artistic spirit of the Festival.

The majority of events are
located in the Old City area. A

To most Swarthmore students, that
means another round of the same
Sharpies food you've had before, or if
you're one of those bright-eyed frosh, it's
the first time around with menus you'll

soon memorize. Eating lunch out is an
effective way to save money while still
enjoying the attentive service and tantalizing food of a professional waitstaff and
chef. Most restaurants try to get a busi-

Iron Hill Brewery in Media provides
some really juicy burgers (if you can talk
them into making them rare) and, for
those of you of age, seasonal beers.
Steaks, seafood and poultry are also quite
good, but they'll stretch your budget a bit
more. John Harvard's, which many of you
have seen right next to Border's and
Genuardi's, is a similar place to get tasty
bar food and fresh beer, but the vicinity to
campus means that most of you upperclassmen will have already eaten there
often enough to take away the novelty.
Iron Hill's worth the trip, if only for a
change of scenery and a new set of taps.
Right across the street from Iron Hill
Brewery is Margaret Cho's Peking Tokyo,

Fellini's Cafe Trattoria, just a bit further up Main Street, serves up some pretty
good authentic Italian food, right down to
the buffalo mozzarella Caprese and Penne
Puttanesca. Though the decor and atmos-

phere can be a little stereotypical, especially with the popularity of the Sopranos on
HBO every week (Monday nights offer live

opera), the food just can't be argued with.
You can call ahead to order flowers for
your table, if you're looking to make your
time away from Swat a bit more memorable. It's a family-run place, so they'll go

you'll probably like just as much. The
Japanese food is the real reason to go, and
be sure to check their eraseable-markerboard on top of the sushi bar for daily specials. I'm particularly fond of the "Happy

but delicious. Peking Tokyo's sushi and

Long-term relationships: It's all about compromise
First of all, we want to clarify something: despite what
you may think, this column is not about sex. Rather, it rep-

resents opinions on the various decisions we Swatties
have to make in terms of friendships, daily interactions,
and even some things as seemingly insignificant as AIM
messages. Our aim is simply to provide an insight into
relationships at Swarthmore.

ETAN COHEN
CHELSEA FERRELL
Kosher Sex

So let's start with a general idea. Relationships. How
are they created? How do they develop? Most importantly,
though, how do they survive? Many, many people begin
relationships. There are plenty of Swarthmore couples
who have been going out for a couple weeks, even months.
But what is it that sustains a relationship longer? What
sets a few relationships apart from the rest and makes
them more successful, more fulfilling for the individuals

involved?
The answer is simple: compromise. What makes the
relationship work on an everyday level is the act of compromise
the ability of each individual to relinquish
some personal freedom for the good of the couple.
Compromise is very different from sacrifice. If you want to
have a long-term relationship, you don't necessarily have
to sacrifice everything you like to do and spend all your
time with a person. In fact, this could quickly cause the
relationship to fail. If one person gives up too much, and
each does not relinquish the same amount of independence, like a see-saw, the relationship can easily become
lopsided and hit the ground, ultimately failing.
So how does this apply to you, here at Swarthmore?
What do you have to compromise? Not a job, not money,
and not any of your food. But there is something that you
do have to compromise. Independence. Trust. Your standards and even your principles. If you cannot compromise
at least some of this, if you are not willing to work to balance with the other person's values, time schedules, and

THE

PHOENIX

habits, then you can never have the kind of relationships
we're talking about. This can be especially difficult at
Swarthmore, where the demands of academics compete
with friendships, sports, clubs and the little nuances of
everyday life (showering, eating, sleeping) and make the
time to have to yourself— your free time extremely limited and precious. In this environment, the first question
you should be asking yourself is: Do you actually want that
type of relationship?
Option 1: Yes, you do. You want a relationship with a
person you can talk to for hours
one that is based on personality and not solely on physical attraction.
Option 2: Nah, I don't really care. All I want is someone
with whom I can go out with and simply have fun with.
Ideally, with no emotions attached
just parties and pleas-

ure.

Go with the flow. Seize the day. Live.
Try not to be a typical Swattie and
overanalyze everything

type you'd like to be in and are ready for.
It would be impossible to expect you to blindly trust
every person you enter a relationship with. On the other
hand, if you question their trust constantly, the relationship will be rendered nonexistent. So after you decide to
enter into a relationship, put trust aside and see if you two
can get along and can have fun together. Go with the flow.
Seize the day. Live. Try not to be a typical Swattie and
overanalyze everything (as impossible as that may seem).
Don't think about the end product; don't even think of

as a "product"
because that never contributes to a healthy relationship at the beginning stages.
After you get to know the person better and are given the
opportunity to take whatever you two have further, you
simply look at the past, get a sense if that compromise is
possible, and decide on whether you want to keep it as it is,
cut things off, or go further.
That's it for this week! If you have any questions, conwe'd love to
cerns, or issues you'd like us to talk about
hear them. Until then, keep smiling!

yourselves

swarthmore.edu

Option 3: I want to be alone. (If Option 3 is the case
why on earth are you reading this column?)
Emotions are involved in both options one and two.
Having any type of relationship involves a certain amount
of risk. You have to be able to make choices about the
demands on your time. Before you enter any relationship,
you have to be comfortable with yourself and your place in
the relationship, and be sure you have enough trust in the
other person to be able to compromise when necessary.
You also have to think about what you're getting into
because the choices you make are going to have a great
impact on someone else, someone you presumably care
about, even if only at a basic level.
Usually, the lines are fuzzy and blurred between the
three options; we're not trying to say these are the only
types of relationships, they're just three basic trends we've
noticed at Swarthmore. We're also not trying to say one is
necessarily better than another, only that you should
reflect on which type of relationship you're in and which

In on the game
There have been plenty of political battles fought
about young people, where middle-aged candidates tried
to convince middle-aged voters that they would be qualified to look out for their children's interests. Now, the
candidates are middle-aged, and will be while Article 11,
Section I of the Constitution remain law, but for the 2004
election we college-aged youths are increasingly the peoand increasingly the
ple to whom they're speaking
ones speaking on their behalf.
People our age, once seen as a demographic rendered
utterly ineffectual by either cynical apathy or naive idealism, are now players in the political game. And it may
end up changing us as much as we end up changing it.
The change has occurred in people of all political
stripes, but the most obvious pattern has been a shift
in attitude found on the left wing. In 2000, many students applauded Ralph Nader's candidacy and wore
their equal derision for Gore and Bush as a badge of
pride. This year our peers greeted Nader's return with
outrage and protest. We had the protest crowd marching with signs for Howard Dean, a tough-talking moderate with a distinct lack of stars in his eyes. Now we
have them out in force for John Kerry, an eminently
electable talking head. The well-known Web site
j ohnkerr y isadouchebagbutimvotingforhimanyway. com
says it all.
Bland and unappealing as Kerry is, people are voting for him because for all his faults, they like his
party better for them than the other guy's. More and
more college idealists are having that epiphany that
conventional wisdom says we're supposed to get when
we turn 30, that ends sometimes outweigh means, that
what actually happens to you and your kids means
more than absolute consistency with some abstract
moral system.
Students once felt that they should not accept moral
responsibility for a world tarnished with corruptions
and abuse of the system by our elders. Now they seek to
make it better, even if only slightly better, on their elders' terms and using their elders' tools if they have to.
Students begin to see votes and donations as tools that
can make real change rather than standing for symbolic
change; they vote their political strategy rather than
their ideals.
Perhaps we've lost a kind of innocence this way,
opened a door in the ivory tower that can't be closed
again. But perhaps we may gain something in exchange
power, influence and respect, and the wisdom to use it
for the greater good. The '6os taught us that all our good
intentions couldn't, in the end, help us make change outside the system. The 'oos may teach us how to make
change inside it, with our good intentions intact.

Steamed 'n Stewin'

age

Swattie.

We've

all

encountered those uppity
first-years who can't seem
to help trying to prove their
superior intelligence and

maturity in and out of the
classroom. For some the arrogance is genetic, but most just
need to be reminded that a long drive and an unpacked
dorm room do not an independent adult make. Such blase
pooh-poohing of a trip down the slip 'n slide or the novelty
of a mechanical bull is just one shining example of why this
type of orientation is needed.
However, despite the muddy bull riding, this year's
Orientation Committee's philosophy of "less is more" did
not adequately meet this need. Not only were there not
enough activities, there was not one even resembling an
open mic or anything at which students could perform and
show off their own talents. Options like this are absolutely
necessary to counterbalance that welcome "childishness"
we force upon them with some individual agency and a taste
of a defining aspect of thriving college life.
Orientation is a time in which the freshman class
should have some good, clean fun, and be forced to bond as
a class in the process. This past week I have noticed three
specific hindrances to that process that will do nothing but
ensure the continuation of the unfortunate social stratification of this student body. First, we have the fraternity

THE PHOENIX

Orientation is the one
chance we have to denature
some of the deathly seriousness inherent in the aver-

entation Down Under party. Considering DU's indirect

control of the OC for the past two years, this should be a
revelation to no one. Second, the college's prioritization of
athletic success over the welfare of its athletes forces
every fall freshman athlete to enter the college cold. They

are forced to miss nearly every single orientation event,
which really do serve as formative moments in our college
lives, for practices. Third is the orientationdesensitization
visible in every freshman that attended Tri-Co before the
arriving at Swarthmore. They've just spent a week doing
workshops and bonding and they've even done a trust
walk, so spending time with their friends becomes an
understandably higher priority than making even more
new ones in such a tired atmosphere. A degree of social
isolation is a natural part of our culture, but when it is
forced upon us by external, official college forces, as it is in
the above three instances, I find it extremely troubling.
I believe the most detrimental aspect of orientation,
which has been around at least as long as I have, is the serious lack of enthusiasm and dedication from CA's. CA attendance at group events has gotten to the point where it is not
the rule but the exception, and having both your CA's at any
event is almost unheard of. I know from experience that if
CA's put just a modicum of energy into their jobs, and at
least feign interest and (God forbid!) enthusiasm in every
activity, most freshmen would respond in kind and come to
almost every event appearing actually happy to be there. It's
really that simple.

Thus far, I have treated the freshmen class as blameless
victims in all this, but you guys (generic, 21st-century
Swarthmore freshman class) really do kind of suck. Even if
the activities really are "lame," that is no reason not to go.
Nothing brings a group together like shared negative experience. Without the shared negative experience of taxation
without representation we would have no United States, and
without the trust walk we will have no Swarthmore Class of
2009. You need to get over yourselves because orientation
really is what you make of it, and it is ultimately your own
stubborn cynicism holding you back.

Alex Haley's "Roots" is the
great American novel.
What is the novel if it is not

a prose narrative which portrays the psychology of a people? "Gray's Anatomy" shows the
human body. The novel, as a work of drama, shows the human
soul. Every page of "Gray's Anatomy" applies to every human
being who has ever lived. But unlike the body, the soul cannot
be comprehended by a single man. Friedrich Nietzsche would
have apparently disagreed, having once said that "Dostoevsky
is the only psychologist from whom I have anything to learn."
A bit of an overstatement, yet I echo him thus: Haley is the
psychologist from whom we Americans have the most to learn.
He who sees the soul as superstition, free will as nonsense,
human beings as sophisticated Pavlov's dogs, will no doubt
scorn this or any other discussion which dares to take the etymology of psychology, "the science of the soul," seriously. He
will dismiss the fundamental analogy of this essay that psychology is to the soul what anatomy is to the body. His analogy? Psychology is to the human being what biology is to the lab
rat or guinea pig. He sees psychology as a natural science
based on experiment. But to those of us who believe in freedom
and dignity, psychology is an inquiry based on experience.
Every classic drama is a psychological case study.
Although Dostoevsky's "Brothers Karamazov" is specific to
Russia and Haley's "Roots" is specific to Africa and America,
both are general to all humanity. Both were authored by
visionaries who saw order where "realistic" observers see a
"bloomin'buzzin' confusion."
The psychologist is a generalist, broad and circumspect.

He is neither a myopic specialist contriving experiments, nor
a petty observer of people in laboratories. Nor does he ever
dogmatize the human condition. Dostoevsky and Haley, both
grand inquisitors of the human condition, share in that defining characteristic of the psychologist: negative capability.

Using Shakespeare as his archetype, John Keats coined
"negative capability," defining it as "when man is capable of
remaining in uncertainty, mystery, doubt, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason." He hero-worshipped
Shakespeare and Nietzsche hero-worshipped Dostoevsky, for
they admired the scientist who would fearlessly and ruthlessly inquire after that mystery of mysteries, the human soul.
The true psychologist enjoys uncertainty. He flourishes
amidst doubt. He comprehends life as a question. He doesn't

judge people. He analyzes them. I hero-worship Haley, for if
Shakespeare's plays are an encyclopedia of the psychology of
power as it tends to corrupt, if Dostoevsky's novels are an
encyclopedia of psychology from the perspective of the eternal peasant who suffers, then stoops to conquer "Western civilization;" then Haley's sagas are an encyclopedia of psychology from the perspective of exiles maintaining their human
dignity amongst a strange people struggling to dehumanize
them into slaves, then Jim Crow them into "free slaves," all
the while claiming to "civilize" them.
Haley focuses on slavery, the touchstone of American psychology, but he describes it not as that which whites did to
blacks, but as the backdrop to the black American struggle for
existence. "Roots" is only peripherally about how slavery and
its legacy reveal white American hypocrisy and guilt. It is
centrally about how the storm and stress of slavery built
black American character. It is a tour de force of genealogy, to
be sure. Haley spent twelve years researching his family tree,
tracing it back to an African named Kunta Kinte, he who
refused the slave name "Toby" even as his master tried to lash
it into his identity. But first and foremost, "Roots" contributes

to world literature as its deepest exploration of the psychological conflict between master and slave. "Roots" is subtitled
"The Saga of an American Family." It is the saga of an
American people. Unlike the other great Afro-American novels, which are, without exception, romances of the victim,
"Roots" is the Afro-American triumph of the will.

Getting out the 2004 Swat vote
For all Americans,
the 2004 election may

prove to be the most
important presidential

election of their lifetimes. For young people,
this election is a political wake-up call. It's the

first time that many of

us are old enough to vote
for president. We were

power to swing important statewide and local elections.
Four-term Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter faces a
serious challenge
from three-term Democratic
Representative Joseph M. Hoeffel. The Democratic
Party has identified our state's senatorial race as one of
the key contests in the parties' national fight to control
the Senate. So unless you hail from Florida or Ohio or a
handful of other high-level swing states with hot local

races, register to vote here.
In a state where Bush and Kerry are neck-and-neck,

political consciousness has been awakened. As young
people, we care deeply about the war, affirmative action,
the environment and the rising cost of college tuition
all issues that have been brought to the forefront by the
Bush administration. As Swarthmore students, our
votes matter more than most
we are fortunate enough
to go to school in Pennsylvania, one of the most important swing states in the nation.
Growing up in conservative Southern California,
my vote never seemed to matter much. My representative, David Dreier, was a rabid right-winger who had
served in Congress for 20 years and seemed sure to
serve 20 more whether or not he had my vote. My
California senators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne
Feinstein, were two liberal champions. California was
solidly in the blue, and while I was happy to give Boxer
and Feinstein my vote, I knew they could do without it.
Then I moved to Swarthmore, Pennsylvania.
In 2000, Gore carried the state of Pennsylvania by
only five percent. In all of presidential history, a
Democrat has never won the White House without car-

rying our state. What's more, we live in a crucial
Pennsylvania county. A Democrat has never carried the
state without carrying Delaware County.
Not only do our votes have the power to determine
whether Bush remains in office, they also have the

Pennsylvania this fall. Young people could easily be the
deciding factor. In the news, we hear a lot of talk about
swing voters
those soccer moms and NASCAR dads

who never actually seem to materialize. Swing voters
may not have made up their minds whom to vote for,
but by and large, young people aren't confused about
whatBush is doing to our country. According to a poll
taken last spring at Swarthmore, 88 percent of Swatties
either disapprove or strongly disapprove of the way
George W. Bush is handling his job as president.
If young people know what's up, then what's the
problem? They don't vote. The electoral participation of

Americans are incensed. Analysts predict that the 2004
election might be the first since 1992 in which over 50
percent of 18-to-24-year-olds will make it to the polls. But
they won't get there on their own. It will take intensive
voter registration, voter education and voter mobilization efforts the kind that are already in full swing on
our campus. If ever there was a time to get involved
with political organizing at Swat, it's now. And don't
underestimate the significance of simply ensuring that
your hallmates register and vote on Election Day. After
the Florida fiasco in 2000, we should no longer be fooled
into believing that one vote doesn't make a difference.
Our votes are precious and are made even more so

Chambers appointed as Assistant Athletic Director
BY EMILY CONLON
econlonl@swarthmore.edu
This summer the Swarthmore Athletics Department
added a fresh face to administration with the appointment
of Assistant Athletic Director, Christyn Chambers. In her
new position, Chambers will over see the club sports program, Student Athletic Advisory Committee as well as the
management of the athletic facilities.
Growing up in Cincinnati, Chambers became involved in
numerous sports at a young age. Her talent and experience
in soccer led her to Washington University in St. Louis
where she made an immediate impact on the team. A fouryear letter winner and 2001 graduate for the Bears,
Chambers earned all-region honors 1997, 1998, 2000; allAmerican honors in 1998 and the team MVP award for three
consecutive years starting in 1998. But above her accolades,
Chambers notes the bonds with her teammates as the most
rewarding part of her collegiate sports experience.
"I enjoyed playing very much because of the cama-

raderie, friendships, competition, exercise, and simple love
of the game," she said. "We were a very successful team and
I was personally successful, and feel definitely grateful to be
a part of that success."
Uncertain about her future career, the anthropology
major decided to pursue a Masters in Exercise and Sports
Sciences. "I knew that once my soccer career was over at
Wash. U., I wanted my soccer career over, so I needed a
plan," Chambers said. "I had worked within the Wash. U.
athletics department, knew the Assistant AD and the AD
very well and loved what they did. Wanting to stay involved
with college athletics, not wanting to coach, and wanting to
be in the decision-making process all were reasons that
pushed me in the direction of college athletics administra-

tion."

At the UNC-Chapel Hill program, Chambers focused on
the administrative aspects of college athletics. Finding that

(

she liked the work, set her eyes on the position of college or
university athletic director.
Swarthmore Athletic Direction Adam Hertz and members of the athletic department began a nation-wide search
for an assistant AD last spring. "There were nearly 250
applicants in the pool," he said. "A five-person search committee reviewed resumes, deliberated qualifications and
narrowed the pool of candidates. Eventually, four were
brought to campus for interviews."
Hertz added, "We liked the fact that she did her undergraduate work at an institution with high academic regard.
Christyn's experience there as a student athlete, as well as a
worker in the athletic department, we thought, prepared her
well for the position here. Christyn was a unanimous
choice."
Chambers, who had found out about the Swarthmore
position through a third party in contact with Hertz, was
looking to work at a school with a strong commitment to its
student-athletes.
"I wanted to be an athletics director, preferably at an
institution that holds academics with as high if not higher
regards than athletics," she said. "That was the culture from
which I had come and I loved every moment of it."
Swarthmore offered an athletic-academic balance that
appealed to Chambers. "The commitment the student-athletes must have both on and off the field [and] court is
incredible," she said. "Swarthmore has that academic component and is heading down the path to the athletics component. I want to be here to continue the push in that
direction."
In addition to overseeing the club sports program and
SAAC, Chambers hopes to further work on Swarthmore
facilities rental policy. "In order to maintain the fields and
courts for our varsity sports, club sports, IM sports, recreational use, when we grant other outside organizations and
groups use of our facilities, we must stay mindful of the cost
of maintenance."

Chambers joins the athletic department to oversee club
sports and facilties usage.
Ultimately, Chambers' love of sports and experience in
athletic administration will bring positive and beneficial
changes to the department. But although her upcoming
tasks maybe large, Chambers does not forget the athletes
whom she will be supporting. "IfI can serve as an example
of what can be achieved within sport and through sport, thai
is a reward."

When fans attack
There I was, sitting at my computer, wondering why nothing out of the ordinary ever happens in sports anymore, when
I realized that some nut job in Athens had just ran onto the
marathon course and, in some sort of religious protest, tackled
the leader, Vanderlei de Lima, essentially costing him the gold
medal.
You would think that it was the first time this sort of thing
had happened, but unfortunetly this was not Cornelius Horan's
first time interrupting a race.
Last time, he ran onto the
course of the British Grand
Prix. To Horan's credit, his

decision-making skills have
improved a bit, but the fact that
the consequences were not a bit
more severe makes me wonder.

Why are people allowed to
rampage at sporting events
without repercussions? The
obvious example is European
soccer, where the fans are
lucky to escape alive and the
players often dodge glass bottles and toilet paper rolls. Yet,
no changes have been made. In
Horan's case, he was given a
one-year suspension, a small
fine and then warned not to do

Women's rugby returned early this year to prepare for its first divisional match-up against UPenn on Sept. 25

Women's rugby readies for fall
BY DARCY NELSON

dnelsonl@swarthmore.edu

The women's rugby team is
looking forward to a season filled
with match-ups against some
tough Division II and 111 teams.
Although study abroad programs
and injuries have claimed three
members, a number of key players
will be back and ready to face the
competition this season.

Kelly O'Neil 'O5 and Eliza Cava
'O6 return to the team to bolster
the forward pack, both playing the
position of hooker. Soo Lee 'O5 will

new training techniques and our
increased focus on speed and tackle work, I feel that we are more
than up to the challenge," Toro
said, explaining the team's preparation against tougher teams in
the conference.
In preparation for the competition that the ruggers will face, the
team organized preseason training sessions during the third week
of August. The team coordinated
housing and meals with the athletic department and administration
to allow the players to return to

'O5, Lee Paczulla 'O5, Katie
Schlessinger 'O5, Liz Bada 'O7 and
Sally Hall 'O6.
Captain Olivia Toro 'O5 is very
excited about this team. "Our
major goal for this season is to
play good, clean rugby
to make
smart passes, increase the effectiveness of our tackles and rucks,
and work as a team. We want to
avoid earning small penalties on
the field," she said. Toro believes
that the team will live up to expec-

campus early.
Women's rugby is a SBC-chartered group on campus, although
many of their expenses have to
come from their own budget. The
team finds ways to meet the necessary costs, such as the per-meal
cost at Sharpies during preseason.
"We have fund-raising events
to supplement the money we are
given from SBC," Lizzie Buckner
'O6 said. "The team really got its
act together to plan for preseason."
Despite being a club sport,
women's rugby has found ways to
get in as much practice time as
possible before the start of the sea-

"From what I've observed during preseason, I have no doubt
that we are going to achieve those
standards," she said. "With our

.
In addition to competition from
other schools, the team will also
have to face the task of reorganizing their own line-up, in particular the back line.
"It will be crucial for us to
recruit freshmen and sophomore
women, as more than 75 percent of

our team are currently juniors
seniors,"

Toro
said.
Nevertheless, Toro keeps perspective on the season and the team.
An "important goal for this sea-

son, and indeed, for subsequent
seasons, is to maintain the fun,
spirit, and sense of camaraderie
that makes our team so successful," she said.

The team's first divisional
match-up will be against the
University of Penn. on Saturday,
Sept. 25. The team hopes to participate in the annual Beantown
Rugby Tournament during the
weekend of Sept. 18. The women
will also face Bucknell University

and green-clad supporters stormed the field, stopping play for
nearly 10 minutes. For most sports, like soccer, with a confined
area of play, it seems relatively easy to separate player from
fan. Yet, even there, it is not being done. Mark Roberts, the selfproclaimed greatest streaker in the world, has made a living
out of managing not only to get around security and onto the
field during some of the biggest events of each year, but doing
so with his junk hanging out.
If we can't keep a middle-aged, naked man from jumping out
of a crowd at the Super Bowl, it's not looking good for those
hoping to police a 26-mile course. Though, from what I saw,
only about six people attended this year's Olympics (and I
doubt all of them made it out to the marathon), so maybe that

was not such an unrealistic goal for the organizers. Regardless,
I wonder why authorities weren't more suspicious when they
saw a crazed man in a green kilt approaching the course.
Things get far more complicated when fans actually decide
to attend events. This summer, I watched Lance Armstrong
climb the mountainous roads of l'Alpe d'Huez, though I don't
recall actually seeing the road at any point. Armstrong peddled
into a sea of spectators, each of whom seemed to jump out of the
way at the last possible second. Somehow, he avoided any accidents this year, but just one year ago, his handlebar got caught
in an onlooker's bag, which sent him crashing to the asphalt.
Fortunately, in the great tradition of sportsmanship in the Tour
de France, the other riders waited for Lance to get back on his
bike before they continued racing.
De Lima was not so lucky. He lost 13 seconds of his 45-second
lead during the actual incident, and as he struggled to settle back
into his rhythm, two more runners passed him in the final three
miles. I've never run a marathon before, but I'd think after running at such a clip for almost two hours, your body starts to get
a bit tired. I doubt anything in his training could have prepared
him for what he was to face 22 miles into the race.
How close do these so-called fans need to be? It would be a
shame to have to barricade every inch of these amazing events,
and even then, it might not stop the most determined of meddlers. Still, if it'd keep a few more guys like de Lima from losing his shot at something to which they've dedicated themselves for months, maybe it's worth it. If I can watch hockey
from behind a net to save the lives of a few more kids, I can definitely handle keeping a safe distance from these athletes to
ensure no one interferes with their events.
Sadly, de Lima's petition for a duplicate gold was turned
down, although he does have a bronze medal to wear back to
Brazil for his efforts. Meanwhile, Horan will return to Ireland
with little more than a lighter wallet. Then again, a man with
so little regard for his own life that he stood in the way of cars
racing at over 200 miles per hour cannot really be expected to
care about the four years some man has dedicated to a dream.

The women's cross country team is also trying to build
on last year's success. The theme for the fourteen-runner
team is "small but mighty." Last season featured two allconference runners and a fourth place finish at the conference meet. Elizabeth Gardner 'O5 captains the squad this

Emily Wistar 'O6 and Molly Maurer 'O6 are strong all-conference candidates. Coach Carroll is optimistic about his
mighty runners, training to crack the top three in conference and the top ten at Nationals. He hopes that the two
