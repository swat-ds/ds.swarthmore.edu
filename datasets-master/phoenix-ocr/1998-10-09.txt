Borough to

Town task force discusses
new building options
by Lance Langdon
Staff Writer
The future of downtown

Swarthmore was the topic at hand

at the first meeting ofSwarthmore
Borough's Town Center Task
Force on Tuesday, October 6.
Among the projects proposed by
committee members were a
downtown inn, a pub, a small cinemathat would snow art films, the
opening of defunct retail space for
a coffee house, and the introduction of street cart vendors.
Composed of 14residents of
Swarthmore and one college affiliate, 'Vice President of College
and Community Relations
Maurice Eldridge, the Task Force
is in the early stages of a town
planning process that will stretch
into the spring, when it will
present a draft of recommendations to the Swarthmore Borough
Council.
For the committee members,
the desire to adjust to changing
markets is tempered by concern
for preserving the comfort of a
small town center. "This is a place
where people know you on the
street," one committee member
stated. "A lot ofplaces in America
are trying to get back to the small
town by reviving a main street.
We still have that. We still have a
small town. Because of that, we
have something to teach
America."
Foremost among the traits of
the town that members wished to
preserve was its pedestrian orientation. Members were also concerned that core businesses and
services of the town, such as
Michael's and the Co-op, be
maintained, and that any changes

implemented by the committee
would not make the town unsafe
for either children or the elderly.
The committee expressed
concern that the business district
is not capitalizing on the college
market, specifically mentioning
that store hours are not coordinated with times students might
want to get off campus to "decompress." Other issues of concern were the danger of crossing
Chester Road, the dangerous disrepair of the town's broken sidewalks, the lack of an arrival point
or "front door" to the business
district, and the lack of a "critical
mass" ofretailers to make the borough a shopping destination.
Development ideas included
the abovementioned restaurant
and coffee house, as well as plans
for renovating the alleys, brightening up storefronts, attracting
more diverse eating options. Also
noted was the possibility of moving the college bookstore into the
Ville. Members of the committee
are planning a trip to nearby
Doylestown and Narbeth, as well
as possibly Haddenfield and Bryn
Mawr, to "see other places that
have some characteristics" that
the Swarthmore residents might
find appropriate for Swarthmore
itself.
The Task Force is still seeking ways to coordinate its efforts
with the students, faculty, and
staff of the College, although
there is talk of holding focus
groups and inviting students to email in suggestions in the upcoming months. The committee plans
to meet the first Tuesday of each
month. Comments about the process can be directed to Maurice
Eldridge.

swear in new

police chief
by Nate Ashby-Kuhlman
Staff Writer
During fall break the Swarthmore Borough will swear in a
new police chief who said he is
open to addressing concerns of
the college. Brian Craig, now a
captain in the Philadelphia Police Department, will begin
work Wednesday if his nomination is approved as expected.
Craig's appointment comes
during a semester which has featured an increased borough police presence on campus and a
resulting backlash of student
anti-police sentiment.
"I certainly look forward to
establishing a working relationship both with the college administration and the Public
Safety Department," Craig said
in a telephone interview this
week.

The face of "the notorious would-be Dictator and selfproclaimed deity Nevin Katz" hanging outside of Parrish.
photo by Kristen Panfilio

Nevin Katz '00 threatens
Swarthmore way of life
To the Editor:

I have never written a letter like this before, but never
before have circumstances urged me into such an impassioned response. I am writing to protest the recent plastering of Communist propaganda around this campus and to
urge my fellow students to join me in confronting the
totalitarian menace known in these parts as "Katzism."
"What Communist propaganda?" you may ask. Well,
the fact that you do not realize its existence is part of the
problem. I refer to the menacing Red banner that scars the
pristine wall of Parrish, our oldest and most sacred building. Not only does this Red banner suggest the revival of
a form of government that I thought had been eradicated
long ago, but its portrayal of one ever-watching face is
reminiscent of the "Big Brother" of Orwell's "1984."
Not to mention this face belongs to none other than the
notorious would-be Dictator and self-proclaimed deity
"Nevin Katz."
Despite the fearsome aspects of this propaganda,
perhaps you are wondering what, if anything, could come
of this? I will tell you. Katzism has already attracted a
large following of Swarthmore students, not to mention
"Fords" and "Martyrs" who seek to overrun our campus.
These students meet regularly to worship and pay tribute
to this one man and they seek to take over our campus,
starting with Parrish, the vital nerve center of our precious
way of life.
For those of you who understand my concerns, and I
am sure that it will be very few of you, for Katzism has
already infiltrated the very pores of our thought in
undescribable ways, I urge you to band together in protest
of this vile form of totalitarian propaganda. We must
remember that democracy and capitalism are the greatest
social systems to grace humanity, and that there are others
like you who will stop at nothing to see the virtues of the
free market and entrepreneurial enterprise bless all the
people of this earth.

United States
should
reexamine
foreign policy
by Wendy Lawrence
Contributing Writer

I remember watching the buildup
presidential elections
while studying abroad in Merida, Venezuela. Curled up on the double bed at
home with my host mother and two sisters, we watched fairly bad Venezuelan
soap operas on Venevision. Every so
often, the commercial breaks would
give updates of the status of the various Colombian presidential candidates.
Colombia seemed so close, the elections so pertinent, and the issues so
important.
Now, months later and back in the
States, the information seems almost
irrelevant. Who in the US really cares
what's going on in Colombia? An article in this week's Economist suggests
that maybe we should care.
President Pastrana might not be
unique in his promises of peace in an
unstable nation, but the recent months
have proven that his promises were not
empty ones. Only hours after being
elected, Pastrana began pressingagainst the wishes of others in the government-to visit unsafe guerrilla territory in Colombia. Now he is attempting to demilitarize a large part of southem Colombia in order to pave the way
for talks with the guerrilla forces there.
It doesn't seem like anything can stop
him.
Unless, of course, "anything" is
defined as the omnipotent USA. Promoting peace in Colombia is not high
up on our government's list of desirable things.
The need to demilitarize parts of
Colombia appears to be preventing
United States action on the behalf of
Pastrana, as demilitarization would
lead to problems with aerial patrols of
coca. These aerial patrols, already controversial, are performed primarily at
the insistence of and with money from
the US.
No one should be surprised that the
US is acting based on its own interests.
Instances like this are no less common
than Mo, the bully, stealing lunch
money from Calvin. But every time one
reads of the newest big stick wielding
of the US, it should prompt one to step
back and think.
I am not certain that the our ability
to boss around the little guys should
be taken for granted. Even if it is futile to suggest that Mo let Calvin simply buy his lunch, it's still good to ask
to the Colombian

"why?"
Right now is an excellent time to
ask "why," to question our right to play
the bully, to challenge the assumption
that "can" implies "ought." The world
is shrinking and countries are becoming closer together. But while the borders between nations appear fainter in
some ways, they appear as black and
bold as ever in others.
It is true that Colombian policy has
an effect on the US especially regarding the drug trade. But does this give
justification for intervention? I don't
believe it does. One nation's intervention into the affairs of another will
never be for the good of both, especially when a stronger nation applies
force to a weaker one.
Increased interdependence should
result in increased cooperation, not increased exploitation. The current economic situation hints that nations
should be able to look out for each
other, as the failure of one could easily
lead to the fall of another. But the idea
of nations looking out for each other
does not mean the US is stuck with
looking out for the little guys. It means
having nations take a more active role
7- not in terms of policy making, but
in terms of policy suggestions in the
governing of others.
Do we even want to keep up this
role? Power is all well and good, but it
makes sense that the interests of the
world, rather than the nation, should be
considered. Even if the US were to
adopt a more cooperative foreign
policy agenda, our ability to bargain
and negotiate would remain high.
Foreign policy that incorporates
more nations is better than policy in
which one nation plays the bully role.
"Because I said so" is not a good reason to force Colombia to carry out
aerial raids on coca plantations, nor is
it a good reason to prevent demilitarization of part of their country in order
to plan peace talks.
It is irrational to suggest that the
US not get involved, but maybe it is
rational to suggest that the direct role
that the US plays in the policy of other
nations should be reevaluated, that its
"big stick" policies be replaced with a
smaller, gentler stick.

Swat students start AIDS Walk team
by Latika Young
Contributing Writer
Although advertised as "the $7OOO
party," last Friday night's AIDS Walk
Benefit at the Women's Resource Center was not quite so successful, managing instead to raise only $547.
Fundraising, however, was not the only
emphasis of this benefit jointly sponsored by HOLA, SQU, QSA, and DC.
According to AIDS Walk coordinator Karina Kacala 'O2, the party
placed a "double emphasis on
fundraising and also getting the word
out to the student body. We wanted to
inform students and help the walk, but
at the same time have fun."
Red was the theme of the night as
everyone who donated received a red
ribbon, drank Shirley Temples and cranberry spritzers and listened to the music
of Elizabeth Nickrenz, The Awful Din,
Jennifer Tyson and Will Quale, Alisa
Greenberg and DJ Dave Auerbach. The
upper room of the WRC felt a little
smaller than usual as people had to
squeeze together to accomodate the constant flow of new arrivals.
All of the money raised during
Friday's party will be used to sponsor
Swarthmore's first team in this year's
Philadelphia AIDS Walk, which takes
place October 18 from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
So far, twenty-four Swarthmore students
have registered to walk in this event,
which starts at the Philadelphia Museum
ofArt and travels for eight miles along
the Schuylkill River. The day's activities also include pre-walk speeches, live
bands and food along the route and a
free concert and picnic after the walk.
Money raised from the thousands of
people who participate each year is given
directly to over 50 community service
organizations in the Philadelphia area,
including the Albert Einstein Medical
Center, ActionAlDS and MANNA.
Since the walk began in 1987,6.5 million dollars have been donated to these
various organizations.
Kacala, who has participated in the
walk since her sophomore year of high
school, decided to organize a team from
Swarthmore after noticing that both

My first day in Chiang Mai, Thailand, was certainly a shock to the system. Jettisoning my plans to visit Cambodia and Vietnam, I decided to head to
Chiang Mai to decide if this was really a
place I wanted to be for five months. I
ignored the warnings of"Lonely Planet"
and took a tourist "VIP special" from
Kao San Road heading north.
Predictably, the bus broke down. In
fact, it broke down three times, and each
time I had just barely closed my eyesand
willed myself to sleep, simply wanting
to wake up in the morning and find myself in Chiang Mai. Sometime around 8
a.m. the bus rolled into a gas station in
the middle of nowhere. In broken English our driver announced that this was
the end of the ride. Confused and slightly
perturbed, strangers bonded over stories
of broken-down buses and having to
hitchhike in far-off countries like Laos.
As we got off the bus, we were
greeted by signs with lists of names on
them. I grabbed my backpack, and figuring that "Robin Hode" was supposed
to be me, I joined one of the groups. After there were enough people around her,
the ka-toey (Thai for transvestite or transsexual) holding the sign finally spoke up.
"Hello, my name is Julie. I take you to
my guest house in Chiang Mai, I give
you free night accomodation. No
bullshit," she said.
One ofthe Americans finally got sick
of the situation, attempting a "Look,

but he was quickly
cut off by Julie. "Look, mister, I'm just a
working girl.You have problem, you ask
the owner of the bus," she said. Of course
the bus had driven off by now.
After twelve hours on a bus, not
many of us were in the mood for argument. Anyway, Julie had also offered us
a free coffee, and that would have sold
any one of us right then. After about 20
minutes we arrived at the guesthouse. We
were all pleasantly surprised to find that
not only did it have walls and a roof, but
it was also clean and quite pleasant.

Making machinery sound soulful
isn't easy, and it is usually too much
for most artists who rely heavily upon
it. However, just because a musician
uses technology, doesn't mean that he
(and they are almost always he's) is
some wonky ex-CS major with a musical bent. DJ Shadow is one half of
UNKLE, along with MoWax label
founder James Lavelle, and he's a perfect example of how good, and how
soulful, technology can sound on
record. His 1995 full-length debut,
Endtroducing, basically created and
defined a genre of its own and is one
of the most unique releases of the UNKLE
19905.
Psyence Fiction
Pre-Emptive Strike, released in the MoWax/London
spring, compiled some early Shadow
material and recent MoWax 12" releases, and was a disappointment when compared to Endtroducing. Strike sorely lacks continuity, and the early material
(particularly the four part "What Does Your Soul Look Like" suite) showcases
the sluggish and vaguely pretentious side of Shadow.
With the exception of the odd 12" release or soundtrack contribution, most
of which were quite good, Shadow has done little new work since Endtroducing.
Last year, word came out that he was working on the UNKLE project with
Lavelle, and as the guest list for UNKLE became more widely known and more
prestigious, the record became one of the most hyped and anticipated of the new
year.
The good news for those of us waiting excitedly for UNKLE is that it is an
exceptionally good record. Unfortunately, it's also not quite all that it could've
been. While Shadow delivers on the sort of hard, richly textured beats that have
become his trademark—Lavelle's role was somewhere between supervisor and
executive producer—there are some problems with the album.
Most ofthese difficulties come from the guests.
When the collaborations work, though, UNKLE hits harder than any record
this year. A revitalized Kool G Rap rips it with his trademark intensity on the
album's opener, "Guns Blazing (Drums of Death Part 1)." This is probably the
best beat G Rap has ever had, and while his mafioso-based lyrics are a little
passe, he's retained every ounce of the roughness that made the early Kool G
Rap and DJ Polo records hip-hop classics.
The other major hip-hop contributor to UNKLE is the Beastie Boys' Mike
D, who rhymes with old school aplomb on the second part of the Drums of
Death cycle, "The Knock."
Unfortunately, perhaps the two best lyricists on the UNKLE record do not
have any verses; Shadow's cohorts on the Solesides record label and on last
year's groundbreaking Latyrx album, Lateef and Lyrics Born, are unfortunately
and inexplicably limited to contributing some background chatter on "Guns
Blazing."
The non-hip-hop contributors to UNKLE vary in degrees of notoriety, and
in the degree to which their songs succeed. Radiohead's Thorn Yorke and a
perfect sample of actor Danny Aiello from the film "Jacob's Ladder" help make
the album-closing "Rabbit In Your Headlights" one of the most atmospheric and
haunting songs in recent memory.
Richard Ashcroft of The Verve also comes off well on the nine-minute odyssey "Lonely Soul," adding to Shadow's brilliantly moody backing beats and
to Wil Malone's strings lyrics that make up in effectiveness for their lack in
depth. Yet it's here that some of the problems with Psyence Fiction begin to
make themselves felt. "Lonely Soul" is astonishing for five minutes or so, and
seems almost certain to become the best thing that anyone from The Verve would
ever be associated with. But the song goes on for nearly four minutes after that,
as Malone's strings spiral downward from perfect, to overwrought, to completely
inexplicable. Malone pops up again, with his composition "Concerto for Strings
and Beats" becoming the basis of "Celestial Annihilation." Even with some
Shadow scratching and additions, the track sounds like a lesser offering from a
Kraftwerk b-sides compilation.
Most ofthe collaborations on Psyence Fiction are successful in one way or
another: "Nursery Rhyme," which features the rock outfit Badly Drawn Boy, is
a nice, speedy change of pace, and Alice Temple's contribution to "Bloodstain"
creates an interesting meditation on love and drug abuse. Something is wrong
with "Chaos," though, which blends Atlantique's breathy Natalie Imbruglia
impersonation and mild guitar picking to create something dangerously akin to
album filler.
UNKLE's two original instrumentals, "UNKLE Main Title Theme" and
"Unreal," are among the best songs on the record, and the collaborations that
work well are ridiculously tight. But though nothing on Psyence Fiction can
really be called out-and-out wack, a weak track or two on an album of only ten
songs can do a lot of damage. More Shadow instrumentals might've helped, and
a little more willingness to restrain some of the collaborators (why would Malone
get two tracks and Latyrx none?) couldn't have hurt either. But in the end neither of these flaws are close to fatal. Even if the UNKLE record doesn't quite
measure up to its potential, it's a solid effort and in some special moments is
very brilliant.

Earlier this year, New York MC
Canibus, with little more than a series
of respected cameos on other artists'
a tribe ca led quest
songs to his credit, took on (and, many
felt, took out) LL Cool J with his song
"2nd Round KO." This lyrical mugging
of LL, an old school icon going lucratively to seed these days, met with little
censure from the masses. Some in the
hip-hop community— from MC's who
responded angrily to Canibus' hubris
to heads who were offended that someone would disrespect someone who
had so much to do with hip-hop becoming the influential art form that it is today—saw this as another example of A Tribe Called Quest
hip-hop going down the toilet.

crease hip-hop's financial profile, but the crucial separation from hip-hop's roots
hasn't narrowed, and problems remain. As of this year, legends were putting out
lackluster records (Rakim's recent 18th Letter is a painful example), mediocre
artists were jetting to the top of the charts, and, increasingly, people were saying
that legends such as A Tribe Called Quest had fallen off. What in the name of
Slick Rick was going on here?

"I felt Swarthmore students would
be very responsive [to forming their own
team]. We could help [the cause] and
benefit [ourselves] through understanding and awareness," said Kacala about
her motivation for initiating a team here.
When asked why she continues to
participate in the walk, Kacala said, "It
is just one ofthose things that is both fun
and moving at the same time. You never

forget about why you are [walking] and
about the people you are helping."
"Next year I hope to start sooner
to get more people involved and collect even more donations," said Kacala.
Members of the AIDS Walk committee, who will be tabling today during lunch and dinner at Sharpies, welcome direct contributions. Those interested in participating in the walk can

Illicit pleasures abound in Thailand
by Rohan Hoole

Music Reviews

Strewn around the dining area were
the bodies of various farang (tourists)
from all over the world. Julie laughed
wickedly, saying "They got back from
my jungle trek yesterday and then play
beer games until 3 a.m.!"
Within five minutes of our arrival,
the spiel began. You never get something
for nothing, and it turned out that the free
night was an opportunity for Julie to sell
one of her jungle treks. Scrap books and
photo albums were handed around.
"Here is the Bob Marley field, you
pass it on the first day!" said Julie. Suddenly the interest of the 10 backpackers
was piqued. In front of us were photographs of a field with gigantic marijuana
plants. "You like gunga? First night we
drink moonshine whiskey, and you can
try Dr O—much better than gunga," she
claimed. A whole photo album was devoted to picures of young backpackers
lying horizontally, taking hits from an
opium pipe in a hill tribe village. According to Julie, the pipes cost only three
baht (seven and a half cents). This was
appealing to most of the group.
The days ofpassing around joints in
public in Thailand are long over. Even
marijuana is highly illegal and will land
you in jail for a few years if you are
caught. Julie's offer of plentiful drugs in
the safety of the jungle was too much to
resist for most, and after fifteen minutes
the sign-up page was full, and Julie's
wallet was fat with deposits.
Most of the day was spent at the
guesthouse. I connected with Chad, a
Californian chef, and another man named
Joe. Around eight we decided to take a
look at the famous Chiang Mai Night
Bazaar and maybe pick up cheap clothes
or a fake watch. As we approached the
road leading to the Night Bazaar, we saw
a strip of bars with bright flashing lights.
As we walked by, the bar girls
hooked their arms around ours, greeting
us with "Welcome, handsome man, come
in and have a drink!" We looked at each
other and laughed, but kept walking. As
we walked past the fourth bar, however,
a voice called out "Hey, Chad!"
Soon we were inside the bar with a

man Chad had met on some southern
beach a few weeks before. Before I knew
it, there were girls all over each of us.
We were asked the standard questions:
"Where are you from?", "What do you
do?" and "How long are you in Chiang
Mai?" These questions are easy to field
in a normal bar, but I was completely unprepared to deal with this situation. My
only contact with prostitution had been
through books, TV, and abstract classroom discussion. My somewhat lame
response was to ignore the girl, give oneword answers and concentrate on talking to Chad's friend Travis, who luckily
was about as interested as I was in taking home a bar girl.
Chad and Joe were a different matter altogether. Joe had moved to another
table and was enjoying the attentions of
the two pretty Thai girls on either side of
him. Chad had his arm around a very
young-looking girl. He was probing her
about her age, trying to break through
the lie that she was twenty. After a bit of
bantering, though, he gave up. "The
younger the better!" he declared loudly.
I turned away in disgust as he then proceeded to give her a long, deep kiss.
A few minutes later, Chad had left
the bar with the girl and Joe had rejoined
us. He explained that the girl he'd been
after had jilted him for a middle-aged
German guy. Besides, he was freaked out
by the whole thing, although he had almost talked himself into taking her home.
By consensus we decided that it was all
a little too much and headed toward the
Night Bazaar. Arriving home that night,
I found that the room I shared with Chad
was an absolute mess. Even the sheets
had been stripped from both of our beds.
I put a blanket down and went to sleep in
disgust. The next day I got my own room.

GLSEN Conference at NYU
disorganized, but productive
A contingent of Swarthmore students

attended the Gay-Lesbian-Straight Education Network (GLSEN) conference Sat-

urday at New York University.
Although the conference did achieve
its goals—to advance education on queer
issues, especially those facing youth of
high school and college age, and to further develop dialogue between bisexual,
gay, lesbian and transgender and queerfriendly people—its leadership and organization were insufficient for its purpose.
Undoubtedly, many people came
away from the conference better acquainted with the resources available to
queer young adults. They may have become better informed on issues concerning sensitivity to those with different
sexual identities, and they may have
gained a better understanding of the particular issues facing each group. These
things come naturally from the gathering
together of two to three hundred students
and teachers ready to address these concerns.
Unfortunately, these discussions were
not facilitated as well as they should have
been. The requisite number of people
with the necessary will to learn were
present, but the proper amount of leadership was not. As a result, though a good
time was had by all, many of the students
from the Swarthmore group left feeling
that more could have been accomplished.
The conference lasted from 11 a.m.
until 8 p.m. Over the course of the day,
attendees went to a keynote speech, three
workshop sessions, a lunch, a dinner and
a performance. The group from Swarthmore drove up to NYU in a school van in
the morning, arriving too late to hear the
keynote speech because of a mix-up on
the New Jersey turnpike. They stayed
until the very end and arrived home just
after midnight.
•. The main portion of the conference
consisted of the three workshop sessions.
In each session, attendees could choose
among nine or ten different workshops.
Some of them were expressly intended for

the ballroom scene. Together, he and
Hans facilitated a very informative discussion of gender issues, though Hans
was often vague about the fine points of
his discussion.
Roberto Monte, the seventeen-yearold facilitator of "Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,
Transgender and Questioning Youth in the
Foster Care System" seemed completely
unprepared for any kind of presentation;
it seems that he was supposed to be joined
by two older, more knowledgeable authorities on the matter. Nonetheless, the
attendees were able to glean much information from Monte's presentation on the
LGBT foster care system.
Monte currently lives in the
Gramercy Residence, a group home dedicated to servicing LGBT youth who have
had trouble in other foster care or group
home situations. Residents receive a room
and possibly a high school education
within the building, and spaces are
heavily contested, with 75 people applying each week. The Gramercy Residence
is one of a very few of its kind, and it
became obvious from the discussion with
Monte that other foster care and group
home environments can be very hostile
to LBGT youth. Perhaps due to
Gramercy, Monte's seems to be a success
story—he will study at Columbia University next year. Those who wish to support Gramercy Residence and its small
high school, the Audre Lorde, can write
to Green Chimneys at 327 East 22nd
Street, New York, NY 10010.
After the workshops, attendees went
to an institutional dinner. Next, they
watched a performance put on by a group
of queer youth, which incorporated video,
acting, testimony and one gay teen's consumption of a whole cake and a bottle of
milk. The performance was not very well
done or even enjoyable, but it was moving at times and did serve to give the audience better understanding of the issues
and problems facing queer teens.

students, some invited a mix of young
adults and educators, and a few others
were exclusively for adults. Themes of
discussion ranged from "Gaybonics —A
Study of the Language Surrounding
Queer Life" and "Queer Representation
Films"
to
Hollywood
in
"Nonstigmatizing Health Care for LGBT
[Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, or Transgender]
Youth."
In general, the more narrowly focused
the subject of discussion, the better the
workshop. The workshop on "Homophobia Within Our Community," for example,
was so broad that a reasonable, concentrated discussion was impossible. There
was certainly much discussion, and many
people in the workshop got the rare opportunity to express their frustrations with
queer life to a compassionate group. In
this sense, the workshop was productive.
But one didn't come out of the workshop
feeling educated on how to deal with or
combat homophobia.
The workshop "Feel the HEAT, Let's
Talk About Gender!" however, was quite
informative, mostly because it was a new
subject to the Swarthmoreans who attended it. The facilitator, T. Aarons Hans,
who has gone through a female-to-male
hormone process, led a discussion of the
meaning of gender and its relation to
people's bodies and identities. He discussed the subtleties of meaning encased
in words like "transgender," "transsexual," "butch/femme," "drag" and
"cross-dressing." He advocated the jettison of the word "sex" from the vocabulary of gender, so that sexual preference
and the sexual act could be entirely removed from gender identity.
In another portion of that workshop,
a leader of the New York ballroom scene,
which caters mostly to New York's drag
and cross-dressing community, introduced the attendees of the workshop to
the ways in which ballroom's system of
"Houses" forms fall-back families for
queer youth. He

•

Here's an idea for starters)

in 1990, as under-achievers.
Through their twin masterpieces, 1991's Low End Theory
and 1993's Midnight Marauders, Tribe carved out a niche in
hip-hop for music that was experimental without being inaccessible, and intelligent without
being preachy. Most importantly, Tribe was fun as hell to
listen to. Q-Tip and Phife interacted beautifully on the mic,
with their different styles and
vocal tones complimenting each
other perfectly. The beats (done
as a unit with the groups third
Shaheed
Ali
member
Muhammad) were able to cominnovation
and
bine
danceability.
Beats, Rhymes and Life,
released in 1996, was a disappointment in Tribe terms, and
the talk that Tribe was no longer
on top of the game really began,
as the staying power of Beats
was revealed to be minimal, and
increased in the relative silence
following its release. During this
interim the group moved away
from each other, both geographically (Phife now lives in
Atlanta, while Q-Tip and Ali
still live in New York) and artistically. A few weeks before the
release of The Love Movement,
Tribe formally announced that
they were breaking up, and that
this would be their final studio
effort. Even though retirement
in music is rarely final, the announcement lends the release of
Love Movement a certain urgency: not only did Tribe have
something to prove with this album, but it is, for better or
worse, their epitaph.
The consensus so far seems
to be that The Love Movement
is a failure. The hip-hop press
is studiously avoiding disrespect, but while it is obvious that
Love Movement is not another
Tribe masterwork, the relative
silence of Tribe fans as regards
this record suggests that it isn't
even another Beats.
Certainly it sounds different. Beats featured some tracks
that left Tribe fans cold (particularly the sappy radio-friendly
unit-shifter "Stressed Out," featuring Mrs. Biggie Smalls, Faith
Evans), but the beats generally
followed the jazzy and inventive
Tribe model. The majority ofthe
music on The Love Movement,
on the other hand, is as stripped
down as a beat can be and still
sound finished. The big, jazzy
breaks of classic Tribe have
given way here to simple tracks
built mostly around percussion.
Overall, the energy level is far,
far lower than usual.
Some of this probably has
to do with the fact that the members of Tribe aren't kids anymore, and perhaps rhyming
about leaving their wallet in El
Segundo no longer seems appealing. The mood here is less
playful than reflective, and the
subject of all this reflection, as
the album's title indicates, is
love. This manifests itself not
only through songs about relationships, such as the pleasant

first single, "Find a Way," and
"Against the World," but also
through anthems of general
spiritual compassion such as
"The Love." The message is appealing, and Tip and Phife are
always entertaining and usually
incisive, but most of the album
wanders, good-naturedly but not
especially excitingly, through its
somewhat uninspired course.
There are exceptions to this:
as per the Tribe model, the album opener, "Start It Up," is
lively as hell. Though it announces the new sound of the
record (big drums, simple synth,
stop-and-go rhyming), "Start It
Up" suggests that this particular change isn't all bad. And
sometimes the simple formula
works beautifully: for all their
divergence from tradition, songs
like "Da Booty" and "Busta's
Lament" make the simplicity
sound great. Also, when Tribe
is joined by guests on Love
Movement's two posse cuts (a
Tribe forte in the past, as Low
End Theory's "Scenario" demonstrates) the sluggishness vanishes. "Steppin' It Up," which
pairs Tip and Phife with frequent collaborator Busta
Rhymes (sounding better than
he has in a long while) and Jersey genius Redman, is classic
Tribe energy. The album's final
song, "Rock Rock Y'all," with
rising underground stars Jane
Doe, Punchline and Wordsworth
and the mighty Mos Def, feels
like old times, too.
When Love Movement isn't
working, though, as in the pleasant but uninspired "Like It Like
That," or in the likable, if puzzling, collaboration with
Noreaga, Queens' Crown Prince
of Ignorant Rhymes, it's depressing. It's depressing not because it's wack (it's important
to emphasize that this isn't a bad
record by any stretch), but because it is A Tribe Called Quest,
but at the same time it isn't. The
Love Movement is pleasant,
smart, and in its way, musically
innovative, but, for the most
part, feels like one big fade-out.
As a Tribe fan, I enjoy this
record; if you like hip-hop at all,
you'll probably enjoy it, too. But
the blazing brilliance of Low
End Theory and Midnight Marauders is gone. It is absent from
this record, and, as A Tribe
Called Quest follows this solid
if disposable record into hip-hop
history, that distinctive brilliance also disappears from the
hip-hop scene. The six extra
songs (they're hard-to-find remixes and soundtrack cuts from
the golden years of '9l-93) included at the end of a limited
edition release of the album are
a fitting coda to this record.
It is hard, maybe impossible, for me to explain the intangible something that made
Tribe what they were. Better to
leave it to one of the bonus
tracks, for example the classic
"Scenario" remix, to do what
my words cannot: demonstrate
what Tribe was when they were
the most interesting group in
hip-hop, and what they are not
on The Love Movement.

Bucknell edges out Injuries plague women's

women ruggers
Rhiana Swartz
and Danielle Thomas
by

EoAtributing Writers

The Swat Women's Rugby
Team travelled far and away to
Bucknell this Saturday, looking for their first divisional
win. Unfortunately, the "Big
W" was still hiding as Swat
pulled out of cow country.
Despite a much improved attitude and level of play, Swat
was edged out by their opponents by one
converted try.
Despite the
fact that many
players had to
play again,
Swat's B-side
avenged Aside's 0-7 loss
and won in
commanding
style 17-0.
Swat dominated the Aside game, maintaining possession of the ball for the majority of it. The only try of the
game was scored when
Bucknell got lucky off of a
questionable scrum five
meters from the try zone. The
try was converted and Swat
came back on the attack. The
Swat pack led by captain Sarah "tossle top" Cross '99
dominated rucks and mauls,
winning the ball decisively,
despite the ref's effort to the
contrary. Maya Peterson 'O2
played an excellent first Aside game at flanker along
with veteran Nancy Craig 'Ol.
This combo of speed and
strength left Bucknell begging
for mercy.
The backs played a much
improved game as well. Beth
Vose '99 led the line nailing

crucial tackles and playing the
aggressive game she's famous
for. Cathy Vaughan 'Ol, in her
return to the A-side pitch,
played well at fullback, kicking well in crucial situations.
The B-side game was one
of revenge and pure domination. The vast majority of the

Millersville roughs
up men's rugby
by Dan Green

Contributing Writer
Last Saturday the plucky
Buzzards faced Millersville
amid the cornfields of Middle
America. Despite showing determination and discipline,
Swat's under-Buzzard-ed squad
was no match for Millersville's
numerous and sizeable thugs.
Millersville struck early,
bursting downhill (yes, downhill) through multiple tackles to
touch down the ball and take a
7-0 lead. The opponents showed
off excellent teamwork and
toughness in ramming through
defense.
Swarthmore's
Millersville was able to dominate the ball and scored two
more tries before the half.
The Buzzards held firm,
however, and delivered devastating hits, led by a mobile forward pack and Mike "Moose"
Sheer 99, who drew the ire of
Millersville's horde of fans by
delivering ferocious hits and
plugging every hole in the back
defense. The first half was 40
minutes of the most brutal
rugby this writer can remember,
and despite their lack of size the
Buzzards put on a good show.
Only 15 suited up for the
Buzzards, and the squad's total
lack of substitutes played a critical role in the defeat. Near the
v

end of the half Sutharsen
Ganesan 'OO injured his neck
a
three-man
stopping
Millersville freight train. The
Buzzards entered the second
half a man down, and were walloped by fresh Millersville bodies, despite Tony Sturm '99's
numerous textbook tackles.
One bright spot for the Buzzards was the stellar play of several rookies playing A-side for
the first time. Gerry Kaufman
'99 picked up some skills in a
hurry,
and
embarassed
Millersville's scrumhalf on a
weak-side play. Jeff Wu 'Ol
stood up to both Millersville's
ill-mannered wing and the
abuse of the fans to consistently
dampen Millersville's wide attack. Joon Choi 'O2 had to fill
Ganesan's rather larger shoes in
the forward pack, and his aggressive play was sorely missed
on the wing. The contributions
of the rookies have been critical this season, and demonstrate
that its never too late to join the
team.
Swat has a week off, and
then plays its first playoff
match on the 17th. Three
more weeks of play follow,
and the Buzzards are looking
to get healthy, prepare for the
Dash for Cash, and pick on
some teams outside their difficult regular-season bracket.

Bringing
back baseball

Tide wages impressive fight
against Ursinus Bears, 21-13

by Patricia Barrientes

Staff Writer

Now that sluggers Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa have
enjoyed their duetime in the spotlight, it istime to focus on the road
to the Fall Classic. Even though
the glamorous home run record
formerly held by Roger Maris fell
this 1998 baseball season and
Oriole thirdbaseman Cal Ripken,
Jr. has ended his streak of most
consecutive games played, this
sport is still about winning and
wearing that ring. By mid-July
all the division results, except for
those from the American League
West (AL West) and the National
League wildcard, were highly
predictable. The Atlanta Braves,
the Houston Astros and the New
York Yankees had all won more
than 100 games and the spirit of
the pennant race was in jeopardy.
The wildcard restores some
of the spirit of the contest. It
does not matter what the baseball purists said about the installment of the wildcard in
1995. In the last few years this
"fourth division" has brought
baseball back to cities like New
York, San Francisco, Chicago,
Boston, and Toronto which
would otherwise have been
watching meaningless games.
Instead, teams and fans across
the country went out to the
ballpark for games this year and
watched the scoreboard to keep
up with the wildcard standings.
As expected, the wildcard race
came down to a one-game playoff and the Anaheim Angels
faded in the AL West division
race. In the first round best-offive Division Series, the Atlanta
Braves, rich in pitching and
owners of a 106-56 regular season record breezed past the Chicago Cubs, the wildcard winner.
The New York Yankees, who
scored the most wins in the
regular season since the 1906
Chicago Cubs, tamed the explosive Texas Rangers line-up, allowing them just one run in
three games. The offensivepowerhouse Cleveland Indians
received clutching hitting performances from their hitters,
especially outfielder Manny
Ramirez. Despite the individual
performance of first baseman
Mo Vaughn, the Indians eliminated the Boston Red Sox, winning three out of four games.
The best matchup in the first
round was the San Diego Padres
versus the Houston Astros series. Both teams boasted a
strong pitching staff with the
likes of Kevin Brown, Trevor
Hoffman and Randy "the Big
Unit" Johnson. However, the
post season heroics of Jim
Leyritz and strong pitching by
Kevin Brown propelled the Padres past the Astros.
Four team are left heading
into the best-of-seven League
Championship Series. Either the
San Diego Padres or the Atianta
Braves will win the NL pennant.
Though both teams have great
hitters, the games are likely to be
low scoring, pitching oriented
games. Outfielder Tony Gwynn
will lead the Padres offense, with
Kevin Brown as another big factor. Due to the strong pitching
staff, Atlanta has not yet utilized
theiryoung bullpen; theirperformance under the extreme pressure of the post season is unsure.
Nonetheless, this 1998 Atlanta
team is the best they have had in
their 1990's "dynasty." San Diego leads the series one game to
none but this series will likely be
decided in the seventh game.
The Cleveland Indians and
the New York Yankees series is
another great matchup. Both
teams have a great lineup with
equal speed, offense, and defense.
However, the Yankees have an
advantage in the strength of their
pitching staff, which moved the
team past Texas. So far the Yankees big hitters have not donethe
job, with the bulk of the offense
provided by the rookie Shane
Spencer. Like the young Braves
bullpen, the Yankees bullpen also
remains untested. The Indians do
have a strong momentum going
for them but itremains to be seen
whether or not they can replicate
the 1997 triumph in which they
bested the Yankees in the first
round of the playoffs. The Indians lost game one, but if they have
strong pitching from the likes of
Charles Nagy, this series could
also go to a decisive game seven.

To look at the halftime statistics from last
Saturday's game versus Ursinus, one would
rule out any chance for a Swarthmore victory.
The Garnet amassed a measly -8 yards on 23
rushing attempts and turned the ball over
twice.
The scoreboard, however, told another
story. The Tide played the Ursinus Bears even
and entered the locker room knotted at 7-7
despite the statistical inadequacies. The defense stifled the opponent's attack by forcing
four first half fumbles. The third fumble,
caused by a pair of dynamic freshman defenders, Joe Corso 'O2 and Randy Keim 'O2, led
to the Tide's tying score. Quarterback Scott
Murray 'Ol found Brain Bell '99 twice for
gains of 10 and 11 yards on the drive.
Donovan "I Run" Goodly 'O2 took the ball in
from the two yard line to even the score.
The young Swarthmore team emerged
from the locker room energized. On the first
play from scrimmage, Goodly 'O2 hurdled
defenders and cut back across the field to burn
the opponents with a 71 yard score. With only
25 seconds removed from the second half, the
Tide captured the lead, 13-7, to the delight of
the 1250 fans in attendance.
The defense then took the field to preserve
the lead. Adam Booth 'Ol sparked the defense
with his 13 total tackles, and John Bartner 'O2
added a fumble recovery to his 10 total tackles. Despite valiant play from Josh Klotz 'Ol
and Charles Parlapanides '99, the Bears drove

ball on their own 15 and drove to the
opposition's 26, but stalled. Tony Skiadas '99,
who caused three fumbles of the day, rallied
Swarthmore's defense. Nevertheless, the
Bears again captured the lead, 21-13, with
three minutes remaining in the third quarter.
The Garnet used its passing attack, the
"Air Raid," to torment the Bears. Murray, who
threw for 171 yards on 15 completions, connected to Bell nine times for 131 yards. Bell
earned recognition from the conference for his
205 all purpose yards. Goodly added another
100 yard performance, thanks mostly to his
fullback, Joe Aleffi'ol.
With the game on the line, the defense
forced Ursinus into three punts and never allowed the Bears inside the Swarthmore 44
yard line. Three and a half minutes remained
in the game, and the Tide had to make a move.
This time, Aleffi led the Garnet toward
the end zone with a carry of 11 yards and a
reception for 21 more. Murray found Bell five
times on this final drive to push the Tide to
the Ursinus 7 yard line. Twelve seconds were
left on the clock and the Tide lacked timeouts.
Murray rolled to his right searching for an
open receiver. The Bears, however, covered
the play well and Murray was intercepted in
the end zone with just four seconds remaining.
Reeling from this heart-wrenching loss,
the Tide will travel to Muhlenberg this Saturday, October 10. Armed with confidence,
however, the Garnet aim to build on past lessons and go out for a win.

Greg Emkey' 99

Sports Editor'
Last weekend, Greg
Emkey assured himself a
spot in the men's tennis National Rolex Tournament at
the end of this month by winning the Eastern Rolex in
both the singles and the
doubles (with Peter Schilla)
competition With a large
number of players in attendance, Emkey had to play 6
singles matches, 2 per day.
In the final, both Emkey and
his opponent were near exhaustion from this grueling
competition.
The winners from each
region are invited to attend
the national championship
October 22 to 25.
Since
there are only 8 regions, this
achievement already places
Emkey in select group of Division 111 players from across
the country.
Emkey has been playing
tennis almost as long as he
can remember, introduced to
the sport by his older brother
and father. Emkey enjoys the
competition of the game.
While he played baseball
through high school, it is tennis that he devotes himself
to. He has seen a marked
improvement in his performance in college and places
much of the credit on his

coach, Mike Mullan.
Emkey claims that this is
his best season yet, and he
still has the championships to
go. When asked about his
goals he humbly replied only,
"to do well at the Nationals."
Further than that Emkey only
offers the team goal of making Nationals in the spring.
While Emkey sees this as feasible, he hopes that Swarthmore will be able to make it
as high as the final four or beyond.
When asked to comment
on Emkey, Mullan says that
"Greg has played on the tennis team for 4 years, has improved steadily. His approach to competitive tennis
is like that of a quiet sportsman."

Hockey puts away two more
By Jean Quinn

This week, Garnet Field
Hockey downed two conference foes, including last year's
defending Co-Centennial
Champion, Washington College, to surge to a 9-2 overall
record and a record of 4-1 in
the conference. Elation from
winning the Seven Sisters
Tournament propelled the
team into a spirited week of
play which, with luck, will last
the remainder of the season.
The Garnet have a tough
schedule in front of them, taking on Ithaca, Messiah, and
Rowan, three traditionallystrong NCAA qualifiers. They
will need to continue their aggressive style if they hope to
make any post-season appearances.

Last weekend, Swat hosted
the Red Devils from Dickinson
and although they came out with
a 2-1 victory, many were surprised that the Garnet did not
outdistance their competition by
more. The contest was surprisingly scoreless at the break.

Coach Karen Borbee commented, "Dickinson did a good
job of keeping the pressure on
us offensively and not letting us
get our offense going. Mostly,
however, we did not play up to
our level of play and let
Dickinson stay in the game."
Holly Baker '99 scored both
goals with the help of Donna
Griffin '99 who assisted on
each.
It was widely expected
that the Washington/Swat contest would be as tight as the
Dickinson
The
game.
Shorewomen were one of only
two teams to topple the Garnet last season (the other was
Rowan), and their garnering a
berth in the NCAA tournament while Swat instead
hosted (and won) the ECACs
provided all the necessary
drama for an intense battle.
However, match did not prove
to be much of a contest as the
Garnet easily overpowered
their rival with a final score of
5-2.
Griffin scored within the
first two minutes of play to give
Swarthmore the edge. Washing-

tied up the game, but Griffin soon found the inside of the
cage again to give her the team
the lead for good. Lurah Hess
'99 added two goals, and Becca
Stites 'OO scored one as well.
The Shorewomen's second goal
came off a penalty stroke with
less than one minute remaining
in regulation.
Coach Borbee praised her
team for its performance. "The
Washington game was the best
we played all year. We played
great team hockey and were the
most aggressive in our scoring
circle as I've seen all season,"
she said.
Washington entered the
game ranked third in the South
Region, while Swarthmore
had been tabbed fifth in the
South Atlantic Region. In the
national coaches' poll, Washington was slotted higher than
the Garnet. But the victory
should push Swat up a few
notches. If they can defeat #8
Ithaca, Messiah, and Rowan in
the next two weeks, chances
are good that the field hockey
team's season will outlast the
regular season.
