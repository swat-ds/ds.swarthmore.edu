Faculty to Vote on
Consensual Relations
By

Arun Mohan

To address the lack of a policy on consensual relations
between faculty and staff, faculty and students, or staff and
students, the Equal Opportunities Advisory Committee
(EOAC), which consists of faculty, three student members,
and staff, presented a draft of a "consensual relations advisory statement" for discussion at the faculty meeting on
Friday, March 21. The policy will be put to vote at the
upcoming faculty meeting on Wednesday, March 2. If the
faculty votes in favor of the measure, it will make that
recommendation to the President who will make the ultimate
decision regarding the fate of the policy.
The most recent draft of the policy defines consensual
relationships as "romantic or sexual relationships that occcur
within the context ofeducational or employment supervision
and evaluaton."
In a letter to student members of the Board of Managers'
Student Life Committee, Amy Dalton '9B, a member of the
EOAC, described the statement as an intent "to clarify legal
concerns regarding consensual relations between students
and faculty or staff, or between faculty/staff who are of

differing rank. It does not explicitly state any 'consequence'
as there is nothing inherenly illegal about consensual
realations, but attempts to detail the logistical and ethical
dilemmas, as they tend to play themselves out legally. In
short, it is walking a fine line between a warning and an

information statement."
While the greater portion of the "advisory statement"
consists of strong discouragment against consensual relations, it does describe options for resolution. For example, it
states that "Faculty members or supervisors involved in

consensualrelationships are expected to remove themselves
from any activity or evaluation thatmay reward orpunish the
employee or student. If the faculty member or supervisor
cannot realistically remove or recuse him/herselffrom such
an activity, outside review should be requested to help
maintain neutrality."
While few deny the need for such a policy, several members of the College community feel that more discussion is
needed before a final decision is made. Part of their concern
is that this policy "affects three different constituencies,"

Juan Williams Speaks on Journalism Admissions Decisions for

participants criticized the
organization of the event
By George Balgobin

On Friday night a new format was tested in the
McCabe Memorial lecture series entitled "Conservative and Liberal Influences on the Media."
Juan Williams, high profile journalist for The
Washington Post and frequent commentator on
shows such as "Crossfire" and "Capital Gang",
was the keynote speaker. In addition, four Swarthmore representatives, Reuben Canada '99 of
SASS, Vincent Jones '9B of College Democrats,
Franklin Rubenstein '97, of HOLA and Hillary
Thompson '99 of SCU, joined Williams to participate in a panel discussion on media influences which followed the lecture.
Speaking to a full house on this first night of
Black Alumni Weekend, Williams kept his message short. In an attempt to demystify journalism, Williams began by addressing the lack of
respect that journalists receive. He stated, "the
portrayal of reporters in movies and television is
not too far away from the truth." Citing examples such as All the President's Men, Williams concluded that journalists are often portrayed as heroes who "turn everything into a
crisis." He quickly added that while Watergate
was, in fact, a crisis, many people in the media
view their job as a "sport" and attempt to best
their competition while possibly sacrificing journalistic integrity.
Next Williams questioned the common notion
that politicians are subject to a columnist's mercy.
As Lorrin Nelson 'OO noted, "I was very intrigued by Williams explanation of how skilled
politicians can control the media, since they have
the power to keep a journalist who gives them
unfavorabler> rage"' >
loop." Williams
''

said that it was a common fear for reporters that
they could lose their jobs if the politicians didn't
want to "play ball" with them. However, some
students weren't swayed by this argument.
Damon Taaffe '99 contested, "Williams never
this issue ofreporters' personal
really
biases. He simply recited his 'we can only print
what the politicians give us' mantra, which didn't
seem sufficient." Justin Herring '97 added to
this point relating, "The vast majority of reporters are personally liberal, and that affects how
they report the news and what they deem newsworthy." Nonetheless, Williams' plea was not a
change in the current pool of journalists, but a
call for the media not to prostitute itself for the
most extreme and controversial stories.
The ensuing panel discussion focused the political climate at Swarthmore, a different topic
than Williams addressed. Posters around campus had billed the lecture/panel discussion as
having a similar focus to the lecture, but
Rubenstein pointed out that "the panel wasn't
prepared for this topic..but we'll try to do our
best to represent the students on it." Although
the focus varied, most of the discussion centered
around questions about ideas Williams addressed
in his lecture. Another added surprise was the
announcement by Williams that one of his colleagues on The Washington Post, Cortland
Milloy, would be joining the panel. One student
said Milloy's presence did not add to the unity of
the discussion, "All he did was say, 'I think the
media is doing a great job' but he never addressed any of the questions."
Notwithstanding, the panel discussion with
audience participation did highlight some interesting issues about influences on the media. An
important issue addressed was the paradox that
most media outlets are own by people who have
conservative leanings, yet the media is broadly
thought to have a liberal bias. Williams pointed
to money as the controlling factor with this
situation. Owners are motivated by profit, and
thus their political leanings do not influence
coverage. Onadifferentnote,panelistßubenstein
brought up the idea that, "readers do not expect
a liberal viewpoint from the National Review,
any more than they expect the Post to be conservative. It depends on the publication."

Still, some students were puzzled by the format. Taaffe said, "it is not at all evident why the

panel was picked from a selective group of
ideological organizations. With questions about
corporate ownership ofmedia outlets, what does
someone's membership in HOLA, for example,
matter?" Panelist Hillary Thompson '99, also
had questions about the panel. "It was interesting that the panel was composed offour people,
only one of which a woman, and a conservative."
Speaking more to the format in general, she
added, "The panel was superfluous. With an
interesting lecturer such as Williams, people
should not have had to feel as if the panel was
there to help answer the questions."
Though the lecture and panel discussion did
not tackle the proposed topic of the political
climate at Swat, one sophomore remarked, "it
was interesting to see some notable SWatties take
on issues about the media that are not often
discussed."

2001 Mailed Yesterday
By Wendy
Kemp

It's that time of
year again. Yesterday, 4269 letters were mailed
out all over the
world from Swarthmore College, informing the applicants of the class of 2001 whether ornot
they were accepted into Swarthmore.
The pool of 4269 applicants represented a 6% increase over the number
of applicants for the class of 2000, and
also broke the College record.
Swarthmore's #1 rating in US News
and World Report, as well as the newlyrevamped web page, provided more
publicity than the College has received
in previous years, which resulting in an

increasing number of applicants.
This year's
large freshman

class taught the
admissions committee to be more
cautious as to the
number of students admitted. So from this pool of
4269 applicants, 981 students were admitted to Swarthmore as compared to
1201 last year. This number is based on
theaim ofhaving the class of 2001 consist
of between 360-370 students total, in
order to balance out this year's large
freshman class. The number of admits
represents 23% of the applicant pool
and assumes a yield of 37%. However,

The Bean Bag opened this Monday.
The coffee shop, located in the old
Jumping Cow space, will feature coffee, food and ice cream. It has a new
atmosphere, remodelled interior and
new menu.
Jim King, the owner, bought the space
and equipment from the previous owners of the Jumping Cow and remodelled
the interior for a more efficient
workspace and customer flow. The
Bean Bag had its official opening on
Monday, but opened its doors Saturday
and Sunday for a "trial run."
The Bean Bag features meat sandwiches and soups along with vegetarian
items. On the weekends there will be a
breakfast menu with options ranging
from Belgian waffles to sausage. King
and the manager of the Bean Bag, Larry

Hobdale, said they tried the breakfast
menu last weekend and it was very
popular. They will sell Richmond icecream and American Kitchen cookies,
which won the Best of Philadelphia
Chocolate Chip Cookie award.
Still, some of the old features of the
Cow will not be changed. "We don't
want to mess with the successes that
[the Jumping Cow] had," King said.
They will continue to serve the same
bagels and coffee that theirpredecessor
sold. The musical evenings and poetry
readings will continue and King and
Hobdale both expressed great interest
in having Swarthmore students perform
there
The Bean Bag's hours are: Monday
through Wednesday, 7 a.m. to 2 p.m.;
Thursday, 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Friday, 7
a.m. to midnight; Saturday, 9 a.m. to
midnight; and Sunday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Vote Planned on Policy
from Consensual, page 1

according to Eva Travers, Professor
of Education. Abbe Blum, Associate
Professor of English, noted that "at
this point any vote is premature."
Blum recalled the College's caution
to develop a policy on hate speech,
which allowed for ample discussion
in the College community on the subject.
Travers also noted the lack of staff
and student dialogue on this issue.
Dalton was asked by the committee
to take the "advisory statement" to
student members of the Student Life
Committee. In a letter dated February 24, Dalton asked members Sam
Schulhofer-Wohl '9B, Carew Kraft
'99, and Naomi Michlin '9B (who
also serves as Co-Chair of Student
Council) to examine the document
because "it has potential implications
for 'student life'." The deadline for
this comment period was February
26.
At the suggestion of several members of the College community, including Dean Ngina Lythcott, the
document was forwarded to Student
Council for evaluation and student

input. It was originally intended that
Student Council would solicit opinions from the student body about this
policy. The comment period dead-

that they masturbated less when in a relationship. Very
few students masturbated as part of their relationship.
On campus, many of the students polled expressed
their views concerning some of the taboos associated
with the act. One male freshman thought that the reason
why society disapproves of masturbation is because the
practice itself indicates "an inability to get sex." A male
sophomore echoed this sentiment saying, "Some people
feel that masturbation implies that they are not engaged in

partnered sexual activity."
A female sophomore said simply that many people
term those who masturbate, "perverts." In response to
such prevailing attitudes, one male senior says simply,
"Fuck'em if they're not in touch with their sexuality."
Additionally, students interviewed mentioned the role of
the media in glamorizing sex and thus marginalizing
masturbation as an avenue for the release of sexual
tension.
A staff member at Worth Health Center commented
that although they don't receive many requests for information on masturbation, there are a number of reference
materials at Worthfor students seeking more information
on the practice, particularly three books: Our Bodies,
Ourselves; Our Sexuality; and The College Student's
Manual on Health. Students can also set up an appointment with a nurse practioner ifthey would like to discuss

Awareness months prompt consideration
how to create lasting cultural awareness

of

At a college as traditionally liberal as Swarthmore, it is not hard to get an
event aimed at promoting cultural awareness off the ground. But what is the

long-term impact of such an event? How much influence can a single talk, say
on hate speech, have on the College community? Will it actually lead to
heightened awareness of or even increased motivation to tackle the problem
of racial tensions?
Immersion is a better solution. When one is made aware ofand exposed to
certain issues and concerns for a sustained period of time, it is likely that one
internalizes them to some extent. Asian Pacific American Heritage Month,
Black History Month and Women's History Month are good examples of this
strategy. It is one thing to think about a culture other than your own for a
specified amount of time (such as an awareness month); but it's a very
different experience to have the knowledge of another culture become a
lasting part of your consciousness.
The student efforts in organizing Asian Pacific American Heritage Month
are certainly laudable.The event consists of talks ranging from the challenges
of studying Asian American women's history to examining East Asian
religions. It also includes a display in McCabe featuring examples of traditional East Asian attire. The planned activities highlight some important
aspects of this shared heritage, while making it clear that there are essential
distinctions between the different East Asian cultures that are represented.
But there is a further advantage to these events—they provide a closer look
at the culture and people. The media and literature do not necessarily provide
a complete and accurate portrayal of the topics and issues they choose to
cover. Furthermore, each person's perspective on an experience is reflective
of his or her personal beliefs, stereotypes, assumptions, and concerns.
Reading a book on any culture cannot be a substitute for having a conversation
with a person or experiencing that culture firsthand.
Awareness months are beneficial because they remind us of the importance
ofcultural awareness, but something must necessarily stay with us during the
other eleven months of the year.
Cultural awareness does not mean learning through isolated events and
activities concerning a limited set of experiences. It means developing a
deeper and more encompassing understanding of other cultures and the
myriad voices that comprise them.

Student participation key to diversifying faculty
Since the searches for African American History, Latin American History
and Asian American Literature professors have recently ended, this seems an
appropriate occasion to discuss faculty diversity. This topic also becomes
especially relevant in light of Swarthmore's increasingly diverse student
body which demands an increase in faculty diversity. The initialreleases of
admissions statistics for the class of 2001 are consistent with the College's
promise of increasing the diversity of the student body, and we applaud this.
But having diverse students is not enough if we still do not achieve a truly
diverse campus. Because professors fulfill many roles in a student's life—as
a teacher, adviser, and mentor—some students of color may feel more
comfortable with a professor of color. Moreover, all students would highly
benefit from a variety ofperspectives, and having professors ofcolor provides
one source of this sort of diversity.
Swarthmore's record of hiring diverse faculty is not a particularly promising one. Currently, there are 17 tenure track professors ofcolor out of a total
of 157. On a campus where more than six percent ofstudents is Latino/a, we
now have four tenure track Latino/a professors.
Many of the departments of the College are working hard to diversify their
faculty when completing new faculty searches. The English and History
departments spent additional money in the recent hiring process to make sure
that information of the open position reached a wide variety of potential
candidates.
The English and Physics departments were especially welcoming of
students during their most recent interview processes. Students, including
some from SAO, were heavily involved in bringing four Asian American
candidates to campus for the final cut for the Asian American Literature
position, and in ultimately selecting an energetic, community-oriented professor. Physics students attended introductory and advanced lectures by
candidates for the open position, and were given a chance to voice their
opinions.
Swarthmore students serve as advocates from outside of the departments
who can speak from a different perspective about the needs of the student
community. Students are also important judges ofhow an applicant will be as
a professor and he or she can fit into the student community.
However, some departments have not been as diligent in following such
practices to promote faculty diversity. This includes a lack of uniformity in
the level of student participation in the various departmental searches.
When speaking about faculty diversity, among many other topics, allowing
students a place at the deliberation table provides them with an opportunity
to voice what is needed in our rapidly diversifying community. While adding
students to every search team certainly does not guarantee a diverse faculty,
it is certainly one of the most valuable methods to reach that end.

Why we're a day early

In the past few years our federal
government has devoted a great deal
of time and energy to thwarting a
Social Security crisis. As the
babyboomers enter their golden years,
many analysts believe, they will
quickly deplete the
Social Security trust
fund which
currently
enjoys a
surplus of
money that
shadows the
true dimensions of our
government
debt. Given
that the dramatic increase of older
Americans in the near future cannot
be avoided, one would have a hard
timearguing against doing something
to keep Social Security solvent.However I wonder if this will result in the
government ignoring the problems
posed by the growing poverty among
twenty-somethings.
Once upon a time, poverty among
senior citizens presented a majorproblem for the country. Older Americans were forced to resort to eating
dog food, inhabit substandard living
quarters, and dowithoutmuch needed
medical treatment due to the lack of
an adequate income. In response to
this problem, the federal government

created Social Security which provided financial support for senior citizens. And largely due to Social Security, poverty among senior citizens
has been reduced dramatically. In
fact, poverty among elderly Americans has fallen to about 1 2% from the
near 30% poverty rate among that
group which existed when the program began in 1966.
In contemporary times, poverty
poses a greater problem for children
and twenty-somethings. Transformations in the global economy due to
the proliferation of computers, increasing mobility of capital, and advances in telecommunications have
completely changed the world in
which young people must be prepared to enter. Due to the dramatic
decline ofindustrial jobs in America,
students graduating from high school
without attending college have fewer
stable career options. In the past, noncollege-bound studentscould attain a
job in the manufacturing sector which
could provide them with enough income to support a family and live
above the poverty line.
However, the "forgotten half," or
the 50% of high school graduates
who go directly in the job market
must often settle for low-paying jobs
in the service sector which do not
sufficiently (if at all) provide opportunities for development and/or enhancement of skills necessary to succeed in more stable and lucrative,
career-oriented jobs.
As a result, young people spend a

greater time period unemployed or
without secure sources ofincome and
enough money to support a family.
To make matters worse, college students do not enjoy the luxury of guaranteed jobs after graduation. Although the likelihood of their career
advancement farexceeds that of noncollege graduates, both groups suffer
from the lack of job security characteristic of today's job market.
In addition, many college students
must bear the burden of huge loans
after graduation. Given the insane
amounts colleges and universities
expect students and their families to
pay each year, most people must borrow thousands of dollars to receive
the benefits of a college education.
While the government subsidizes
most student loans and allows for
some flexibility in repayment of college debt, many young people still
must deal with large debt-to-earning
ratios in order to get a college degree.
The nation should react to this problem in the same manner it did when
faced with severe poverty among senior citizens. Some possible solutions would be to increase access to
college grants versus student loans,
stabilize college tuition costs, allow
students to deduct more of their educational expenses and debts from their
taxable income, better prepare high
school students to make the transition from school to careers, and unions
should demand "living" wages. These
initiatives would improve access to
affordable higher education, prepare

students to enter the workforce just
as well as primary and secondary
schools equip them for college, and
relieve a great deal of the economic
burden placed on this age group.
These endeavors would yield even
greater success if young people began exhibiting more responsibility.
For instance, twenty-somethings
should take more precautions not to
have children before they're able to
properly provide for a family. Early
pregnancy not only contributes to
poverty among twenty-somethings,
it can also disrupt their schooling,
hence creating a downward spiral for
the individuals and theirchildren who
depend upon them to survive. When
it comes down to it, young people
need to stop thinking so short-term
and should not always expect instant
gratification. Such behavior would
encourage greater preparation for the
long-term and greater consideration
of available options among younger
Americans.
We, as anation, must acknowledge
the growing gap between therich and
the poor and the implications of this
situation to our social cohesion.Moreover, much attention must be placed
on the characteristics of the inhabitants ofboth groups and the probable
causes for such realities. In other
words, we must question, why people
of color, women, and young people
overpopulate the lower end of the
socioeconomic ladder. More importantly, we must do something about it
before it's too late.

All Hatred is Wrong, Whatever the Color
To the Editor:
In seventh grade, when our history
class studied thelife ofMartinLuther

simple definition: Racism is considering a person as a part of his race
instead of as an individual. Nearly
seven years later, I still consider our
seventh grade definition of racism
accurate.

If you accept my definition of racism—judging a person by his skin
color instead of his moral character —and find racism repugnant, then
certainly you were as incensed as I

March 21 article. Week after week, I
have read Vincent's articles that hurl
insults at the imaginary monster
Vincent calls "White America." And
like everyone who disagrees with
Vincent, I have remained silent until
now, satisfied to let the content ofhis
articles prove his ignorance.
Vincent's latestcolumn contains a
surprisingly insightful comment that
has moved me to publicly challenge
his dogma. Vincent writes, "if you're
not part of the solution [to ending
racism], then you're part of the problem." He is correct. I now see that as
an American who believes that the
greatest problem my nation faces is
racism, I must publicly attack the
ideas thatVincent champions—if left
unchecked, his ideas may spread, and
perhaps even be considered reasonable.
Vincent begins, "I personally do
not believe that Black people can be
termedracist given that White people
enjoy a monopoly of the political and
economic power in this country."
How convenient. Vincent has just
said that his skin color entitles him to
wash his hands of the crimeofracism
and crucify "White America" without being called a bigot. Not only is
Vincent's statement a poor effort to
justify his bigotry, but it is also factually incorrect.The word "monopoly"
implies that our nation has no leaders
whose skin color is black. Apparently Vincent forgets that General
(and possible presidential candidate)
Colin Powell, Supreme Court Justice
Clarence Thomas, Senator Carol
Moseley-Braun, Congressman J.C.
Watts, and late Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown are just five of
many public servants whose skin
color is black and who are respected
and admired by Americans of all

Positive Thinking is Key to Race Relations

Next, Vincent shares how a woman
he knows once made the outrageous
suggestion that "of course Black
people can be racist." He then justifies the racial hatred that some black
people feel toward white people.
Vincent writes, "I would ask for you
to provide reason for them [black
people] not to harbor some type of ill
feelings towards White people given
the history of Black people in this
country..." I'll give you a reason,
Vincent: All hatred is wrong. Hatred
is unproductive. Hatred divides
people, and our nation is divided
enough already. The past cannot be
changed, Vincent, but we control the
future. Only by forgiving those who
are too ignorant to understand the
evils of their bigotry will our nation
unite and conquer racism. Vincent's
suggestion that white people could
justly hate black people if black
people "screwed over" white people
is also wrong. Love, not hate, will
heal our nation: we must pity racists,
not despise them.
Vincent continues in a new gentler
tone and actually concedes that "all
White people are not devils." Thank
you, Vincent. But he quickly qualifies his concession and writes, "I have
yet to see a large number of White
people using their power, familial
connections, wealth, etc., to end racism... Until that occurs, I believe the
majority of White America is part of
the problem [of racism]."
At last we see the fundamental
flaw in Vincent's philosophy illuminated by our definition of racism:
Vincent sees himself and others as
part of a race, not as individuals. He
truly believes the fallacy that all
people with white skinpossess power,
familial connections, and wealth. He
honestly believes that no one with
black skin can be racist. This belief
individuals are only a part of their
race—allows Vincent to toss around
the terms Black and White America
so freely and lets an ugly strain of
bigotry thrive in an otherwise compassionate and intelligent man.
All my life I have believed in Martin King's dreamof harmony between
Americans of different races. And so
articles such as Vincent Jones's column of March 21 sadden me.
Yes, Vincent, I am "disheartened
or upset by the harshness of [your]
words [and] the nature of [your] conclusions" but not for the reasons you
suspect. Every week, when I read
your column, I see a potential leader
someone whose warm personality
could bring people together—use his
intelligence and talent as a writer to
spread bigotry and racial division.
Recognize your flaws, Vincent, and
change. No, I am not asking "an
abused person to feel completely comfortable around the person responsible for their[sic] pain." I am asking
a good but misguided person to see
the truth.

To the Editor:
In his column last week, Vincent
Jones suggested, among otherpoints,
that unless white people are actively
committed to solving racial discrimination, they are part of the problem.
By cataloging some of the injustices
done to blacks in this country,
Vincent underscores his argument.
He also intends, if I am not mistaken, to encourage white people to
work towards improving race relations—so that they are not part of
the "problem." On that last account
I believe Vincent's argument does
not have the desired affect.
It is no stretch to claim that some
people respond well to calls to action based on guilt, especially at
Swarthmore. And guilt may be a
logical outcome if you believe that
blacks are and have been systematically persecuted by white society.
But most people—certainly, the vast
majority of non-Swatties —are not
primarily motivated by guilt. This is
my major complaint with race relations activists, who are constantly
lamenting the state of affairs in this
country. If you always insist that
race problems are getting worse or
are always on the edge of a crisis,
people have less incentive to get
involved. Ifthings are always going
to be bad, why bother trying to help?
Furthermore, because so few
people respond positively to arguments by guilt, race activists hurt
their cause when they negatively
generalize about entire groups of
people. Intended or not, the conclusion that many people have drawn
from Vincent's article is that he believes most white people are racist.
When I first came here, I heard the
argument that passive opposition is
morally equivalent to passive support. And it made sense to me. Since
then, however, I have rejected it.
Because when people are told they
are racists, or passive racists, they
shut off. And when they shut off, we

Imposition

can no longer reach them. Certainly,
we can't expect them to help us.
Because I care about improving race
relations, I pay close attention to the
results, not the intentions, of race activists. And on that account I think we
have done poorly in making our case.
Getting people involved means persuading people in the terms that they
understand. The people who, deep
down inside, believe they are racists,
aren't going to help improve race relations no matter what we say. For the
remainder of people, who do not believe .they are racists, attacking them
will not inspire them to action. And
when we tell someone or imply that he
is racist, we are attacking them at a
fundamental level. Instead, here is what
I think people who care about improving race relations, by encouraging others to participate, need to do.
First, we need to admit, no, shout
out loud, thesubstantial improvements
that have been won through hard work
in the last 30 years in curbing racial
discrimination and opening opportunities. The U.S. is a better place, racially speaking, than it was 30 years
ago, and we need to be honest about
that. As much as we feel that more
work must be done, people like to
know that their contribution can make
a difference.
Secondly, instead of appealing to
guilt to encourage people to get involved, we should use positive arguments. Investing time and energy to
improve race relations makes sense,
not just because people before us (or
around us) have done hurtful things,
but because better race relations make
the world a better place.
We need to make a positive case for
less racism and more diversity. Because the case can be made. And if and
when we make it, and when we are
honest about the advances made to
date in race relations, we will have
furthered the cause of ending racial
discrimination.
Matt Van Itallie '9B

of Political Power Isn't a Race Issue

To the Editor:
I would like to announce to
Vincent Jones, regarding his article
last week, that I do not care about
"Black America."Nor do I care about
"White America," or "Tall
America," or "Short America." I
value the flourishing of individual
humanbeings, especially those who
take pride in what they have chosen
to be, rather than in having unchosen
characteristics in common with others.
While I have pale skin, I do not
have much political power. But if I
did, I still would not impose my
beliefs on others with the coercive
power of the government. I would
not threaten with force those who
preferred to interact with, or not
interact with, people of a certain
race, sex, or sexual orientation, even

ifI thought their actions were wrong.
For if I did such things, I would be
like modern liberals, conservatives,
and whip-in-hand slave drivers of the
Old South: I would use force to get
people to do what I wanted them to
do.
I do not believe groups have rights.
Only the smallest minority has rights:
the individual.
If a person has a right to not sell his
labor to someone based on race,
doesn't someone looking to buy labor have the right to not hire a laborer
based on race? Does it matter whether
the people involved are black or white,
or buying or selling? People should
be free to interact with each other on
terms they both consent to. Any other
form of relationship is like that of
master and slave.

Crash Exemplifies Cronenberg's Body Of Work
By

Patrick "Tenebre" Runkle

Just

wait until you see what David

Cronenberg has cooked up this
time. Cronenberg, the Canadian

master of horror and suspense movies, has concocted one of the most

interesting movies I' ve ever seen with
Crash, a tale of sex and car crashes.
Crash is an adaptation of J.G.
Ballard's book of the same name, and
it deals with a secret sect of automobile accident victims who derive
sexual pleasure from witnessing and
being involved in intense car crashes.
It stars James "This ain't Stargate"
Spader as James Ballard, who at the
beginning of the film is involved in a
head-on crash which leaves him severely injured. The driverof the other
car dies, and the driver's wife, Dr.
Remington, played by Holly Hunter,
is also hurt.
Shortly after being released from
the hospital, the two survivors meet
while claiming their cars from the
impound lot. They engage in passionate sex in the front seat of
Ballard's new car. The audience is

left speechless.
Soon after, Ballard, Ballard's wife
(played with gusto by Deborah Unger)
and Dr. Remington become involved
with a man named Vaughn (Elias
Koteas), who likes to recreate celebrity car crashes, and who has, of
course, strange car crash sexual fe-

tishes.
The film is basically a series of sex
scenes in and around automobiles.
Most are extremely explicit, some
homosexual. Crash is rated NC-17
and almost lost its American distributor when Ted Turner, owner of
Fine Line studios, saw the movie
and was tremedously offended.
There was a big controversy about
the moviebefore it was released, but
now it has opened and no one seems
to care. It's too strange to actually
touch off a wave of anything.
Crash is not the first David
Cronenberg film to raise eyebrows,
and it will certainly not be the last.
Cronenberg isbest-known in America
for his brilliant 1985 horror remake
The Fly, starring Jeff Goldblumand
Geena Davis. The movie, for all its

chills, is still Cronenberg-lite.
Cronenberg'searlier movies, however, are pretty much a genre of their
own. He redefined the horror movie;
instead ofmaking movies about monsters and zombies, Cronenberg made
moviesabout horrible things that happen internally to people, that make
the body and mind break apart, and
lead to paranoia, madness, and disin-

sexual intercourse. The parasites, unfortunately, make their victims into
sex-crazed zombies, and so the disease spreads with horrifying speed.

Aliens at Swat? Make it So
By

Patrick "Tenebre" Runkle
and Jeremy Mathias
& Julia Sable

liMars

Attacks! proves anything,
it's that $BO million will buy lots
of nifty special effects. Tim
Burton's latest black comedy is an
epic assault on our sensibilities, a
twisted flip-side to Independence Day
in which the world is coming to an
end and no one seems to care.
Mars Attacks! is something of an
experiment from Burton, the gifted
director of Beetlejuice, Batman, and
Edward Scissorhands. It's a multicharacter disaster epic about a martian invasion that's actually a huge
joke. JackNicholsonand Glenn Close
are the President and First Lady,
Pierce Brosnan is a research scientist, Martin Short a Presidential aide,
Annette Bening a kooky Las Vegas
alcoholic, and Pam Grier a concerned
D.C. resident. The list goes on and
on; the cast is certainly terrific.
The real core of Mars Attacks!,
though, are hundreds of little computer-generated Martians that come
to Earth and pretty much vaporize
everything in their paths. It's done in
cheesy 50s style, but of course is
supposed to be hip to 90s sensibilities. The main joke of the movie
seems to be thateveryone who should
be worried about the martians is too
busy worrying about something else
and lets half the planet get vaporized
in the process.
Mars Attacks! has some amazing,
ridiculous, and very, very funny special effects. The computer-generated
martians are a breakthrough in movie
special effects; they're so convincing
and yet so cartoonish and unbelievable. They run around on their huge
spinning saucer spacecraft, carry big,
bright ray guns, and have bulging
brains for heads.
Unfortunately, Mars Attacks! can't
get past its special effects. Tim
Burton's movies are often so strong
visually thatthe characters get pushed
to the background. Sometimes it

works and creates a stunning atmosphere, like in EdwardScissorhands.
In Mars Attacks!, however, Burton
has a terrific cast and pretty much
squanders them all. After a long prologue in which all the characters are
introduced and we wait for the aliens
to arrive, they show up and all the
characters are just discarded as the
butts ofspecial effectjoke sequences.
Some of them are clever, but I wanted
a whole lot more substance to the
satire.
In fact, when I think back on the
experience ofwatching MarsAttacks!
I remember lots of things that made
me laugh (some more than others),
but the movie seems more like a
sophomoric send-up than the social
commentary that itsmakers intended.
As with most Burton movies, there
are tons and tons of great ideas but no
focus and no follow-through. It's really too bad the movie tries to be so
broad and epic, because I think it is
precisely the movie's too-broad canvas that makes MarsAttacks! so easy
to forget.
Still, for those ofus snoring through
most other feel-good Hollywood attractions, Mars Attacks! will show
you lots you haven't seen before.
The production values are perfect,
and the loud music score by Danny
Elfman is a real treat. If you can
forget the people and just focus on
those silly little martians, you'll have
a blast. No pun intended, of course.
Ack, ack.

You

Nothing

It's

time to lock n' load, boys,
because the season is upon us.
Yes, the prospective students are
here and this year's batch seems particularly ornery.
There's nothing I hate more than a
spec. Okay, well maybe there are a
few things I hate more than a spec.
Racial injustice, for example. The
clubbing of baby harp seals, and Family Circus. But right up there with all
these most hated things are specs.
Of course, I know I shouldn't hate
specs. Their very existence is essential for the propagation of this great
institution of learning. They provide
the tangible evidence which shows
that Swarthmore is, in fact, the #1
liberal arts college in the nation. After
all, we were all specs once, right?
Yeah, but I also was once a zygote.
And just because I was a zygote
doesn't mean I want to hang out with
other zygotes now, much less take
them to class and introduce them to
my friends. I mean, what are you
going to say to a zygote other than
asking it when it is going to develop
a hand so ithas something with which
to hold its beer?
Well just the other day a prospective student happily boundedinto one
of my classes and placed her wellrested, well-fed self into one of the
chairs: The professor was extremely
kind to the young 'un, asking the
class to introduce ourselves to the
spec and then giving her a brief overview of the class subject before beginning the lecture. Twenty minutes
into the class period, I looked over
and noticed our once perky little visitor had fallen asleep. I was aghast. If
anyone has a right to fall asleep in
class, it is an honest to goodness,
undernourished, sleep deprived, overstressed, Swarthmore studentlike me.
Plump, rested high schoolers with
clean clothes and good hygiene have
no business dozing in my class. I and
I alone reserve that privilege.
And to add insult to injury, I heard
the same spec complaining about the
Herr's nacho cheese flavored tortilla
chips in Tarble. Well, yes, those chips
are probably the worst faux cheese
chips every made. They are an abomination against nature. They are bastard Doritos not fit for human consumption. Eating one is like licking a
lint trap that has been soaked in vinegar and salt. I would rather be a
member of Student Council than eat
a bag of those chips, but nevertheless, specs have no business complaining. Someday, a bag of Herr's

shouldn't even be allowed to speak

Plus, specs never have any idea
where they're going and nothing you
can say will ever help them. A typical

Data (Brent Spiner) is also infected

strong feelings. The plot runs along
the same line as most other Trek

moral conflict, pat resolution. The
Borg, those half-robot, half-humanoid monstrosities, travel back in time

Wind:
Finding Thrills for $5.95 in San Fran
Toughest Opponent
By

John Derderian

Springbreak is popularly conceived as a time ofbad beer and bad morals. The image of drovesof fratboys in their fratmobiles cruising
down 1-95 believing that they've got a chance with the cashier at the Stuckeys off the Roanoke Rapids exit, is enough to make any
Swattie squirm. Fortunately, the Swarthmore men's tennis
team had to make a business trip to California over break, thus
keeping themselves above such petty debauchery...sort of.
Arriving in San Francisco on Saturday, the team was happy
to see a Weight Watchers support group partying down in the
hotel ballroom. Freshman John Leary relished the evening
leading the soused crew in a beautiful rendition of "Big Girls
Don't Cry." The rest of the team got spare-changed to death in
wonderfully seedy Berkeley, and junior Roger Werner got a
big bang out of the evening (to the tune of $5.95). On Sunday
the team defeated Berkeley's top ranked club team with a
strong showing by the bottom half of the singles lineup. The
doubles also performed well, setting the tone for season trend.
Next the Bandits took on Foothill, the top junior college in the
country. After securing the doubles points with wins by John
Derderian and Greg Emkey at #2 and John Temin and John

Leary at #3, the team was a little overwhelmedby the tenacious
all court games of their opponents, as well as faced with the reality of their limited outdoor experience thus far.
On Tuesday Swarthmore traveled to Santa Cruz—the apparent spawning ground of the VW bus. Here, Swarthmore was not defeated
so much by their opponents as by culture shock. The natural beauty of the place was evident by the high mountains and grassy valleys
in one place. Even next year's frontrunner for student council president, sophomore Steve Richards, was quick to point out that "this
place does not suck!" Senior Paul Wachter wasn't so enthused, claiming that the people were weird. In fact he claimed this directly
to most of the people's faces which left Swarthmore with a little PR problem in that neck of the woods. Still the Bandits had to be
impressed by the camaraderie and spirit of Santa Cruz, realizing that this is the attitude required of a National Championship team.
Swat's only point came in a tough fought win bv standout Learv at #6 singles over some dude named "Corndog."
Next up for the Bandits was some down time in which they enjoyed the regular San Fran sights and smells (mostly green and moist).
They ventured to the Golden Gate, Coit Tower, the Haight and all the rest. Coach Mullan, perhaps a little salty about the two game
slide, was a bit perturbed at the tardiness of a few team members to a rendezvous—but time really ceases to hold any meaning when
in the throes of a Pub induced splendor. Anyhow the team made it down to Southern Californiafor the Claremontmatch. After a night
of $5.95 bliss (and Wachter getting some sort ofcabin fever), the team was ready to turn things around. They started off by winning
the doubles point, and then managed to squeeze out three singles wins for the 4-3 victory. Derderian out-pushed his opponent at #1
singles, while Emkey drove the nail in the coffin with a tough three set victory at #5. Excited withthe win, the team feasted and hopped
the red-eye back to Philly.
Feeding the impression that they are on the ATP tour, the Bandits spent the following weekend in Atlanta Here they were determined
to follow Sherman's example and burn the city to the ground. Upon arriving, the team was forced straight into action against a tough
Pomona squad. The doubles point was converted on the strength of a suck it up performance by Ed "Easy E" Ernst and Werner at #1
doubles. The singles proved a battle again with Werner winning at #2, Steve "Mister Positivity" Richards stomping his opponent at
#3, and Leary proving once again to be the sure win at #6. In the end, Swat owned a 4-3 victory.
After a restful night (there was no $5.95 happiness), the bandits headed to the courts of Emory to take on last year's NCAA finalists.
After #3 doubles came back from two match points down, Swarthmore proceeded to look tough in singles, with Werner taking down
an Ail-American and Richards pouncing on second serves. Leary, facing the fratboy heckling and an annoying assistant coach showed
everybody who's daddy with a third set bagel. This provided the Bandits withtheirthird 4-3 victory in a row. As the weekend continued
(and the numbers began to dwindle in Derderian's van due to suspect station selection by Wachter), Swat traveled to Olympic park and
played Depauw.
No, not Depaul, Depauw. If it helps, it's the small school in Indianawhere Dan Quayle went. Swat showed no mercy, winning the
doubles point in spite of a monumentalhook at #3 which left Mullan muttering something about Brandt Lincoln '95. The singles proved
rather one sided with Swarthmore sweeping #2 through #9. Wachter kept up his undefeatedseason at #B, and freshman Sasha "where
the hell does this guy disappear to on road trips" Sheehan, continued to run his opponents into the ground at #7. Mullan is optimistic
for the team's future, but Derderian and Wachter say the future is now. The Bandits are convinced this is the best team they've had
in years and are hoping all of the Swarthmore community will be out for the match against Amherst this weekend. The contest will

Women Ruggers' First Encounter
against Lehigh Proves Victorious
Amber

By

Halsey

&

Jen

hilpott

On Saturday, the Swarthmore women's
rugby team faced Lehigh University, a team
they had never played before. The Swat
ruggers gained two shutout victories (15-0,
15-0).
In the A-side game, Christina Costas '99,
weak side wing, scored her first try in the first
of the game.The try was set up in the first five
minutes of the game after an impressive
rucking series by the forward pack and a pass
from scrum half Jen Philpott '97. The second
try was scored shortly after the first by an
impressive culminating effort from the dominant Swarthmore pack. Philpott, hooker
Amber Halsey '9B and strong side flanker,
captain Hanan Hussein '97 carried out this
feat. The third try, scored much like the
second, took place during the second half but
was touched down by Hussein alone.
Hussein toldthe team before the game, I'm
really nervous and I always play best when
I'm nervous; this will be a good game."
Hussein was correct in her estimation of the
team's capabilities, as theSwarthmore women
ruggers crushed Lehigh. Bridget Arbour '9B,
as expected, played an outstanding offensive
and defensivegame while providing her team-

mates withvaluable insight at half time. Cori

Garrett-Goodyear '99 and Becky Snyder '9B,
the props, proved their endurance while lifting continuously in lineouts, and ran the ball
frequently in open field play.
The back line had a very impressive game
and was able to handle the ball much better
under drier conditions than when they played
University of Pennsylvania. Courtney Clark
'9B overcame her nervousness in her new
position at fly half and played a very confident game. Megan Brennan 'OO, full back
extraordinaire, displayed her amazing kicking accuracy when Philpott directed her to
kick a ball to "the man in the purple shirt on
the sidelines." Brennan did exactlv that. After "the man in the purple shirt" caught
Brennan's kick, even the referee proclaimed
his amazement at her accuracy.
The B-Side game was equally impressive.
Pia Houseal '97, having already played in the
A-side game, scored on her first try in the Bside game. Houseal stole the ball during
Lehigh's lineout and proceeded to dramatically hurdle her body into the try zone for five
points. Danielle D' Olivera 'OO scored her
first try in her debut performance on the
rugby field. D' Olivera proved to be a quick
learner and a fast runner in addition to scoring

points for Swarthmore. D' Olivera
exuberantly squealed before the
game, "I'm so excited to be here! I
can't wait to play!" In the second
half, Sarah Cross' 99, an experienced
prop, scored her third try off of a
ruck.
Lara Estroff '97 and Becca Hover
'99 played extremely well in the forward pack and showed a lot ofintensity throughout the game. Lynn
Matthews '9B, Kira Cochran-Bond
'OO and Kirstin Knox '99 played
with skill and determination in
the back line. Senior Elin Lisska
provided leadership for the largely
rookie back line at her position at
fly half. Joan Hoffman '9B, who
replaced Houseal in the second
half after also playing an entire
A-side game, commented, "Bside played really well last week,
but they are even better this m
week!"
Next Wednesday, the Swarth- m
more women's ruggers will face
tough opposition against the nationally competitive West Chester
University squad.

Swarming Earthworms' Report

Playing Hard Down in Maryland
By

Marco Rietveld

This past weekend the Swarming Earthworms took second at the Kobayashi Maru
tournament held at the University of Maryland. Windy conditions on both days influenced play, as well as the lack of a full team
on Sunday, when only one substitute player
was available.
Swarthmore ultimate beat the Carnegie
Mellon Yuk, the Salisbury State Buzz, and
the University of Virginia ultimate team on
Saturday, but lost to the Pennsylvania State
Spank, whom they also came up against in
the finals. In the quarter finals against the
University of Maryland Space Bastards, the
'Worms had an easy game, winning 12-7
although the Bastards had a nearly twice-aslarge team. In fact, complaints about being
unable to tire Swarthmore out were overheard at halftime.

Delaware Sideshow, who have consistently
played well through the years. The game was
"hot" with star performances by all eight
Swarthmore players, ending with a score of
15-10. Great moments included some amazing grabs by Ali Momeni '97, four unbelievable endzone catches by Roger Bock '99,
classic defensive form by the "Minister of
Defense," Robin Mandel '97, and surprise
turnovers caused by defensive blocks or
catches on the part of Marco Rietveld, and
Mike Morton '97. As usual, David Lewis '97
and David Sacker '97 played fast and furiously, and Vincent Pallaver, a first-year, continued to show some great talent.
However, Swarthmore's fatigue caught up
with them in the finals. Although Pennsylvania State was also tired from their semi-finals
against Princeton, who went 12-15 against
them, Spank won 13-8 against the 'Worms.
Spank's new offensive plays, and team depth
led to a comeback of 7-4 by halftime from
Swarthmore's strong start of 3-0.

Windy conditions on Saturday
led to the use of much "zone"
play, in which the defense concentrated on limiting throws to
swings and dumps. This type of
play counted on the lack of perfect throwing by the offense as
well as mistakes in judging defensive capabilities or effects of
the wind on the disc.
The Swarming Earthworms
also had some excellent cheering
from local friends and parents, as
well as from the women's ultimate team in the finals, who even
helped provide one traditional
end-of-game-cheer after the final
game. In this area, Mandel
showed his rhyming talents, incorporating such words as "corporeal" and "Montoban," the last
name of an actor, in the cheers for
the opposing team.

High windscould not deter theWarmothers
when they traveled to the University of Maryland this weekend for the first regular season
tournament.
Holding their own against
Nature's worst, theWarmothers walked away
Sunday with an impressive 4-1 record and a
second place finish overall.
For the first game on Saturday, Swarthmore found themselves face to face with their
host, UMaryland. Using the favor of the
down wind, the Warmoms scored quickly
with a pass from Courtney Harter '97 to Kate
Walker '97 in the endzone. The game stayed
a tie until the Warmothers broke the stalemate by scoring on their upwind point. From
that point on, Swat was unstoppable with
their zone defense and impeccable offense
ending the game, 10-4. Both teams realized
what was blowing in the wind was more than
a simple frisbee.
Employing their tactics from the first game,
Swarthmore took on William & Mary. Winning a quick 9-3 battle, the Warmothers were
anxious to start their toughest opponent of the
day, Penn State. With the winds picking up
and the sun going down, the two teams gave
it their all. Swarthmore easily scored on their
downwind points while Penn State had to
fight harder to maintain their downwind
points. Katy Herrod '97 set the pace with her

layout defense, showing Penn State that
Swarthmore Ultimate was better than ever.
The cup of captain Mandy Hourihan '9B, Jill
Eaton '99 and Mina Kim '99 stayed strong,
forcing Penn State to turn over the disk,
giving the Swat offense a chance to kick it in.
Led by Harter, visiting Cathy Wirth '99 and
Simone Brant '99, the handlers were able to
get the frisbee upwind to Hourihan in the
endzone. The Warmothers went back to the
Mortons undefeated, beating Penn State, 11-

7.
Running on the adrenalineof Saturday, the
Warmothers were ready for another day of
play. After stalling the game as long as
humanly possibly, Swarthmore played University of Delaware, who appeared in their
first tournament. Winning 11-4, the
Warmothers got psyched for their final game
of the weekend against Princeton, who were
also going into the game undefeated. Switching over to a man to man defense, Swarthmore held their own but in the end fell to
pressure of exhaustion. Though Princeton
won the match, 11-4, the game highlighted
the cutting ability by poppers Gena Merliss
'97 and Anna Sugden-Newberry '99.
Resting upafter a tiring but fulfilling weekend, the Warmothers will be gearing their
practices towards this coming weekend's
home tournament against several colleges
including arch-rival Haverford.

Club Volleyball

Unable to Stop the Fords
By George Matula

Paul Hsu '9B, tri-captain of the men's volleyball team, with the game on the line, rose
high above the net and the Ford defenders to
drill a perfect outside set from Dylan
Humphrey '9B at a sharp angle into the open
court for one of his many kills. This great
play gave Swarthmore's club team the serve
and another chance to pull out the third set.
The Garnet took a 1-1 record to the home of
the Haverford Fords this Tuesday. The members of the Swarthmore Men's Club Volleyball Team were quite confident that they,
could beat the Fords this year. "Yeah, we are
quite confident that we can beat the Fords this
year," said Matthew Sossland '97. Fueling
this confidence was the fact that they have
recruited many freshman, including starting
outside hitter Charles "Naples" Ellis 'OO.
The confidence that the team exhibited in
the warm-up seemedwell-founded when they
quickly pulled an early 10-4 lead. The Garnet

Gamers were passing, setting, and hitting the
ball extremely well. However, the Fords
fought back with their great setting and powerful outside hitters. The Garnet found themselves even with Haverford at 14. Then a
problem which has played past volleyball
teams surfaced. The team failed to communicate on one crucial play and they let the ball
drop. This gave Haverford the go-ahead
point and eventually the set.
The second set was disastrous. All the
skills that had started with the tide had ebbed.
The Garnet ended up losing the set 0-15.
The team searched for answers, and eventually found some, for they gained their original form for the final set. The Garnet played
like the team in the first set with some monstrous blocks from George "The Spatula"

just too much for Swarthmore went on to lose
14-16. The Garnet's next match is against
Washington College tomorrow night at 7:30

In the short history of Centennial
Conference baseball, Swarthmore has
seen life at bothends ofthe standings.
In the first two years of conference
play, the Garnettook up what seemed
like permanent residence in the cellar, registering 5-28 and 10-27 seasons. Last year, the Garnet came out
with guns blazing, blasting their way
to a much improved 17-13-1 record,
good for a third place tie in the conference. On the way to fourth place,
the Garnet bludgeoned Centennial
Conference pitching with a lineup
that featured six .300 or better hitters
and the conference stolen base champion.
Unfortunately for first year head
coach Frank Agovino, much of that
ammunition is gone. Only two regulars remain from last year's lineup,
Pat Straub '97 and Jeremy Bonder
'97. Straub, a first team All-Centennial pick last year as an outfielder,
moves behind the plate with the graduation of Drew Clayton and Jeff
Spritzer. Straub appears to be picking up where he left off last year,
hitting a torrid .909 (10-11) over the
last four games.
Bonder returns to his usual spot at
second base, a position he has owned
for the past four years. WhileBonder
lacks Straub's power,he has a patient
eye at the plate and is a solid contact
hitter for the the top of the lineup.
Pan Malkoun '97, who spent last

freshmen. George Rosenbaum 'OO

The pitching staffhas been victimized often in the earlygoing. A young
lineup and less than stellar fielding
has hampered them at times, but that
is not to say the staff on the whole is

Giles '9B are the starters, with Dave

Lischer '97, Josh Roth '99, and new
addition Doug Rouse '9B coming out

So far, the Garnet Tide has gotten

Men's Lax Lives A Tale of Two Games
By

Pat

Donaghy

It was the best of times, it was the
worst of times. For the men's lacrosse team, this past weekend's Drew
Tournament was a tale of two games.
The Garnet began the tournament by

playing their best lacrosse of the season. But, the same Garnet finished by
losing in an embarrassing fashion,
leaving head coach Pat Gress questioning the desire of the team.
Saturday, the team faced the toughest team of the tournament, Tufts.
After spotting the Jumbos a 2-0 lead,
the Garnet came storming back. Pete
Hamilton '97 scored from a Pat
Donaghy '9B feed on a man up situation to put the Garnet on the board.
Soon after, Toby Patterson 'OO gave
a quick pass to Marcus Shin 'OO, who
bounced a shot to tie the game at two.
After a Tufts goal, Shin followed
with his second goal of the game to
end the first quarter at three.
While the offense stalled for the
next two quarters, the defense, led by
Tucker Zengerle 'OO, Nimish Dave
'99, Alex DeShields '9B, and Aaron
Hultgren '9B kept the Garnet in the
game, allowing only two goals over

Rosenbaum have all seen time in the
outfield. Rufus Frazer '99, who saw
action as a part time starter last season, started the first four games in
Florida but sustained an injury. He

the next two quarters. Hultgren was
named to the Centennial Conference
honorroll for his spectacular defense
throughout the tournament.
When Tuftsadded two fourth quarter goals with just six minutes left, it
appeared the 7-3 lead was insurmountable. However, the team rallied on the sidelines and vowed to
play until the final whistle. Donaghy
finally ended the scoring drought by
slicing through the defensefor a goal.
Just over a minute later, Matt
Halpern'9B used his speed to outrun
his defender and found the back of
the net to cut the lead to two.
With just over a minute left in the
game, the defense forced a turnover
and the Garnet controlled the ball.
Immediately,Donaghy found an open
Patterson on the crease, and thefreshman went airborne to swipe the ball
into the cage to cut the deficit to one.
Again, the defense forced a turnover
and the Garnet had a shot to go into
overtime. However, the Tufts goalie
made one ofhis 17 saves and time ran
out on the Garnet, as they dropped the
7-6 decision and played Drew in the
consolation game the next day.

on a bus in two days before the Sunday game and exhausted from the
lack of rest, the Garnet began the
consolation game flat. Adam
Dickinson 'OO dodged from behind
and scored the first goal of the game.
But the Garnet did not score for another fifty minutes.
With many offensive players injured, the Garnet could not control
the ball. Additionally, the hustle that
was prevalent just 24 hours before
could not be found. The team committed many mistakes and collected
unnecessary penalties. Defensively,
the Garnet broke down in the first
half as they fell to a 6-1 deficit.
In the second half, the Garnet
played their best defense of the season to date by allowing only two
goals, while consistently stripping
their Ranger counterparts. With the
starting midfieldunit all hurting, other
players were called upon to step up
their games. Dickinson and Erik
Johnson '9B played a solid second
half, as did Pete Karacki '9B, who
scored his first career goal in the
fourth quarter. But overall, the Garnet were never mentally intothe game
and they lost by a final score of 8-2.

Shenai '9B and Rani Shankar '9B.
The duo smashed their way to a close
8-6 win, showing off their great teamwork and cementing their second year
together as doubles partners. At second doubles was Michelle Martinez
'97 and Nga Lai '97. They rallied
strong and scored many great points
even though they have rarely played
together. However, they fell to
Ursinus (8-2) in the end.Third doubles
team

Rosenbaum '9B and

Wendy Kemp '99 fought tooth and
neck all theway, holding a tie throughout most of their match; yet in the
end, Ursinus triumphed by a 8-6 margin.
With the score at 2-1 Ursinus, the
six singles matches took the courts
by storm, and the first four single*
matches finished before sunset. First
singles playerMartinez madeher loss
at doubles no more than a distant
memory as she triumphed over her
Ursinus opponent 6-1, 6-4, while
Shenai at second singles not only
finished off her opponent the quickest, with a margin of 6-1, 6-1.
Both Shankar and Lai, at third and
fourth singles, fell to their Ursinus
opponents and brought the overall
score to 4-3, Ursinus, with only two
matches left in play: Rosenbaum's
and Kemp's at fifth and sixth singles.
Both teams and spectators were focused upon the two Swatties as they
battled their Ursinus opponents as
well as the oncoming darkness of
evening. Kemp finished soon after
by lobbing the advantage point over
her opponent's head, winning her
match 6-2,6-3 and setting the overall
score at a tie, 4-4. Rosenbaum, with
one set to her credit and one to her
opponent's, was stopped when her
third set reached 2-1, Swarthmore.
It became too dark to play outdoors, so the match was moved indoors. With Ursinus sitting in the
stands of fieldhouse and Swarthmore
along the sides, Rosenbaum and opponent Heather Williams played out
their set. Points lasted for up to three
minutes, with both players feeling
the pressure as the set determined the
overall winner. Rosenbaum's serves
were fast and hard, and she managed
to win two more games, but eventually fell to Williams with a narrow
score of 6-4. The team, encouraged
by their fighting spirit, will face
Western Maryland this afternoon and
Washington on Friday.

Picking up the Pieces
By

Jean Quinn

The softball team, 2-10 overall, 02 in the conference, picked up its
second win of the season last week,
but dropped key games to some midlevel teams whom they could have

beaten. The Garnet defeated Cabrini
12-9, although the close score does
not accurately reflect the team's abil-

ity. Wendy Lawrence '99 notched
her first win from the mound, filling
in for the injured Dana Lehman '9B.
Catcher Apryl Dunning '99 lauded
Lawrence, who "battled through some
really tough innings and still came
back to get thelast three outs. She
really showed a lot of grit and deter-

mination."
The team actually enjoyed a ten
run lead and should have ended the
game after five innings but Cabrini
held on and refused to fall quietly.
According to head coach Cheri
Goetcheus, the deciding factor in that
game was that "we executed both
offensively and defensively. We took
total control of the game from the
first pitch! We were able to work
with our signals offensively and
forced Cabrini to play defense."
Offensively, the Garnet proved to
have many strong bats and each inning added to their lead. Centerfielder Michelle Walsh' 98 continues
to lead the team from the plate, going
3 for 4, including a double and a
triple. She drove in 3 runs and scored
twice herself.
The Garnet hosted Drew University last Saturday for a doubleheader
and were routed both times, 11-2 and
23-12. Lawrence startedthe first game
and gave up 14 hits, but walked only
four batters. "We weren't prepared
to play in the first game. We got our
wake-up call about the 4th inning and
then it's difficult to play catch up,
especially because Drew had set their
pace and were confident," said
Goetcheus. Dunning singled and
doubled in that outing.
The team woke up in the second
game and found a new pitcher in
Rhiana Swartz 'OO. In her debut,
Schwartz did a good job and went the
distancefor the Garnet. Drew'spitchers were not overwhelming by any
means, but it took a long while for the
Garnet to find their offense. Facing

the possibility of having the game
called after five innings and being
down by more than eight runs, the
Garnet ran through the entire line-up
one inning and cut the Rangers' lead
to four runs. "Drew was able to answer back and we let them back in the
game with a couple of mental and
physical errors and we startedthrowing the ball around," said Goetcheus.
Drew scored 11 runs the next inning
and another attempt at a rally died
after the Garnet scored four runs, too
few to send the gameinto the seventh
inning. Only nine of Drew's runs
were earned. The Garnet has to improve their defense quickly and dramatically if they are to be a competitive team this season.
Walsh went 4 for 4 in the second
game, acquiring four doubles and
knocking in three runs. Two of her
shots hit the left-field fence and just
missed going out of the park, much to
everyone's dismay. Marybeth
Alvarez '9B and Jean Quinn '99 each
had two singles and a double and
combined for 3 RBIs. Dunning
notched a triple, and Schwartz scored
two runs off three singles.
The team lost its first conference
games against Washington College
this week, 6-3 and 10-0. Lehman returned to the mound and pitched all
but one inning of the two games.
Mental and physical errors plagued
the Garnet and were the difference
between victory and defeat. Only
three of the Shorewomen's 6 runs in
the first game were earned. In the
second game, the team could not find
their offense. Frustration in the field
worsened the outing.
One big factor affecting the team
was the lack of depth. The team had
no subs available and, with Lehman
not able to hit yet as a result of her
injured knee, could do nothing but try
to roll with the punches. Not helping
matters for the Garnet, many people
were forced to play positions which
they had not practiced. Swartz commented, "With the changes in the
lineup, it has been hard for everyone
to find their place on the team and in
the field. Everyone is adjusting well,
but it has been a factor in our fielding." The team will look to rebound
for a doubleheader at conference rival Gettysburg this Saturday.

Track & Field Prepares
for Haverford Meet
Swarthmore hopes to add another win to
Dixon's title winning season.

Ted Dixon was recently named the

1996-97 Mideast Region Women's
Indoor Track Coach of the year by
the United States Track Coaches Association.This is Dixon's fourth year
as a coach at Swarthmore, and his
third year as head coach of men' s and
women's cross country and indoor
and outdoor track teams.
Dixon led the women's indoortrack
team to a final 10-1 record and the
title ofCentennial Conference Championships during the winter season.
Dixon also traveled to Oshkosh, Wisconsin last month with automatic
national qualifier in the triple jump,
Catherine Laine '9B, to coach her
through the National NCAA Division 111 Competition.
The men's and women's track
teams are looking forward to an ex-

citing and successful outdoor season.
Their strength and potential was evident in the team's outstanding performance at the University of North
Carolina in the Wilmington Seahawk
Invitational over spring break. In addition to the effort put forth by the
entire team, DesireePeterkin 'OO stole
third place in the triple jump and
Mason Tootell '99 placed fifth in the
400 hurdles despite the fact that
Swat was the only Division 111 school
at the race competing with 29 Division I teams.
Swarthmore's outdoor track teams
are currently training for the
Haverford Five Way Meet, against
Haverford, Widener, Delaware Valley, and Ursinus this Saturday. Their
first home meet will be next weekend
in a six-way meet against Widener,
Allentown, Franklin & Marshall,
Salisbury State, and Jersey City.
