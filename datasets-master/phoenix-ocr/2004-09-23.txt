Construction delays WSRN launch date
As applications for DJ positions come in, managers still unsure of when station will be on the air
up for service," Flurie said.

BY REUBEN HEYMAN-KANTOR
rheymanl@swarthmore.edu
WSRN, Swarthmore's student-run radio
station, is still at least two weeks away
from broadcasting, general manager
Alexander Flurie 'O5 said. The station may
not be up and running until after fall

break.

Because of construction this year in
Parrish, WSRN was forced to move from its
former home on the fifth floor to the north
wing of the third floor, an inconvenience
that has led to the late start. The station is
usually on the air by the end of the second
week of classes during the fall.
"Part of [the responsibility for] this late
start is on our end, and part of this late
start is due to equipment that we are getting fitted for our new location," Flurie
said.

"We knew there would be
a delay, but we didn't
know how significant it
would be."
Alexander Flurie 'O5
While WSRN was able to move its
equipment and music collections into its

new location after dorm rooms were vacated in early June, the studio's managers are

still working to get things in order.
"I think over the summer there wasn't
as much moving and unpacking of the studio as we'd hoped to get done," WSRN
Treasurer Annie Fredrickson 'O7 said.
Along with the difficulties of moving,
WSRN has also been unable to get some of
its equipment in working order. "The company contracted to service our equipment
has not gotten back to us about picking it

Equipment
that requires repair
includes the mixing board, CD players, and
turntables and other items absolutely necessary for the station to go on air, Flurie
said.
The radio station will remain in its temporary location on Parrish Third throughout the 2004-2005 school year.
"We worked with them to identify an
acceptable temporary location last spring,"
Susan Sayer, the project manager in the
planning and construction department,
said.
The new space consists of four adjoining rooms, previously used for student

housing, and an office.

Some electrical work and wiring in the
new space was not completed until this
month, and work on the telephone system
is currently being completed.
"The electrical service [to the new
rooms] was completed in early September,"
Sayer said.
"The telephone work has been completed. However we finally on Friday, Sept. 17,
got the information that we need to provide
WSRN with the one software change that
they want to occur in their telephone service," Sayer added, referring to WSRN's
request to change its campus phone number.
"Eventually, WSRN will move back,"
Sayer said, adding that WSRN should
return to its former location on the fifth

floor of Parrish by next fall.
Despite the delays, WSRN decided to
hold its annual meeting for prospective
disc jockeys Sunday night. The meeting is
generally held before hiring is completed.
"It was just an informational meeting,
getting people's forms in, et cetera," blues
director Joseph Kille 'O6 said.
"We decided to just go ahead and have
the meeting because we didn't want freshmen not knowing where WSRN was, and
we wanted to get prospective DJs
involved," Flurie said.

Students offended by DU party theme, lobby for apology

"Professors and Schoolgirls."

found the theme to be highly
objectionable and sexist, particularly in its treatment of gender
roles, and thus unacceptable for

Mystery caller targets female students
Public Safety and ITS encounter obstacles in uncovering origin of suspicous voice
BY IVAN BOOTHE
iboothel@swarthmore.edu
Since the semester began, at
least 10 female students have

received early-morning phone
calls in which the caller, using a
deep, breathy voice, compliments

their appearance and then asks
them to continue the conversation from their beds.

"[The caller] asked if
I was in bed, and I
said no, I was standing up. He said to get
back in bed with the
phone."
Lissie Jaquette 'O7
Each call has followed the
same pattern:

they originated

from outside the campus phone

network, were placed before 7
a.m., and targeted female upperclassmen. Recipients of these
calls described the caller's voice

as male, though most said they
did not carry on the conversation for very long and were
unsure because they had just
woken up.
Lissie Jaquette 'O7 received a
call at 6:30 a.m. on Sept. 10. She
said the phone rang until her
voicemail picked up, and then

began ringing again.
"Someone was whispering my
name, over and over, and saying,

'you're so beautiful,'" Jaquette
said. "He asked if I was in bed,
and I said no, I was standing up.
He said to get back in bed with
the phone, and that's when I just

hung up."
Jaquette said she suspected
the caller had some knowledge of
the student body, because the
caller had referred to her as
"Lissie" rather than "Elisabeth,"
the name under which she is listed in the student directory.
Katharine Merow 'O6 had a
similar experience on Sept. 13.
"After my customary 'hello,' a
male voice breathed, 'I love you,
she said in an e-mail.
"When I didn't respond, the caller
persisted: 'Did I wake you?'"
SaUy HaU 'O6 did not let the
caller stay on for long. "When I
picked up, the person said, 'I love
you.' I said, 'Who are you?' I probably only let him get another four
words in before I hung up on
him," she said.
Most of the students called
baby,'"

Public Safety after receiving the
calls. Joanna Taylor 'O5 was one
of the first recipients of such a
call, on Aug. 31, the second day of
class, at 6:45 a.m. The Public
Safety officer who took Taylor's
report gave her the number of

Dumic,
Technology Services manager of
networking and systems. The
officer said Dumic would help

Taylor trace the call.
"I think it's a little funny they
gave me the number to call, as if
it's my responsibility to get my
phone calls tracked," she said.
"Especially when they said I
couldn't call before 9 a.m.
and
when I did call, no one was
there."

When Jaquette gave her
report, Public Safety instructed
her to call ITS as well. Three days
later, she still had not heard anything, so Jaquette called Public
Safety again.
"They didn't know what I was
talking about," she said. ITS was
also unfamiliar with the case,
and referred her back to Public
Safety.
"The guy who took my report

thought I was someone else
one of the [other] people to get the
call," Taylor said. "Nobody called

"He just kept saying
things like, 'Do you

applied to identify the caller by

both the college and our outside
phone provider," Redgrave said.
He did not elaborate.
Public Safety could not determine whether the call was placed
by a student or not, since a student could have placed the calls
from a pay phone or mobile
phone. Although the college's
ability to trace outside calls is not
consistent, Dumic said that cellular telephone companies would

said Public Safety had told them
others had received similar
calls.
"It would have been comforting if they had told me I was the
fourth person, that they were
looking into it," Jaquette said.
"To give me a sense that it wasn't
my own personal stalker. Instead
they sent me along in circles."
Hall said she "wouldn't expect
them" to release such information, in order to protect students'

privacy. Redgrave did not comment on whether this was the
reason Public Safety had not disclosed the prior calls.
Tara Miller 'O7, who received a
call just after 4 a.m. on Sept. 16,
said in an e-mail that though she
did not find it "serious or harassing," she thought that, "Given the
fact that other people received
calls, [Public Safety] should have

looked into it more than they
have."

Christina Procacci 'O6 was the
third recipient of a call, on Sept.
6. In her case, she said she was

operator was impolite.
"She asked me why I hadn't

Director of Public Safety
Owen Redgrave.said in an e-mail
that the college had been "unable
to trace the calls through the college's phone system, most likely

because the caller's phone is
'blocked.'"
Dumic said ITS was working

with Public Safety to trace the
calls, but that such information

depended on phone companies'
level of technology.
"Various methods are being

Redgrave did not comment on
whether Public Safety had considered issuing a safety notice
that would be posted around campus.
Tanya Nikiforova 'O7 received
a similar call before the end of

last semester, during finals period. "He just kept saying things
like, 'Do you know how beautiful
you are?'" she said. "He said, 'I
see you around on campus a lot.'"
Nikiforova said that when she
asked Public Safety if they could
trace the call, they said they
could not, but to inform them if
such a call occurred again. "They
weren't very receptive," she said.
Dumic said that "there was
some confusion" about what students should do in the event of a

suspicious call, and whether it
would be handled by ITS or
Public Safety.

Several female students have received suspicious early morning
phone calls since the beginning of the year.
"Owen [Redgrave] and I are
having discussions about the
process right now," he said.
Currently, ITS does not have a

permanent telecom administrator. The previous manager left at
the beginning of the semester,
and a replacement has not been
found.
Craig said the police department would only trace a call in
the event of a "specific threat or
danger," "specific criminal activity," or if the victim suspects a
particular individual or phone
number. He said a person could
press *57 in order to alert the
phone company that there has
been a suspicious call.
As more people dial this number, a pattern will develop, which
would help police if they subpoena phone records for the number.
Dumic, however, said that this
would not work on campus

phones.
"Our phone system is now 12
to 13 years old, and some of the

features mandated for new systems by the FCC in the last couple
of years are not yet implemented," he said in an e-mail. He said
a new phone system was at least a
year and a half away.
"The standard method to
address an unwanted call is to

versation,"

"Document the date and time and

promptly report the incident to
Public Safety."
Taylor said she received a second early morning call at 6:30
a.m. two weeks after the first
incident, but she did not answer
the phone. She reported the second incident and said Redgrave
thanked her and told her that

Public Safety was continuing to
look into the problem but did not
provide any specifics.
Genevra Pittman 'OB received

a suspicious call, but it did not fit
the pattern of the other calls. It
was placed from the phone of
Ryan Hammond 'O7. The person

who left the message told her he

was "going around randomly
calling people, looking for a sexy
voice."
Unlike the other incidents, the
call was made from on campus

and in the middle of the day.
Additionally, the caller left a message, and none of the other students were first-years.
Hammond said he had not
placed the call. "I'm going to ask
around about it, but I don't know
anything," he said. "It definitely
was not me."

Sound system damaged at Phi Psi party
SAC will have to fund rental of outside sound equipment until unit is repaired
BY BEN OLDFIELD

boldfiel@swarthmore.edu

The college's only portable sound syswas significantly damaged on
Saturday, Sep. 11 during a Student
Activities Committee funded party at Phi
tem

Psi fraternity.
Luckily for those attending the party,
Olde Club Technical Director Dave
McCandlish 'O5 was immediately notified
of the malfunction.
McCandlish arrived shortly thereafter
to make temporary adjustments to the
system.
His modifications allowed the system
to continue operating, though at a lower

quality.
A beverage was spilled on the system
and liquid had inundated the faders of the
audio mixer and CD player, according to

McCandlish.

Although the system continued working, the damage is permanent and will
need professional attention.
"Several faders will need to be replaced
by a professional technician," he said.
Rattech director Shalaj Tater 'O6

believes these repairs will be completed
by the weekend of Oct. L
It is unclear how much the repairs will
cost, because, though McCandlish has
already surveyed the damage himself, the
system still has to be sent out to a professional outlet to get an official estimate on
the cost of repairs.
Those who hoped to use the portable
system will now need to request funding
from SAC to rent another system from a
sound company.

The portable system has not yet been
requested by anyone for this weekend,
according to Tater.
But, SAC paid $2OO for the rental of a
system for last Saturday's party at the
Delta Upsilon lodge, according to Student
Budget Committee Director Sonya Hoo
'O5.

According to Hoo, Rattech has its own

upkeep of the portable system and the permanent system in Paces.

son who did it, the fraternity is responsible."
The responsibility will not be placed
on anyone until the damage is more thoroughly assessed.
The last major damage to occur to the
college's sound equipment was at last
year's
Swarthmore Queer Union's
Metamorphosis party when the lock on
the permanent system in Paces was broken, The Phoenix reported.
McCandlish and Tater expressed frustration with the poor treatment of the college's sound systems.
"I'd like to urge people to be careful
with their drinks," McCandlish said.
"This is expensive equipment and accidents like this greatly reduce its lifetime.

Hoo is frustrated that the damage to
the Rattech system has put the financial

burden on SAC.
"SAC shouldn't have to [fund the rental
of another system]," she said. "That was
$2OO down the drain," that cannot be used
for future parties, she added.
Representatives of Rattech and SBC

said.

"If Phi Psi can't find the specific per-

repairs of the system.

It's an issue of respect for other students,"
But, this budget will be insufficient to
make the necessary repairs for the recent
damage, she said.
"In this case, since we know where and
when it happened, we're able to hold
someone responsible for the damage," she

he added.
Tater agreed. "We should be grateful
that the college supplies us with this

equipment for our entertainment," he

said.
"We can't afford renting systems from
outside," Tater said.

Student Council will hold a run-off election this week for

The “margin of error is the difference between the total

In this election, the margin of error was 43 votes while the
differencebetween the two candidates was 18 votes.
Gupta said the margin of error was so high because of
confusion of whether students had voted twice.
“Usually before we begin table voting, we cross off people who voted online,” Gupta said. However, the council

The lectures begin at 4:15 p.m. in the
Scheuer Room with Pulitzer Prizewinning writer and historian John Dower.
Dower specializes in modern Japan
and relations between Japan and the
United States. "He is known for his study
of Yoshida Shigeru, who was Prime
Minister of Japan during the U.S. occupation of Japan, and [he] then wrote 'War
without Mercy,' which is a staple in many
history classes," sociology and anthropology professor Aya Ezawa said.
"War without Mercy" won the National
Book Critics Circle Award. "Embracing
Defeat," Dower's most recent book, will
form the basis for his talk tonight.
The book focuses on the experiences of
the Japanese from 1945 to 1952 during the
American occupation of Japan.
"It is written from the perspective of
the conquered without victimizing them,"
Ewaza said. "There was no food for three
years, so there was a huge black market.
The children would play games like 'black
market' and 'war crimes tribunal.' His
book portrays what day-to-day life was

like under U.S. occupation."
"We came up with the idea for this lecture
because war and occupation in

was a big issue," Ezawa said. "When
the invasion started, people in the Bush

Japan, so we thought it would make for a

relevant lecture series."

under slavery and during Reconstruction
in detail," history professor Pieter Judson
said. "His histories have caused us to com-

pletely reassess what Southern society
actually

looked like."

Dower feels that such comparisons are
faulty. "When war had ended, the U.S.-

dominated occupation of Japan had moral
as well as legal legitimacy in the eyes of
the rest of the world. There was a level of
unequivocal regional and global support
that a projected U.S. war against Saddam
Hussein does not enjoy. The occupation
also had legitimacy in the eyes of almost
all Japanese," Dower wrote in his article
"After Saddam," published in The
Guardian.
Ezawa expressed a hope that the lecture will lead to a greater understanding
about Japan and Asia among students.
"Asia shouldn't be a place that is fun
because of the Geisha and Samurai but a
useful tool for historical comparison," she

said.

Fellow Pulitzer Prize winner Steven
Hahn will take the stage at 7:30 p.m. in the
Scheuer Room.
Hahn won the Pulitzer last year for his
book, "A Nation Under Our Feet: Black
Political Struggles in the Rural South
from Slavery to the Great Migration."
Tonight, he will speak at Swarthmore
about slave rebellion.
"Hahn is one of the first historians to
really examine daily life in the South both

schools and diverse communities.
"He is a wonderful teacher who is com-

mitted to bringing access to ideas to students in all kinds of institutions," Judson
said. "Since he is a master teacher, we

The timing of the two talks was accidental. "They were both planned for early
in the year, so no one checked to see what

Much of Hahn's recent work includes
discussion of networks and associations
between slaves, based on work, religion or
kinship, The New York Times reported.
He studies the ways in which slaves were
actors in emancipation and disunion
before the North even became involved in
the war. He also calls upon scholars to
expand traditional definitions of what
political means.

In addition to being a historian, Hahn

Pieter Judson said in an e-mail. "We're

Dower's talk was funded by the
President's Office, the history, sociology

and anthropology and

Japanese departments and the peace and conflict studies

and Asian studies programs, Ezawa said.
It is the first in a planned lecture series
about war and occupation in East Asia.
The sponsors for Dower's talk are sponsoring the other speakers in this series,
according to Ezawa.

Hahn's talk was co-sponsored by the

Storage sale to be held this Sunday
The Student Council, in conjunction with resident assistants, will be holding
a storage sale on Parrish Beach this Sunday from 1-4 p.m., Student Events
Advisor Myra Vallianos ’05 said in an e-mail.
“We were frustrated with all the stuff that stays in storage for years and
wanted to clean out the space so that we could more efficiently utilize that
space,” she said.
Mary Lyon will be holding its own storage sale at 3 p.m. on Sunday. “We
checked out the storage and it seemed like there wasn’t that much to sell,”
ML RA Wee Chua ’06 said. The ML RAs decided that it would not be worth the
effort to bring the small number of items to the Parrish Beach storage sale
and decided to have their own sale, Chua said.
The council and college RAs are exploring the possibility of giving the proceeds to the ABC House, which houses highly motivated students who live
with difficult social or economic circumstances in locally-run ABC programs
that aim to give the students better educational opportunities, Vallianos said.

The new poll will include revisions, representing the group's

Reeves acknowledged that
these complaints were "fair critiques" and Fiedler said he hopes

recreating a broad survey.

Alexis Reedy 'O5 was skeptical

Qüb spurns profit for
community atmosphere
BY RICHARD Mill

rmuil@swarthmore.edu
After four semesters of bringing in low profits, Qiib, Swarthmore's student-run Asian cafe,
started off the semester with
changes to its financial management plan and menu.

"The original intention of

the [Qiib] founding members
was to turn a profit and to ultimately create other Qiib franchises elsewhere," manager
Alex Braunstein 'O5 said.
Rather than striving to generate profit, this semester's Qiib
managers look to further integrate the cafe into campus life.
"The management has com-

pletely changed from a business
pursuit to becoming a social
outlet, which I don't think there

are enough of on campus,"
Braunstein said.
As a part of its revised purpose, Qiib will be working with
student groups, offering their
space as a resource for those on
campus working toward community service and social justice initiatives. Planned events
include collaborative efforts
with Amnesty International as
well as Cookies for Charity, in
which these groups will host
events to solicit support for
their respective initiatives.
Qiib is offering new menu

items this semester, including
chai, fried rice, brown rice,

Last Thursday, Qiib's opening drew in at least 200 students,
manager Waverly Lutz 'O5 said.
Angie Contrero 'O7 felt that
the Qiib atmosphere provided a
better atmosphere than Pub

because it is well lit, aesthetical-

ly pleasing, reasonably priced,
and has a very chill atmosphere," she said. "There are

Seeking cash and glory at the poker table
BY ALYSSA WORK

aworkl@swarthmore.edu
It's after midnight. Silence fills a darkened room as hardened gamblers peer over racks of cards, trying hard to decipher their opponents' every glance. A stack of chips sits in
the center of the table, waiting to be claimed.
Atlantic City? A Texas saloon? No, it's the poker scene,
right here at Swarthmore. Nightly games in dorm lounges

and weekly student tournaments are gaining popularity onand off-campus, and more and more students are anteing up.
"It's a competitive game," said Joshua Berney 'O5, who
frequently plays poker on campus with a group of six to
eight friends. "People like competition, and there's the possibility of winning decent amounts of money."
Alfred Shon 'O5 attributes the game's popularity to its
accessibility.
"Anybody can play

it's an intellectual game," said
Shon, who won (but has not yet received) a $lOO gift certifi...

cate at Saloon Night during orientation week. "I've never

read books because I wanted to master the game on my own
hands. But there's a lot of psychology involved in gambling

strategy."

students have noticed a rise in the number of students playing poker this year, a trend that has ESPN to
thank. Shows like "World Poker Tour" and "Celebrity
Poker" are bringing the game out from its smoky back-room
origins and into the living rooms and hall lounges of the
Many

mainstream.
Students typically gather in dorms, empty lounges, or
down at Qiib in groups of five to eight to play Texas Hold

'Em, the most widely known variation of the game.
Players believe that Hold 'Em is the version of poker
where luck and skill are most evenly balanced
where luck
will still affect the game, but where skill is essential for any
substantial wins.
"Since more inexperienced players know it, you can win
more playing against inexperienced people," Berney said.
Hold 'Em is the game to be played at the campus poker
tournaments held in Mephistos each week. Organized by
Anders Taylor 'O7 and Jeff
Schneider 'O5, the tournaments will be hosted
"Fridays and Saturdays
when there's not much
going on," Taylor said.
"We'll have a bunch of
different buy-ins," Taylor
said, "and all the money
i taken off the top will be

tournament by the peo\

bout 30 people at a $1 regis(.ration fee and $5 buy-in.
Taylor said the e-mail list has about 50 players, but he
"hopes it will grow as people hear about it." Although the
last tournament was completely male, Taylor said he was
surprised and would like to see more girls playing.

'

The buy-in for next week's tournament is expected to be
higher, between $lO and $2O. This may be considerably higher than most students are used to playing for on campus.
"Unfortunately, we play for zilch ... there's nothing to be
won except pride," Shon said about his nightly Wharton

matches.
Online poker, however, offers the opportunity for higher
stakes and more anonymous play. Internet matches are
"really increasing in popularity," Berney said. "Relatively

intelligent people can make serious money online."
"People play higher stakes than when they're with
friends," said Taylor, who plays online about once a week. "I
guess you feel more justified taking money from people you

don't know."
Games and tournaments go on all year for most students
devoted to the game, and experienced players know what it
takes to win. Veterans cite a willingness to take risks as one
of the most vital qualities for a serious poker player to have.
Winning requires a combination of both knowledge about
the game and an ability to read your fellow players and figure out what they're thinking.
"It's a complex game ... there's a lot of skill involved,"
Taylor said. "Anything people call luck is odds of the hand,

and it depends what you do with it."

"There are swings of luck," Taylor said. "It's like playing
any other game, except with stakes."
And in the end, he said, "it's nice to have a little extra
income."

When we weren't slamming our Barbie

castration had deprived him of any secondary sexual characteristics such as a deep
voice or body hair. Underneath his neonpink windbreaker, the Mattel man had a
chest as smooth as Barbie's. It was the first
exposure (for us and for many other cruel,
overly-sexed children) to a peculiar cultural
contradiction: Body hair, whether it's
skimpy or a full hirsute, is the one outfit you

In 2002, this hegemony of hairlessness

you have it, you might as well embrace it,
and shape it into stylish mustaches."
Thus edified, we decided to conduct
our own informal poll regarding body

we bullied a number of confused freshmen into answering a vague survey and
then forgot what they said. Our amazing

professor
Googley McGoogle, our obsession with
body hair is not a modern phenomenon.
Grecian women, circa 400 8.C., removed
leg hair by burning it off with a lamp.
Queen Elizabeth I removed all hair from
her face and forehead (you're not the only
one!), a trend that eventually caught on in
the aristocracy. By the 1700s, well-to-do
men were shaving off their eyebrows and
substituting them with chic mouse skin
press-ons, the Enlightenment's equivalent
of a Fendi bag: expensive, unnecessary,
and made out of a rodent.
More athletic fashions, combined with
a wartime fabric shortage, led to the short
hemlines and bare arms of the 19205.
Razor companies capitalized on these
trends and launched a campaign to convince women that body hair was unattractive and unfeminine. A 1924 issue of
"Neet" magazine ran the text of the following ad: "Perhaps, because of an oldfashioned scruple, you have hesitated to
rid yourself of the disfigurement of
underarm hair. Are your arms constantly
pinned to your sides? Or do you scorn to
wear the filmy or sleeveless frocks that
the vogue of the day decrees? In either
case, "He" is apt to think you lifeless and
behind the times. "He" will notice you
holding yourself aloof from the swing of
convention." The editors of "Neet" were
not available for comment on the ad,
chiefly because they are dead. Maybe
"He" killed them. We don't know. But
that's not to say that men were exempt
from the vogue of the day. The fickle

To a man who touched so many hearts

Andre' Na Dell Singleton: 1954-2004

community," Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6l

BY ORIANA GALARDI-ESTE
ogalardl@swarthmore.edu
Andre' Na Dell Singleton passed away on
Thursday, May 27 of a heart attack. He was 50 years
old and had been an

integral and loved member of the
Sharpies dining staff for nine years. After working a
number of positions, he was promoted to Dining
Assistant 111 and was primarily responsible for the
beverage section.
Many remember him fondly for the candy he dispensed and the fruit juice drinks he mixed, "the wonderful beverages that always included a little love,"
Sharpies Multi-tasker Anne Dortone said. He was "the
best beverage guy I've ever seen," Dishroom
Supervisor Brett Day said. "Every time the kids came
in, they looked for him."
News of Andre"s death reverberated throughout
the Swarthmore community, reflecting the widespread impact that he had in his years working on
campus. "Every time I have walked into the dining
hall since his passing, I have been hit with a gigantic
wave of sadness," Vice President Larry Schall '75 said.
"There's a hole in Sharpies where a smiling face is
missing," Manager Theresa Hopson said.
Those who knew Andre' spoke of his warmth and
selflessness. "Andre' was the reason people enjoyed
Swarthmore cafeteria," Director of Dining Services
Linda McDougall said. Many said that he was the most
comforting aspect of Sharpies, with a smile constantly
plastered across his face. "If you walked in the door
feeling sick or sad, he would somehow make you
laugh.... And he had a nickname for everyone. Andre'
was the epitome of an all-around great guy," Day said.
Others considered Andre a surrogate family member. "Andre' was the big brother I never had," Checker
Yvette Johnson said.
Andre"s influence was felt far beyond his position
at the dining hall. He served on the Spring Fling
Committee every year and participated in the early
days of the Learning for Life program. He also served
on the President's Ad Hoc Living Wage Committee.
"He had a special gift for making you feel part of a

said. "I miss him."
Andre Jr., one of Andre's three children, recalled
last year's Rhythm 'N Motion concert, which Andre'
attended to watch his son's performance. "He was so
happy that he could give back to the community"
through Andre Jr.'s participation in the concert,
Andre Jr. said.
"He was a rare gift among us," McDougall said, "a
gentle soul who truly cared about people and their
well-being
generous beyond reproach, always giv...

ing and asking nothing in return."
Andre' is missed dearly and will continue to be
missed in the hearts of those that he touched. "Andre
has become a legacy here at Swarthmore," Johnson

said.

"Always a smile on his face and

a special drink in his hand
that was Andre."

Services were held on Wednesday, June 2 at the
Victory Temple AME Church in East Lansdowne.
Andre' now rests at Haven Memorial Cemetery in
Chester Township. Dining Services is planning a
memorial service for the fall, when a tree or bench
will be installed on campus in Andre"s name. The
Swarthmore community will be notified when the
plans are finalized.
Condolence cards may be sent to Andre"s wife
Vanessa Singleton at 7019 Atlantic Ave., Upper Darby,

said that they would like to thank the Swarthmore
community for supporting the Singleton family in

their time of need.

seemed pretty natural to pass by and say hello, or at least

his obvious discomfort and asked what
was wrong. When

She had experienced the same exact thing earlier that

Suddenly, we realized we had both been victims of the
Swarthmore "No Hello" Policy.
Many Swarthmore students endorse the "No Hello"

Policy. It's something that has been ingrained from ori-

entation, a delicate piece of decorum by which Swatties
unconsciously abide. Even though we live on such a
small campus, where you inevitably see the same people
every day, an "introduction barrier" still exists. This

barrier prevents you from starting a conversation with
people you have not been introduced to, even if you see
them almost every day. Until a happenstance incident
when you're finally introduced, or a mutual friend introduces you, you're firmly stuck in the realm of the "no
hello."
We suggest that you act boldly: Force the hello by
yelling it out, or the next time you see the person, introduce yourself! Voila! The introduction barrier has been
overcome!
But how does this explain the case where Etan knew
the person fairly well, and still she avoided him? All he
had wanted was a hello to brighten his day. Unless he

MOVIE REVIEW

More cheer at
Nair's 'Vanity Fair'
BY MATT TOM
mtoml@swarthmore.edu
The Novel Without a Hero: Yep, that's "Vanity Fair," all
right. Judging by the repugnant viciousness of just about
every character, rich and poor, in Thackeray's sprawling,
wonderfully acidic take on the British elite, a more fitting
description for the novel may be "The Novel With One Too
Many Evil Bastards." The director, Mira Nair, gets a lot of
things right in condensing the classic novel into about two
and a half hours but, naturally, she imbues her film version
with some modern sensibilities that will probably displease
English majors who like the film versions of their favorite
books translated tit-for-tat onscreen. Everybody else should
be happy with Nair's tinkering; without it, we'd all be leaving
the theater with a serious need to reinforce the idea that there
is some good in all of us.
Born the impoverished daughter of an artist and a French
opera girl, Becky Sharpe (Reese Witherspoon) decides to claw
her way up the social ladder using her sardonic wit and considerable sex appeal. After leaving her orphanage, Becky
takes on the position of governess for the children of a scraggly, bearded Sir Pitt (Bob Hoskins) who just happens to be the
brother of Matilda Crawley (Eileen Atkins), the extremely
wealthy, disagreeable matriarch of the family. Upon visiting
Sir Pitt for a getaway, Matilda takes an immediate liking to
Becky. Of course, a love story has to be embedded somewhere
in the mix, and it comes in the form of Rawdon Pitt (James
Purefoy), a soldier who also happens to be Sir Pitt's son and
Matilda Crawley's favorite nephew. Though Becky is attracted less to his charm than his prestige and his piggy bank, he
likes her for less superficial reasons (although her looks are
certainly a plus). Their subsequent marriage rockets her into
the front ranks of high society, a place she holds for only a
brief period of time; Aunt Crawley writes Rawdon out of her
will in a hurry upon learning of his marriage. Becky is a
witty, seemingly cultured girl, but you just can't buy class.
Lurking behind the prim and proper niceties of the British
aristocracy are some pretty nasty waters which, in the end,
pretty much swallow Becky whole.
Still, Becky is certainly not a heroine and much of her downfall is the result of her own scheming and manipulation. She is
simply a piece of fabric woven into the rotten underside of a
classist society. Reese Witherspoon does a fine job of portraying
Becky's devious nature, but it's hard not to sympathize with her
just a little. Nair has intentionally structured the story away
from the core of Becky's selfish desires and instead emphasizes
the context in which Becky finds herself. Hence, Becky's social
climbing is more a result of her desire to escape from her lowly
origins and less about her corrupt, vixenish nature. Many people will probably complain about this deviation from the novel,
but I found it rather pleasant to see someone onscreen with a
heart that was a shade lighter than pitch black. Of course, part
of Thackeray's whole point was that, at least in his society,
everyone was pretty much scum, but in this day and age I don't
have to be reminded of the cruelties of human nature. Besides,

Nair keeps Becky devilish enough to not exactly warrant tears

when her life spirals out of control.
The main problem in translating "Vanity Fair" to the big
screen comes in juggling the multiple plot lines, and this is
where the movie falters most. One plot line that probably could
have been axed involves Becky's best, or most useful, friend,
Amelia Sedley (Romola Garai), a newly impoverished nice girl
who is desperately in love with the wealthy soldier George
Osborne (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), and George Dobbin (Rhys
Ifans), the soldier who secretly pines for Amelia. It pretty much
amounts to a shallow amalgam of hum-drum romantic yearnings and selfish motives with too little emphasis on developing
these characters. Gabriel Byrne is good as the Marquess of
Steyne, a wealthy cad who helps out Becky and Rawdon with
their financial troubles only so that he can get hot and wild with
Becky later on.
Nair spices up the stiffness of this very structured society by
drenching the screen in color, with costumes that are extravagantly bold and lavish. She also adds a number of Indian influences to the narrative, most notably a rather ludicrous
Bollywood dance number performed by Witherspoon and company for King George IV. Still, it adds a certain vitality to the
depressing cloud of angst that seems to pervade Thackeray's
duplicitous world. Nair has made this world her own, but she's
made sure to give credit where credit is due. I don't think
Thackeray would have been displeased with her effort.

Surviving the perils of breaking up
Late last month
I found myself suddenly thrown into
the cesspool of the
Newly Single for
the first time in
two years. I listened to friends
assure me, in the
way that friends
pretty much have
to, that I had to be
patient, that I was
an attractive and
interesting person
SARAH WALSH
and certainly not
an Unfunny Pale
Sex and the Swattie
Girl, and that I
would indeed find
love (or at least lust
that lasted through a box of condoms) again. I looked
to my grandma for further unconditional support.
"You're so pale. How are you so pale?" she demand.
ed when I brushed her queries about my love life aside.
She shook her head sadly. "And 125 pounds? I didn't
weigh that much when I was pregnant. With twins. At
36."
Bolstered by this vote of confidence, I told myself
what my therapist told me to tell myself, which is,
"Sarah, you are a worthwhile person. What Swattie
wouldn't want to date you?" You're probably all very
taken aback, but apparently not too many. Right then,
I knew I needed to change the direction of my personal life
loneliness forever or (cue choir music)
Internet dating. And since my vibrator was out of batteries and I was too lazy to replace them, I knew God
was sending me a message.
Internet dating, once only the domain of Very
Very Desperate Losers, is quickly morphing into a
common part of the cyberspace experience (no, really,
I'm really not desperate at all). It ended up being a
good fit for me, since I'm too emotional for casual sex
and can't hold my liquor enough for witty bar room
repartee. Also, as one of my recent detractors so
bluntly pointed out on the Daily Jolt, my backside is
far from rock-hard and, shockingly, not everyone who
ever lays eyes on me finds me attractive. (Honestly,
guys, you don't need to exert the obvious effort you
put into belittling my body or lack of talent. I'm
already awesome at it.)
The Internet dating site I chose (one similar to
Match.com) seems to have offered a solution to all of
these personal flaws, since it requires all members to

September 23, 2004

fill out detailed personality and interest questionaires
and then sends you prospective matches based on
these criteria. Part of the reason I chose this particular
site was that I found their theory of compatibility
intriguing
basically that someone as emotional and
impulsive as I am would be better off with someone a
bit more, shall we say, stable. (This appealed to me,
since in my last relationship a typical conversation
would go like this: Him: Pass the ketchup. Me: We're
out. Him: God, why can't you be better in bed?!)
It turned out that my "personality profile" was
frighteningly accurate
it even advised any potential
matches who read it that they should "be prepared to
hear lots of stories." Ouch. To be honest, initially it
was addictive to have so many virtual dates paraded
before me after being out of the game for so long.
However, I quickly learned that finding someone I was
interested in enough to risk First Date Horror with
was tough. Of course, I had expected ridiculous profile
quotes like, "I just want to find that special someone to
see stars at the top of a mountain with." What I hadn't
expected was how many people a) resembled fortyyear-old Budweiser devotees at 24 and b) do not read,
anything, at all, ever.
After a couple of weeks, I did correspond with
someone whom I desired to meet in person, but I was a
little suspicious. His picture was actually attractive,
he was a fan of Neutral Milk Hotel and Adult Swim,
and he didn't include "burning stuff' in his list of hobbies. Plus, he loved Guiness, so clearly he valued the
cultural achievements of my people.
I half-expected to be stuffed into a trunk as I waited
on the corner of 17th and JFK, but was pleasantly surprised find out that he did resemble his picture, kept
me laughing the entire night, and promised to wait
until at least the third date before sending me to swim
with the fishes. That was a few weeks ago, and apart
from forcing ourselves to awkwardly laugh during
commercials of the online dating site that brought us
together, it's been a blast. As much as I loathe sounding like a spokesperson for one of these sites, it's a little frightening how compatible we are. From
Futurama to Northern Exposure, we have virtually
the same taste, as well as the same (sometimes pathetic) sense ofhumor.
It was especially nice to have someone to vent to
after the sting of the aforementioned Jolt posts this
weekend, someone who appreciates my flawed ass as
is, or at least, seems reasonably convincing in his
appreciation. What more, I ask you, can a slutty-dressing, sub-par sex columnist from the suburbs ask for?

THE PHOENIX

For this
group of women
was bonding, uniting, joining together into an amalgamation of raw female understanding. I sat and felt
awkward. Occasionally I'd give a kind look or a nod
or tryvery, very hard to spontaneously grow a vagina so I could better appreciate the beautiful and
wondrous female experience. But mostly I sat and
although I
thought, "Why is it I'm here again?"
knew very well it was all because of the sign.
It's an embarrassing story in a way. Finding
groups through Sharpies signs is like finding dates
through personal ads. No well-unadjusted Swattie
stops to read the advertisements en route to lunch.
Extreme amounts of color and glitter might warrant
a brief glance, but no one reads signs seriously.
Except this sign drew me in. It spoke to me. It
seemed to know exactly who I was. I quote, "DO YOU
LIKE WOMEN? WE DO. JOIN FEMINIST MAJORITY." Now here was an intriguing idea, a club for
and not
women-lovers. I certainly like women
only in the standard, crude, heteroerotic sense. How
could I not fit in with this group? Their meeting was
Monday night at 10 p.m., smack dab in the middle of
Monday night football, of course. Still, I had no
choice but to attend.
I arrived at Kohlberg at 10 p.m. sharp, ready
for a night full of feminist fun. Secretary Micaela
Baranello 'O7, clad proudly in her "This Is What a
Feminist Looks Like" T-shirt, was the first to welcome me. Her initial elation at my presence
waned, though, when she learned I was Phoenix
staff. "We have a bit of a problem recruiting
guys," she said, and she feared I wasn't truly
interested in joining. However, she still offered
me some of the delectable homemade brownies
she'd baked. They were absolutely delightful.
Somewhere in the depths of her closet, she must

September 23, 2004

have a "This Is What a Domestic Goddess Looks
Like" T-shirt too.
Finishing the brownies, I took a seat, pausing to
grab a pair of fact sheets on international reproductive rights. Printed on aesthetically pleasing pink
and purple paper, they were as colorful as they were
informative. The meeting was called to order with
the standard name-and-class-year introductions. Of
the 19 of us, there were no seniors, a very few juniors, and only a single "first-year." There were, however, eight self-described "freshmen" who openly
denied the administration's rigidly imposed class
nomenclature. Even more striking, though, was
this: There were 18 women in the room and no other
males. I gathered this even before the introductions
of all the Sarahs and Emilys, observant reporter that
I am. Micaela hadn't been exaggerating.
After the introductions, presidents Sarah
Cotcamp 'O7 and AUie Hartry 'O7 gave an overview of
the group. They are a local branch of a national
organization, which means "it's pretty easy for
[them] to get money." However, their specific agenda
is theirs alone to decide. The eager freshfolk had a
multitude of ideas. Stage the Vagina Monologues!
Offer self-defense classes! Make care packages for
women in shelters! The room was awash in creative
fervor, despite the presidents' repeated mentions
that they'd done all these things already.
The idea of a body image workshop, however,
was controversial enough to stir some feminists'
passions. Could they do such a thing without being
insensitive or offensive? Would people in need gain
helpful advice? Should they extend it to discuss male
body image too? In the end, there was only assent on
this last point. For what sort of Feminist Majority
would they be if they didn't deal with male issues

too?
Of course, I couldn't help but wonder who would
put such a thing together. It seemed like male minds
might have some relevant thoughts about male bodies. Micaela was right; this group needed an injection of some savvy, activist, feminism-minded
testosterone. Part of me wanted to return, but I knew
this was more than I could handle myself. Instead, I
have a request: Men of Swarthmore, take an hour of
your time. Join the Feminist Majority. Aid their
plans for a sports bra fundraiser (still percolating in

the plans, but who can't get excited about bras proclaiming that Swarthmore supports women?). Help
them construct [reserved-female] e-mails (yes, such
a thing exists). If I can get 20 men to join, I'll even
return myself. So sign up! Tell me of your plans! If
nothing else, you'll get a lot of tasty brownies.

Phone fears
Although Swarthmore College has many priorities to
juggle, it seems to us that its responsibility for the security of its students should hold a non-negotiable spot at
the top of the list. Even in our information-saturated age
ofe-mail and cell phones, people have a basic right to be
protected from harassment and invasion of privacy.
So we find it disappointing that the school's response
to the recent rash of phone harassment has apparently
been to make discreet inquiries to phone companies,
blandly reassure students and otherwise say and do nothing. The

fact that these calls have recurred so many times

to so many people, with the same pattern of behavior
each time, shows that this probably isn't just a random,
ill-considered attempt to get a cheap laugh. Whatever this
person's complete motivations may be, he's exploiting a
cheap and easy method of making women feel uncom-

fortable and violated. That is the kind of behavior we
must not tolerate, especially if he's a student here.
So why haven't we done more to catch him? Of course
ITS and Public Safety now claim to be working on the
problem with phone companies, and we're giving them
the benefit of the doubt. We have no choice but to do so,
since they're not giving us any more information.
As usual, it isn't the good intentions of the authorities
we're questioning, but the efficiency and transparency of
their process. Why weren't the students who sent in
complaints kept informed about the progress of the investigation? That makes a great deal of difference when a
student's feeling threatened by an anonymous harasser.
Along the same lines, why weren't students kept adequately informed about the scope of the investigation?
Given that it's the students' personal safety that may be
in question, it seems they have a right to know about how
many other students are involved and how big the problem might be. True, there is a legitimate privacy issue
involved. However, several students have chosen to
speak to The Phoenix to inform the public of the situation
and warn them about communicating with this crank
caller. It seems like Public Safety should have presented
disclosure as an option to the students involved rather
than taking the decision upon themselves to keep quiet.
There are other issues, like the lack of a *57 harassment reporting feature on our phone network that makes
our campus an attractive target for harassment.
However, the main issue is Public Safety's apparent slow-

ness to react to this situation, and their unwillingness to
publicize details students ought to know.
A phone harasser's sense of safety comes from secrecy; the most effective way to combat this harasser seems
to us to be to launch an organized, coordinated and
public effort to find him. This kind of low-key, hesitant
response will only embolden and encourage possible
copycats in the future.

SAC sponsors sleazy stereotyping
Dear Editor:
We are writing to express our disappointment with SAC's
decision to fund Saturday's "Professors and Schoolgirls"
party. The intention behind the theme, as stated explicitly in
the weekly SAC e-mail, was that men and women would
dress up to play their respective parts. Thus, Swarthmore's
student body was asked to assume particular gender roles
men were to be the powerful and intellectually superior professors, while women were to take the role of the powerless,
sexually vulnerable and intellectually inferior schoolgirls.
Honestly, it might as well have been called "Pimps and Hos,"
since the implied dynamic would have been the same.
The "Professors and Schoolgirls" theme is antithetical to
the basic precepts of the community we have built here at
Swarthmore. Far from reinforcing sexual and gender roles,
we've tried to accept a broad range of identities and
lifestyles. We've tried to create an environment in which stu-

dents are never asked to enact uncomfortable stereotypes.
Still more objectionable than the theme itself was its official endorsement (and funding) from SAC. A key part of
SAC's mandate is to judge whether a proposal is appropriate, taking into consideration the standards of mutual
respect we demand as a community. But SAC funding also
gives an event a type of collectively bestowed legitimacy. So
when SAC endorsed the theme, that was Student Council
endorsing the theme, and, by extension, you and I.
Synopsis: A group of male students proposed a theme
that would say to female students, "We're throwing a party
with your money. If you want to come, it's expected that you
dress up as a stereotype you may find distasteful and belit-

tling, but that guys get off on." Then SAC said, "OK." What's
wrong with this situation?

Reach of evil SCCS conspiracy exaggerated
Dear Editor:
Allow me to introduce myself. I was
the SCCS president in the fall of 2000,
and therefore the genius of the conspiracy against Jeremy Cristol's midnight
cookies and soda ("Intra-bubble
activism," Sept. 9, pg. 15). Yes, I doomed
Swarthmore to have the student-run
Media Lounge instead of a convenience
store. I found Mr. Cristol's recent column to be an ideal companion to my
nightly ritual of sinister mustachetwirling, and hope to repay with a few
comments of my own. An evil mastermind has to describe all his schemes,
you see: It's in the contract.
My first trick was to make the SwaWa proposal be for a convenience store
open only between 6 p.m. and 2 a.m.,
since 24 hours was never the plan in
the first place ("Three gameroom plans
gain approval," Oct. 26, 2000, pg. 3).

Next, I devised and installed a number of so-called "vending machines" in

most campus dorms, rendering the

Swa-Wa idea mostly redundant.
Third, as Mr. Cristol notes, I amazthe
ingly
prevented
Swa-Wasupporting majority at Swarthmore
from voting at all, despite the easy 30second polling process and ample
opportunities across several days. I did
this by spiking the Lucky Charms with
mind control serum. The bells rang out
my commands.
Fourth, I'm pretty sure I made
many more than 300 people vote, but
regardless I saw that we eked out our
win by only 203 votes ("SCCS wins
gameroom space in runoff," Nov. 30,
2000, pg. 7). I did this so that upstart
columnists in later years wouldn't
engage in preposterous fretting over
"failures of democracy."
But really, my superior swindle was
timing the referendum for a student
body full of forward-thinking folks who
knew that midnight snack runs are

September 23, 2004

less exciting than an organization and
space dedicated to the creative uses of
technology. They knew that SCCS seminars and photo equipment lending
were only the tip of the iceberg, that if
they ever had something novel, chal-

lenging, enterprising or artistic they
wanted to do with computers, the SCCS

would be a valuable resource. Try the
SCCS out, everyone there are only a
few campus organizations like it in the
entire nation. (Also, it's connected to
lots of alumni who do lots of interesting things, if I do say so myself.) Send
them an e-mail.
Who knows
if the rest of the class
of 2005 is as stomach-minded as the
reflective Mr. Cristol, I might never
have been able to achieve my fiendish
plans had I started a year later. Timing
is everything! Something to consider
and
a Fresca.

Rethinking democracy
If there is one foundational assumption of American foreign
policy, it is that the best form of government is democracy. We

believe that as lone as we sive this "Democreed" of ours a little
nudge here and there, it will
captivate the rest of the
world with its charm.
Recent headlines, however, tell a different story
about the "inevitable" adoption of our Democreed.
Hang on to your hats,
because this column is a
whirlwind tour of what I
believe will be four of this
decade's defining events, all
of them crammed into the
last two weeks.
GARTH
We start in Indonesia,
SHELDON-COULSON
where six years ago the
economy was in free fall and
Sandpaper
violent protests rocked the
mm
,^

streets. Yet on Monday,
Indonesians elected their own president for the first time, choosing an unlikely army general-turned-Ph.D. over a powerful
incumbent and a few radical Islamists. Six years of reform have
paid off: Economic growth is at 5 percent per year and terrorism
is under control. All in the world's largest Muslim country.
The Economist said it best: "Whenever they are given a
not just in Indonesia, but in Malaysia,
choice, Muslim voters

India, Pakistan and arguably Turkey too
reject extremism.
Once weighed in the democraticbalance and found wanting, the
more militant groups tend to lose much of their potency."
Indonesia's experience soundly affirms our Democreed. But
Indonesia is hardly the only story in the news.
Consider Russia, our second headline-maker of the week. On
Sept. 13 President Vladimir Putin effectively scrapped local elections for parliamentarians and regional governors. That's right:
This week marks the beginning of the end of democracy in
Russia (if you thought Putin did not have full control before).
But a swan song can be sweet. The fact remains that Russia's
democracy, especially at the regional level, was corrupt. Its
economy is shot. Terrorist attacks completely aside, the
Democreed seems to have been wrong for Russia. Putin was
looking for a new model, a model for consolidating state power
and pushing the country in a better direction, faster.
Is it any wonder he looked to China?
Cut to Beijing, where yet another historic headline was made
this week. On Sunday, China's former president finally relinquished his clinging hold over the military. The handover of full
power to President Hu Jintao marks the first peaceful transfer
of power under Communist rule
a historic symbol, if ever
there were one, that Communist China is here to stay.
Despite its having given the Democreed the finger, China is
thriving. Its economic growth hardly requires a mention, but
there are other signs of health as well. In Hong Kong's recent
election, the only Chinese nationals with a real vote gave proChina, pro-business candidates an unexpected thumbs-up over
pro-democracy candidates. In other words, China's government
in many cases, brilliant policy. The
is making good policy
slow amalgamation of vibrant market economics with one-party
rule appears to be working brilliantly, all while President Hu
explicitly disavows the Democreed.
To drill that last point home, consider the last historic event
we are going to visit today: the transfer ofpower that is taking
place right here in the world's "seminal" democracy.
Like it or not, this election is a circus
and a bad one at that.
Talk of our trade deficit is being eclipsed by brouhahas over
Kerry's shrapnel wounds. Ideologically volatile issues such as
gay marraige and gun control dominate a debate they should not.
In this atmosphere, is it really any surprise that the best candidate for the country might not get elected? That China, Russia
and most of the Muslim world look at us and wonder why they
would ever even consider joining the fold?
On one hand, Indonesia demonstrates that, yes, democracy
works. It moderates radicalism, extends freedom and can promote economic growth. But at the same time, it does not suit
every country and can be taken too far, such as when elections
become hyped popularity contests or produce economic policies
the likes of which China's staid rulers would balk at.
So if we were under the impression that democracy was the
inevitable finish line for the whole world, these two weeks leave
no doubt that we should think again. Instead, the next 30 years
will see a continual ebb and flow of democracy as countries
experiment with it, adapt it and occasionally reject it outright.
Which leads one to wonder: Perhaps the rest of the world
sees something we don't.

Choices imperfect but not 'evil'
Dear Editor:
I feel obligated to respond to the
misconceptions that were levied
against my plea for more student
activism in Democratic politics, at
least until Nov. 2 ("Take Real
Action: Vote John Kerry", Sept. 9,
pg. 14).
Let me first reiterate my original argument. There were two
points I tried to make. One: I tried
to encourage those people on campus who are doing little, if anything, yet hold strong beliefs on
political issues, to get more
involved. Second: The priority at
this point in time for those involved
in generally progressive activist
organizations such as Amnesty and
Earthlust should be to help get
Kerry elected. Since Pennsylvania
is a swing state and this election is
pivotal to the success of many of
these causes, it is essential that
believers in justice go work for
John Kerry. Once Kerry is elected,
they can rightly focus their efforts
on their true goals, which I did call
noble.
The same cannot be said for Mr.
German's letter in last week's
Phoenix ("Don't vote for either of
two evils", Sept. 16, pg. 14). The
headline itself was not the work of
Mr. German, but it is derived from
a line in which Mr. German says,
"How will we be able to respect ourselves
should evil (whether

'greater' or 'lesser') be triumphant
on Nov. 3?" To call either President
Bush or Senator Kerry "evil" is not
only disrespectful, but puts faithful,

homosexuals from marrying or a
government that allows homosexuals to file taxes together and visit
each other in the hospital? It's not
that difficult of a choice.
Let me concede that Mr. German
is correct in that Kerry is not in
support of Kyoto, and I was mistaken to include it, but I think it is
clear that Kerry would do a far bet-

friendly policy than President
Bush. Check out the Sierra Club's
Web site and see who they support.
To make such a claim that "John
Kerry is not actually on [the liberals'] side" is frankly wrong, given
that Kerry's voting record in the
Senate is one of the most liberal
around, more liberal than Ted
Kennedy's over the past 20 years.
And to claim that I only support
Kerry "out of opposition to Bush" is
fruitless. Mr. German, whom I do
not even know, should not be claiming to know what my motives are.
The mere suggestion that I only
support Kerry out of opposition to
Bush, without any basis in fact, is
insulting to my ability to answer
the only question that should matter: Who would make the better
president? To imply anything lesser
is, in my opinion, libelous.
So let me clarify: I support
Kerry because I agree with him
more than with Bush. I admit that
there are a few beliefs that I do not
share with him, but that does not
hinder my will to see him elected
and I will proudly, with love of
country and humankind being my
guide, work for Kerry and the
Democratic Party, at least until
Nov. 2. The day after, with Kerry as
President-elect, our work for social
justice and the rights of all creatures should resume.

well-intentioned public servants on

Let's reserve the word evil for
Hitler and Stalin, not Bush or
Kerry. We can still respect the men

without respecting their policies.
Perhaps Kerry is not the ideal
person to represent
anti-war
activism. I'll concede that. But he
would still run a more "sensible"
war on terror than Bush. And as for
civil liberties, a Kerry administration wouldn't have John Ashcroft
running the Justice Department.
That would be a victory for all
ACLU devotees. It is true that
Kerry doesn't "support" gay marriage. He has, however, come out
for civil unions and against the proposed constitutional amendment

Voting your conscience by compromising
Dear Editor:
Unlike the election of 2000, this year's campaign has
been marked by divisiveness unseen in decades. So I
was surprised to read the Sept. 16 letter by David
German 'OB ("Don't vote for either of two evils," pg. 14)
claiming that Kerry and Bush are essentially one and
the same on policy issues. There are almost as many
opinions about how and why one should vote (or not
vote) as there are people on campus. But I think we
should move past the simplistic belief, expressed by

German, that our elections are a choice between the
moral and unelectable, and the electable and immoral.
In his op-ed last week ("Working outside the ballot
box," pg. 15), Evan Greer said, "I can't think of a single
campus action group who would say that all of their
demands would be met by either of the candidates." I
can't think of any individuals who would say
the same. We forget, in
this information age, that
change is supposed to
take time. As bothersome
as that is to some, it is the
push
way our democracy was
designed. It is what reassures me that if progressives can't seize absolute
control in a single day, at
least conservatives cannot either. (The current domination of our government by right-wing Republicans
was achieved only after 30 years of work and organizing. We should follow their example.)
This November, I will follow David German'sadvice
and let my conscience be my guide: I will vote for John
Kerry. But I will not vote for Kerry because he meets
he doesn't. And I will not vote for
all my demands
him just to get rid of Bush. I will vote for him because
my conscience tells me that I should push this country
a little to the left this election, so I can push more the
next time, and more after that.
And I do believe a vote for Kerry will push the coun>
try to the left. He has ruled out reinstating the draft.

Only Kerry and Kucinich among candidates this year
received full perfect ratings from Students Against the
Death Penalty, and Kerry is the first major party candidate since Swarthmore's own Dukakis to oppose it.
Kerry opposes codifying hatred in the
U.S.
Constitution through the anti-gay Federal Marriage
Amendment. And in the Kerry policy guide quoted by
German as evidence of a bad environmental policy, in
the sentence following the words "the' Kyoto protocol is
not the answer," it says, "the long term obligations
imposed [by the protocol] on all nations are too little to
stop the problem." In the same policy guide is a $lO billion proposal for Clean Coal Development that makes
both labor and environmentalists happy.
I look at Kerry and see a politician who voted to
authorize Bush to go to the U.N. and seek war, true. But
I also look at him and see
i the man that came back
from Vietnam with the
courage to speak against the

cause for which he had once

been willing to give his life.
I look at Kerry and I see the
man who, not much older
than we are, asked a question of our leaders many
Swatties want to repeat
today: "How do you ask a
man to be the last man to die for a mistake?"
How to vote is a deeply personal decision that each
voter must weigh alone. I base my decision on my
belief that our democracy is flawed but not broken.
And so I choose to work toward my political goals
"within the system." Are there Swatties who disagree
with me? Certainly. But none of us are better off when
our debate is limited to the simplistic dichotomy of
conscience versus electability, when we either demonize or deify candidates, and when we refuse to
acknowledge that I can indeed be following my conscience even when voting for someone I don't always
agree with.

Who needs an AK-47?

ronan

This year, Monday the 13th
was way, way scarier than any

Friday the 13th. Last week, on
Sept. 13, the Federal Assault
Weapons Ban expired without so
much as a "Wait! Huh?" from
George W Bush, who, four years
ago, said he'd defend it with all
his heart (and NRA influence).
The expiration of the ten-year
ban signed into law by President
Clinton means that firearms like
AK-475, Uzis and TEC-9s, which
have a capacity for up to 30
MAYA SCHENWAR rounds of ammunition, will be
legally up for grabs in a gun shop
near you.
Sure, they're nifty looking and
come in a variety of fun colors
(see gunsnstnffonline.com), but these babies are no Super
Soakers. Many say that higher-capacity guns give criminals
more firepower to use in gang wars or against police. Assault
weapons were employed in the shootings of one out of five law
enforcement officers killed from 1998 to 2001, according to the
FBI. They were instrumental in the Columbine Massacre, the
2000 shooting in Wakefield, Mass, and the sniper attacks that
claimed victims across the DC area in 2002. Clearly, it's time to
crack down on gun laws and make assault weapons scarcer
not more accessible than a can of beer in Pennsylvania.
The NRA may cry constitutional freedom, but there's no
question about Second Amendment rights here: Nowhere in the
Bill of Rights does it grant "The Right to Bear High-Capacity
Magazines Holding More than 10 Rounds of Ammunition." The
right to bear arms never meant any kind of arms; anyone hording nukes in their basement can expect the feds to interfere.
There's no legally defensible reason why an assault weapon
would be of more use than any other available firearm.
Some gun lobbyists argue that banning assault weapons discriminates against hunters. Yet the specific gun features
banned by the law, including military-style pistol grips, flash
suppressors, bayonet mounts and grenade launchers, have little
use for hunters or competitive marksmen. The flash suppressor, for example, is designed to hide the location of the shooter
from a human target. And who needs a grenade launcher nowadays? A lot of us, apparently. ArmaLite, Inc., a large gun manufacturer outside Chicago, has been taking prepaid orders for
high-capacity guns since months before the ban ended.
Why? Organizations like the National Shooting Sports
Foundation argue that the target customer is the military armament collector, "a guy who wants to buy a firearm because it
reminds him of the one he carried in 'Nam." But for those of us
who believe that safe streets are more important than some
guy's living-room-cabinet gun collection, what to do?
I hate to propose the same solution as countless Phoenix
columns before me (not to mention those in The Philadelphia
Inquirer, The Chicago Tribune, The Onion ...), but here's a circumstance in which there really is a difference between Bush
and Kerry. Though Bush promised to renew the assault ban
during his campaign months, he hasn't raised the issue since.
Not only does Kerry pledge to work for the restoration of
assault weapons laws, he's in favor of more stringent background checks and scrutiny of purchases at gun shows.
Although, in a recent statement, he hastily disclaimed,
"Heavens to Betsy, I've been a hunter all my life" (awww ... look
),
at little Johnny-two-year-old with the semi-automatic
Kerry is all for the enforcement of existing gun laws and the
prevention of interstate gun trafficking.
He also advocates providing full funding to the Community
Oriented Policing Services program (COPS), which Bush plans
to cut from $482 million to $97 million next year. COPS focuses
on preventing crime on a local basis, helping community residents and policing professionals work together to make neighborhoods safer. Sure, Kerry's not anyone's top pick for Gun
Control President, but at least he's not hugging the gun lobby
every step of the way.
The expiration of the federal ban comes at an ironic time.
Last week, the Justice Department reported that last year's
crime rate was the lowest since 1973, continuing a steady 10year trend that shows violent crime decreasing. The Federal
Assault Weapons Ban was 10 years old when it died last
Monday. Of course, no one can claim a direct correlation
between the ban and the drop in crime. But why stop while
we're ahead? Restoring the Federal Assault Weapons Ban and
cracking down on gun control laws nationwide can only mean
fewer people dying. And, heavens to Betsy, who can argue with
that?

Quit using political purity tests
phartl@swarthmore.edu
On any RA's list of fun hall activities, having a group
purity test session probably tops the list. For any who do
not know, a purity test is a questionnaire that asks 100
probing questions about a person's sexual life. A score of
0 is totally impure, while a score of 100 is totally pure.
Most people, naturally enough, end up somewhere in

between.

The purity test, though definitely embarrassing, is

harmless. What is not harmless, though, is the trend of

applying ideological purity tests to the upcoming presidential election. I am fed up with people saying things
like "Kerry's not for gay

for him," even though

this one: "Kerry's pro-war, so I'm not voting for him."
Yes, Kerry supported giving Bush the authorization to
attack Iraq; he also has repeatedly said that he would not
have gone to war based on false premises and would have
assembled a true international coalition with real
strength. The course Kerry would have followed on Iraq
would have been very different from Bush's "us-versusthem" exploit-fear-of-terrorism-to-gain-popular-support
strategy.
The fact is that John Kerry is an imperfect candidate.
He is, however, light-years better than Bush on the key
issues facing our country, as a look at both his voting
record and his issue papers on johnkerry.com indicate.
More fundamentally, the purists' complaints about Kerry
reveal two misperceptions: one about American democracy and the other about the nature of voting itself.
The purists' first major error lies in not acknowledg-

THE PHOENIX

the American political system
is ill-suited to small, issue-based parties. Such parties
sometimes flourish in countries with parliamentary government systems or run-off elections. Run-off elections
allow people to vote for the candidate with whom their
views align mostly closely without worrying about
potentially throwing the election to their least-favorite
candidate. In the United States, though, we have a winner-take-all system that pays little heed to proportionality, and, through the magic of the unpleasant electoral college, occasionally produces a winner who is not even the
candidate who received the most votes! Is this system
fair? Not in my book, but it is the system we have right
now. In such a system, the most likely effect of a far-left
candidacy such as Ralph

the purists' second major error. Many of them do seem to
understand that a vote is not merely an expression of an
idea; it is also an action that, like all actions, has consequences. When I go into the voting booth, I do not ask
myself what vote will make me feel warm and fuzzy

No more margins A seat-snatcher lurks among us
of error in voting
BY ALEX GINSBERG

agisnbel@swarthmore.edu

Student Council is, in theory, a group that represents the
needs, interests and concerns
of the student body to the larger Swarthmore community. It
is an entity whose influence
has a direct and significant
impact on the students' quality of life during their four

years on campus. Therefore, it

RANDY GOLDSTEIN

Bursting the Bubble

is crucial to our well-being
that we elect representatives
who are able and willing to
perform their duties faithfully
and competentlys. For that to
occur, however, we must have
full confidence in the accuracy and validity of our voting

procedure.
In the recent vote for
Educational Policy Representative, there was a margin of
error of 43 votes, 6.3% of the total votes recorded. This margin
of error was so large that a run-off election was deemed necessary to determine the true winner. The Student
Constitution of Swarthmore College defines that margin of
error as "the difference between the number of voters recorded and the number of ballots marked. If the difference in
votes between two candidates or between one candidate and

'None of the above' is less than the margin of error for that
election, no candidate shall be declared the winner, and a special election shall be held to fill the seat." This definition
reveals more than the nature of the uncertainty regarding the
true winner of this most recent election. It also represents a
major flaw in the way that Student Council elections are con-

ducted in general.
The term "margin of error" usually arises when statistics
are compiled using a random sample of a given population. In
the months prior to national elections, pollsters survey likely voters to forecast probable winners, usually including
margins of error within those forecasts. On the day after the
election, however, votes have been tallied and a winner is
declared. There is no margin of error because the purpose of
a democratic election is to count individual votes as precisely as possible. That 43 votes were unaccounted for in the
recent Student Council election represents a major student
voter disenfranchisement that, with a more meticulous voting mechanism, would not exist.
The need to present results with a margin of error seems
to be the result of the fractured way in which StudentCouncil
collects votes. By combining online voting with paper ballot
voting in Sharpies, confusion as to who exactly has and has
not voted is sure to ensue. On more than one occasion, I have
noted that to fraudulently vote on behalf of someone else in
Sharpies' lobby would pose little challenge. With the existence of online voting, why resort to this error-ridden paperand-pencil method at all?
If this discrepancy between voting methods is indeed the
main source of the margin of error, Student Council must
look seriously at eliminating paper ballots. So much important college business is now conducted electronically that
moving to a paperless election system makes complete sense.

Online voting is inclusive of students who live off campus
and students who are abroad. If the reason for paper ballots
in Sharpies is to combat voter apathy, Student Council ought
to address the apathy itself rather than cling to a system that
is severely flawed at best.
Though Student Council has striven to make its work
more effective via its Web site, this technical initiative is also
sorely lacking. The site is rarely updated, and its most useful
feature, the Philly Van sign-up, is clunky and confusing. It
seems possible that by hiring an individual with the relevant
technical expertise, Student Council could ensure greater
accuracy of elections and work towards better online services in general.
Though a perfect voting system may be unattainable, a
6.3% margin of error is simply unacceptable. Student Council,
however, is not helpless to resolve this problem. Rather than
maintain the status quo, it must seek a long-term solution in
order to truly reflect the will of the student body. If the
Student Council cannot competently conduct elections of its
own members, there is little reason to trust that those members are truly the best candidates for improving life at
Swarthmore.

Beware! Everyone, please, in all

I know what many of you are

Swarthmore is such a tight-knit
community full of kind human
beings." Well, friends, view-books
and admissions reps lie! How many

being in a comforting environment

pointment stings with the venom of

well. So, let me endeavor to tell this

Wednesday and Friday I woke at
about 8 a.m., showered and strolled

before skipping over to Calculus lIA
at 9:30. Arriving about fifteen minutes early, I chose the best seat in
class. It was the golden throne of my
dork-dreams, front row center, and I
loved it. My position in seating
geography allowed me to see and
hear clearly. Lord, those were good
times.

Whatever happened to

And then, treachery. A late
Sunday night blossomed into a
rushed Monday morning, and I
found myself forgoing the usual
shower and Phoenix breakfast sandwich in the name of punctuality. If
this weren't enough, my morning
was about to get a lot worse. I
always say, when it rains, it pours,
and then you get bitch-slapped.
As I opened the door to class, fate
laughed in my face, exposing me to
the worst of all forms of academic
deceit. Some scoundrel sat in my
spot, an evil grin on his face. What

Perhaps some of you may laugh at
my anger. Some may think it childish that I believe I have claim on my
seat. Well, you suck! For two weeks I
took the same exact spot. Did he
think I would sit somewhere else?
So what if I wasn't as early as usual?
The benefit of the doubt should be
given that I would come and sit in
the same place. Even ifI decided not
to show up, the seat should have
been left open in my name.
Whatever happened to the unspoken
laws of the high school seating
arrangement? This man's ambition
to "get to the head of the class" has
turned him into nothing more than
an animal and has caused me to feel
the need to return to my primal
nature. From now on I shall mark
my territory in the way of the wild
odor. If necessary, I will defend it
in mortal combat.
In the meantime, you know who
you are. Never again will you steal
my seat. Now everyone is aware of
your ways, and it will not be long
before your band of seat looters is
exiled from the once-pleasant campus of Swarthmore.
Until then, I say to the rest of the
people of Swarthmore: Friends,
watch your backs, and your seats.

Litterers, your mother doesn't live here
Dear Editor:
I sometimes wonder about the
student body when I look around
our campus. Were my peers
brought up in wealthy households
where maintaining order and cleanliness was delegated to others? I am
ceaselessly amazed at the amount of

trash left strewn across campus
each day by the inconsiderate souls
with whom I attend school. I am
constantly surprised by the state in
which students leave the common
areas. For example, last week I
went to watch the news in the trailer connecting Dana and Hallowell.
Red plastic cups lay strewn across
the floor surrounding a beer ball
left by some party group from the
night before. I can't understand the
mentality of individuals who think
that the rest of the world's only pur-

pose is to clean up after them.
I realize as I contemplate this
anomaly that in fact what bothers
me is that a group of such environmentally conscientious students
can act in such a fashion. Clearly,
in some respects, the student body
respects its habitat. There is no
graffiti on the walls, and for the
most part living spaces are kept at a
decently clean level. Why, then, do
these same students habitually
destroy our common living spaces

through laziness and negligence

with their trash?

In my opinion, the problem lies
much deeper than a simple disre-

gard for their environment. The
students here are experiencing a
lack of control. There is no one to
put them in check, no mother to
remind them to clean up after them-

selves. Students are experiencing a
lack of external restraint. I look
around and see that this is in fact a
small part of a much larger problem.
Swarthmore students, like any
college students, are experiencing

freedom for the first time. They are

at liberty to make choices. We have
created a society in which our children are so inherently sheltered
that once they step out of their comfort zones, their homes, they are
confronted with endless opportunity and lack the ability to constrain
their desires. That, in essence, is
the problem. As for the garbage,
well, what can I say? It seems to
have become a fact of life; my only
hope is not to become a part of this
tragedy of the commons.

Swarthmore athletes from August to April
A look at the experiences of three-sport athletes who wear garnet and gray all year
BY DARCY NELSON

dnelsonl@swarthmore.edu

Drop the cleats. Now put on the goggles. Now, quick,
step up to the plate.
For the three-sport athletes at Swat, athletic competition starts during fall preseason, before the rest of the
school arrives, and does not end until final examinations
in May. Anyone who plays a sport knows the kind of commitment involved in collegiate athletics. So how do these
athletes manage a sport every season of the school year?
Jessica Zagory 'O5 plays soccer in the fall and participates in indoor and outdoor track in the winter and spring.
But sports are only a portion of her academic and extracurricular schedule.

"The

common denominator of my

athletic experience is that I had
great coaches."
Rob Melick 'O4

She admits that the balance is difficult. "You have to
self-impose breaks for yourself, and if you are a competitive person by nature, it is difficult to take that break,"
Zagory said. Nevertheless, she feels that three seasons of
sports is not her main source of stress.
"I find that the pressure mostly comes from the other
activities that I do outside of sports," she said. Sports also
frequently rule out the possibility of catching up on sleep
or work on the weekends. "So far, most of my weekends
have been taken up with tournaments, which has been difficult," she said.
Sarah Hobbs 'O6 also plays soccer and runs indoor and
outdoor track. "I just feel lucky to be in a position where
I can devote two-plus hours a day to sports," she said. This
fall, she is running cross country in addition to playing
soccer. "Doing soccer and cross country is noticeably
harder, just in that I never want to walk to the third floor,
and that I avoid the hill to Parrish at all costs," Hobbs

said.
Maila Sepri 'O5, who has done swimming and outdoor
track for the past three years, now runs cross country as
well. She has found that the trick is budgeting time for the
sake of classes and other academic clubs. "But, as all runners agree, it's a lifestyle, not just practice," Sepri said. "I
set aside the 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. block of time for sports and
then schedule the rest of my time around homework and
such."

This year will be her first experience transitioning
swimming. "When I decided to run

from cross country to

cross country, my major concern was coordinating it
with swimming, since the cross country season overlaps
with the swimming preseason," Sepri said. "I want to
make sure that I'm not jeopardizing my swimming season, so I go to early morning open swims. When official
swimming seasons start, I will attend those practices a
few days a week."
The issue of classes also arises when athletes must balance their academic schedule with the demands of sports
teams. Although away games and evening practices can
conflict with academics, many athletes have not found
sports too limiting. "I have chosen some classes based on
scheduling, but I have mostly taken what I have wanted to
take," Zagory said.
Vernon Chaplin 'O7, another soccer and indoor/outdoor
track athlete, has had to sacrifice a class because of sports
scheduling. An astrophysics major, Chaplin could not take
a class with many evening labs because of soccer practice.
"Soccer is not as flexible as running, so I tried to not take
classes on Wednesday afternoons, since we have games on
those days," Chaplin said.
Even with all of the commitments, these athletes enjoy
competing in all three seasons. "We work during practice,
but it does not feel like work because we have fun," Zagory
said. "I really enjoy my teams and the support that they
give me."
Chaplin does not feel too much pressure competing all
three seasons. "You get in a routine at the beginning, so it
is not a big deal doing track in the spring after doing soccer in the fall," he said.
One sacrifice that most three-sport athletes must make
is the opportunity to go abroad for a semester. "I was a little sad that I didn't get to go abroad, but I have really
enjoyed my time here," Zagory said.
Some athletes do not feel it is a sacrifice. "There isn't a
season I want to give up, so I will probably wait until I
graduate," Hobbs said. Others, such as Sepri and Chaplin,
have ruled out the possibility of going abroad for academic as well as athletic reasons.
Rob Melick 'O4 played football as a first-year and did
indoor and outdoor track as well. Melick's experience participating in three sports had some negative aspects.
"Because of my involvement in sports, I felt marginalized
by many fellow Swatties," he said. "I don't know what the
source of this tension was. All athletes take the same classes and live in the same dorms." Melick, however, was not
deterred by this tension. After football was cut, Melick ran
cross country his senior year. "The common denominator
of my athletic experience is that I had great coaches," he
said.
Most three-sport athletes would not have it any other
way. "Despite being so busy, practice is the part of the day
that I look forward to, so it's worth every minute of it!"
Sepri said. "Everything I do is really important to me, so I
couldn't imagine giving anything up."

Sarah Hobbs is one of a handful of athletes who participates in varsity sports for three season. This year, in
addition to soccer, indoor and outdoor track, Hobbs is
running with the women's cross country team.
"Overall, I think that all students here really deserve
accolades because most people here are really committed
to something," Hobbs said. "My German class can attest to
the fact that German would not be my strong pursuit. I
don't think athletes do anything special here in terms of
time management we all do. So, they know all the verbs,
and I can trap the ball. In the end, it just comes down to
doing what you love."

Don't bet on it Field hockey splits Seven Sisters

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

After writing last week about the NCAA's desire to crack
down on athletes who break rules, I thought it might be a
good idea to check out the rules that apply to Swarthmore's
student-athletes. After all, men's soccer is 4-0 now, so it's
only a matter of time before the NCAA comes a-knocking to
make sure we're not violating any of its precious statutes.
That's why I swung by the athletic department to pick up
NCAA's most recent literary masterpiece, "Don't Bet On It"
(current odds anyone is reading this column: 100-1).
The booklet started out innocently enough, presenting a
series of facts highlighting recent incidents that include

end. While heavy rain postponed all matches on
Saturday, the team came out with tons of energy for the
Sunday games.

Their first game against Smith was a highly defensive battle that went scoreless in regulation. Though
the Garnet out shot Smith 24-15, they could not score

and lost some momentum heading into overtime.

Within the first minute of the overtime, Smith scored
the winning goal, and Swarthmore suffered their first
loss of the season.
However, the ladies were not deterred for long, as
they got pumped up for their second game against rival
Haverford. Swarthmore's co-captain Joanna Hess 'O5
gave the team the early lead when she scored the first
goal, assisted by Jessica Larson 'O6, at 20:54 in the first
half. After Heidi Fieselmann 'O6 made it 2-0, the Garnet
looked to finish off the Fords. Unfortunately, our rivals
would not quit and scored two quick goals less than
five minutes after Fieselmann's goal, tying the game at

point-shaving scandals at

Arizona
and
State
Northwestern. I think we
can all agree that it's bad
news for sports when college kids agree to miss a few
more shots and throw a

game for a wad of cash.
However, it's not like
Swarthmore is swarming
with bookies; Vegas oddsmakers act as if Division 111
sports don't exist. In fact, I'd
wager (note to NCAA: just
kidding, I would never bet
on anything
ever) that
MATT SCHILLER
there isn't a single person in
the entire world who would
Cowbell
bet on a Swarthmore sporting event. Then, I read that
some Division I women's
soccer players entered a college sports pool, which led to a
two-game suspension and 10 hours of community service.
Now, I'm not sure that their gambling did any real harm,
but I can see how there could've been some conflict of interest if they were betting on their own sport. Really, though,
is this sort of insignificant stuff really what the NCAA
wants to go after?
Regardless, I understand that the NCAA has to take
some stance on the subject and gambling on the sport you
play should be illegal. I didn't take issue until I turned the
page to see rules specifically stating "NO fantasy leagues
that award a prize," and "NO exchange of information
about your team with ANYONE who gambles." Why can't I
do these things? Because it threatens my personal integrity,
corrupts sports, and attracts organized crime, according to
the NCAA. Well, it figures that the NCAA would be familiar
with all three of those things (odds anyone is still reading
this column: 5000-1).
The NCAA seems to go out of its way to see the entire situation in black and white. It repeatedly points out that all
bets, even friendly ones, are the same evil, without any
explanation as to why such a reality must be the case. We
should just take their word for it. Theoretically, if I tell my
friend who plays fantasy football that I'm injured, I could be
ruled ineligible to compete and kicked off my team. Are you
kidding me?
The pamphlet goes on to warn that money skimmed
from sports betting is often used to "fund drug sales" and
"keep prostitution rings going." So, if I have this right, any
athlete here who pays $5 to join a March Madness pool is
indirectly funding drug dealers and prostitutes? Just to
clarify, the NCAA adds two notes on organized crime, warning students that they can become pawns without even
knowing it. Yeah, I wouldn't want to become a pawn of that
huge crime syndicate ESPN by paying a few bucks to make
the football season more interesting (odds anyone found
this joke funny: 6,000,000-1).
But maybe they're right. It did take three people, including a Ph.D., to write this 22-page behemoth. I can't argue
with all the research they cite to back up their facts (note:
if there are footnotes, I'm still looking). Now I'm scared.
What should we do? Since the NCAA clearly takes student-athletes for total idiots who are too naive to see the
distinction between serious illegal betting and friendly
wagers, they'd never tell you to bet on anything, right?
Let's see what they have to say in conclusion, shall we:
"Why not bet on a sure thing: yourself." Um, Mr. Ph.D.,
that's exactly what those Arizona State players were
doing. Does anyone think that if the NCAA wasn't so preoccupied with money, it'd spend less time trying to prosecute meaningless wagers by student-athletes and focus on
more pressing threats to the integrity of college sports? All
bets are off.

The game continued to be hard fought as it took not
but two overtimes to find a winner.
Goalkeeper Karen Lorang 'O7 had to fight off many
shots to keep the Garnet in the game, as she recorded
19 saves. Finally, at the 92:24 mark, Neema Patel 'O7
received the ball from classmate Julie Monaghan 'O7
and scored the winning goal. The 3-2 double overtime
win over Haverford ended the tournament for
Swarthmore with a record of 1-1, bringing their overall
record to 5-1.
The tournament did not crown a champion in the
21st annual competition due to the postponed games on
Sunday. This tournament, first organized by the seven
sister schools - Wellesley, Smith, Mount Holyoke,
Bryn
Mawr, Vassar, Radcliffe and Barnard.
Swarthmore and Haverford have since replaced the
last two teams.
The Garnet has its conference opener this Saturday.
The Tide will host Gettysburg at 1 p.m. With the hard
fought win over Haverford, these ladies have plenty of
drive to carry them into the conference matches and
their 5-1 record will force their opponents to come prepared. Even though the Seven Sisters Tournament was
almost washed out, our ladies' field hockey team is
ready to wash out all of their challengers.

Women's volleyball takes tournament title
BY GENEVRA PITTMAN
gpittmal@swarthmore.edu
What a difference a week can make.

After a disappointing showing at the
and
a tough loss in their first home match
Muhlenberg Buttermaker Tournament

against

Franklin and Marshall, the
Swarthmore volleyball
team turned
around last weekend and captured the title
in its home tournament, the Garnet

Classic.
The Garnet swept through its early

games in the tournament, shutting out
both Cabrini College (30-14, 30-7, 30-20) and
Kean University (30-24, 30-28, 30-21). The
wins allowed Swarthmore to win its pool
and clinch a berth in the championship
match Saturday evening against Alvernia
College, which came into the tournament
at 6-2.
The opening game remained close until
Stephanie Koskowich 'O7 started serving
with Swarthmore leading 10-9. Koskowich
scored an ace on her first serve and then
led the team on a run to a 15-9 advantage.
Swarthmore's lead grew to as high as eight
after a tip by Karen Berk 'OB to make it 2618, but Alvernia came back to make it dangerously close at 29-26. Vanessa Wells 'OB
erased any Avernia hope with a tip on the
next play to close out the game for the
Garnet, 30-26.
Swarthmore was in control of the second game, opening with an 8-3 lead behind
the intimidating jump serve of tournament MVP Erica George 'O7 and never
took the pressure off. At 19-10, George led
another scoring rally for the Garnet, caus-

ing the Crusaders to call a timeout at 24-10.
But Berk closed out the game with two
strong blocks that gave Swarthmore a 3014 victory and a two game cushion in the
match.
Yet victory was anything but certain
after Alvernia came back to win a tough
third game, 30-23, and took the momentum
away from the Garnet. The game was close
early on and tied at 14-14 before an
Alvernia run gave the Crusaders an 18-14
lead that Swarthmore could never take
back.
Like the third game, the fourth was close
early on, and midway through Alvernia
had a 15-14 lead, which it soon increased to
19-15. But two George kills and a tip by
Berk put pressure on the Crusaders and
forced the team to call a timeout with a slim
20-19 lead. Swarthmore kept its run alive to
take a 22-20 lead, its first of the game since
2-L But it was a lead the Garnet would hold
on to this time, as kills by Berk and
Vanessa Wells 'OB set up Koskowich to end
the game with an ace at 30-25.
Libero Patrice Berry 'O6 finished the
day with a team-high 54 digs while blockers Berk and Wells posted 50 kills and 10
blocks between them.The win clinched the

Garnet its first tournament title on the
season, all the more special because it was
at home.

"We finally clicked this weekend,"
Dunphy said. "[The victory] allows us to
see that we can win. It motivates us for the
rest of the season; it lets us know that the
goals we set are possible."

came together to show the kind of play they
did last weekend. "It was great," Leach
said. "We definitely gelled as a team."
Tuesday night, the team traveled to
Washington College and lost a tight five

game match, 22-30, 30-19, 22-30, 30-23, 12-15.
George paces the Tide with 18 kills and 21
digs while Emily Conlon 'O6 added 41 assists

Reiss grabs first place in Swarthmore Invite
Jon Reiss 'O7 walked away victoriously
from the Swarthmore Invitational Tennis
Tournament last weekend, winning four
matches against stiff competition to take
the title in the men's singles "A" Flight.
Reiss played exceptionally well throughout the tournament, finishing his run by
defeating John Tully from the University of
Delaware in the finals 6-4, 6-1 to grab the
title.
"I felt like I was very nervous for my
first match," Reiss said. "But I got a little
better and gained confidence every match,
and by the end I was playing really well."

THE PHOENIX

Reiss' victory was the highlight of the
weekend tournament for the men's tennis
team, as they have been preparing for the
ITA Regional tournament to be held this
weekend at Goucher College in Baltimore.

The tournament is the most important of
the fall and is used to determine regional
and national rankings for singles players.
"The goal is to hopefully repeat my performance," Reiss said of the ITA. "That
would be great, but it's going to be very
tough, as we play six matches over three
days against some really good competition"

tical positioning and shape" coach Amy
Brunner said. "We knew that we generally have very strong games with this
opponent. Our styles match up pretty
well; [it's a] controlled possession
game."
"The offense did a great job of developing through the midfield. Our connections up top were just off," coach
Brunner said. Crosses made to Jane
Sachs 'O7 and Natalie Negrey 'O7 almost
connected, but Swat could not manage
to score. "I was able to get a few shots
off," Negrey said, "but the grass was
pretty long, and I never managed to get
enough power behind them to make
them very effective. The long grass also
affected our speed of play a bit."
The Diplomats had many dangerous scoring opportunities, but were
thwarted by the Tide. Led by Jordan
Shakeshaft 'O5 and Rachel Jacobs 'O5,
the defense was solid.
The center
backs "really stepped up their communication and play to get the depth of
support we needed," coach Brunner
said. "This helped eliminate the

September 23, 2004

through balls for the most part."
Goalie Kristen Traband 'OB consistently prevented the Diplomats from

finding the back of the net. "Our
defense was more cohesive and playing
really well," Maulbeck said. "There
were a lot of one-on-one breakaways,
and Kristen had a lot of big saves."
In a scoreless second half, Nicole
Oberfoell 'O7 and Danielle Tocchet 'OB
came close to placing Swat on the
scoreboard. "We realized during the
game that their touch on the ball was
not very good," Negrey said, "so we
pressured them more and were able to
win the ball from them."
The wind worked against them, but
Swat maintained the strong defense,
with goalkeeper Rachel Jordan 'OB making big saves against the Diplomats.
"Our goal keepers both had strong
games and read the development of the
play well so they could pick off cleanly
and consistently the few through balls
that did occur," Brunner said.
The second half closed without a
score from either team, pushing the
game into overtime. The Diplomats
came out aggressively, firing shots
that hit the goal box but never made it
in. Swat's Kett scored the game-winning goal off a pass by Sarah Hobbs 'O6
for her first career goal.
"I am really proud that we pulled
through and won the game, because I
believe we were the better team"
Negrey said. "I think this first conference win is a nice start to our conference season, and I think we could surprise quite a few teams this year."
The Garnet Tide travel to Gettysburg
on Sept. 25 to take on the Bullets at
4:30 p.m.

Elastic Mike
"I guess you can never domesticate them. Like I'm not

Mike Tyson on Montecore the Tiger
Poor guy. No, not Roy
he's recovering nicely, we hear.
Tyson's the one we pity
at least we used to.
Once he was untouchable, the young pit bull destined to resurrect boxing and guide it into the 90s. Now an instant punchline on Leno, he's millions in debt, exploited by the industry that
...

previously glorified him, and ultimately designated to Manute
801-status as he bounces around from one "Oddly Enough" news
page to another. At least he's not funding civil war.
Sammy has a Tyson story he remembers it vividly because
he still wakes up in a cold sweat. Imagine: little Sammy coming
home from Hebrew school, studying to hit paydirt, or what his
parents called a "bar mitzvah," and as he waits for the light to
change, a sleek lavender
Bentley rolls up, its 12 cylinders purring. Sammy's jaw
drops, and his stare intensifies as the tinted back windows descend, revealing
Tyson's face. Mike Tyson
stares at little Sammy. Little
Sammy stares back. In a
heartbeat, the Bentley tears
out of the intersection leaving only peals of laughter.

What was so funny? The yarmulke? The stream running
SAM BELL
down Sammy's leg? Or, was
SAM BRECKENRIDGE it that Mike Tyson was simply loving life? (Did we just
The Dirty Corner
write that?)
■MMiMMMiiiiHHiMH
Since then, Evander's
lost an ear, and Mike's lost
everything. And while it
didn't all start with a rape conviction and prison time, they're
the eye-catching indicators of Mike's self-destructive tendencies. The lavender Bentleys, the pet tigers, the bar fights, and
the huge entourage probably contributed to his chaotic life. At
least that's what mainstream media tells us. And some of it is
true because we've heard it from Tyson's own mouth (though
we pretty much take everything Mike says now with a grain of

salt).
But, in an age where our knowledge of people is based on
the opinions of TV pundits and their seven second sound bites,
we think the "truth" about Iron Mike may not be as straight-

forward as it seems.
In contrast, many critics believe that Kobe Bryant benefited
from his positive celebrity, particularly in his rape trial. Kobe
doesn't have a posse or a pet tiger. He's erudite, speaking a
handful of languages. He scored well on the SATs. His game is
graceful and his style elegant. He makes sound business decisions. Could he really have committed a violent felony?
Tyson could have benefited from the media slant afforded
Kobe. The unfair public scrutiny focused on the personal life of
Mike's accuser would have surely made a difference in the outcome of the trial (as most critics agree it did in Kobe's trial). We
are not judges or a jury and we do not know whether either
man committed the crime, but respected legal minds
see
Alan Dershowitz
think that Mike's trial was mishandled,
perhaps even resulting in a wrongful conviction.
Iron Mike hasn't popped up in the news recently. Is it
because he no longer has anything newsworthy or interesting
to say? We doubt it. If people asked, I bet they'd get a lot of great
quotes. But who wants to interview the ex-champ? After his
defeat to a no-name in, of all places, Mexico, it's doubtful that
Mike will ever be the fighting force that he once was. We're
hoping that's a good thing for Mike.
In the early morning hours a couple weeks ago, we caught a
sappy story on Mike from some second-rate channel like UPN.
His new trainer, a two-bit hustler who probably knows more
about hookers than left hooks, shared that Mike's living alone
out ofhis car (not the Bentley). He's broke and ignored, but he's
out of trouble. And, get this, he refused to be interviewed for
the piece! The spin on the story was clear as day the tiger is
domesticated. But we take little joy in Mike's fall from grace. In
fact, we don'tknow whether it was a fall at all. Hopefully, away
from the bright lights, questions and constant media frenzy,
Mike will learn that he doesn't have to act the tiger. But we'd
still like to see him kick the shit out of Siegfried.

One is a magical number.

Only one goal has been scored on Swarthmore's
men's soccer team this season, coming in the Garnet's
2-1 victory over Wesley in the preseason tournament.
Over the course of five games, 490 minutes including
two overtime games Swat's opponents have found the
net only once.
Coach Eric Wagner was excited but unsurprised:
"When you have a defense that won't let you score on
the ground and a keeper that won't let you score in
the air, you win games."
Many teams may be forced to devise a system of
digging tunnels in order to circumvent a delectably
smothering defense that recently earned keeper Nate
Shupe 'O5 Centennial Conference Player of the Week
honors. Swat's victory over Dickinson on Saturday
was Shupe's first victory in overtime and
Swarthmore's first victory over this Centennial foe.
Ever. Wagner wanted to stress how much that team
effort led to Shupe's shutouts and subsequent honor.
"The confidence that he gives to the team and that
the team gives to him, is amazing."
The Dickinson match remained scoreless throughout regular time, although, coach Wagner said, "we
were in complete control of the game. We should have
scored two or three." Overtime arrived and with less
than a minute remaining, Andrew Terker 'O6, fresh off
the disabled list, scored to end the match, crushing the
life out of the Red Devils.
Overtime games are becoming old hat for the

2004

The game had much of the same feel as the match
against Dickinson; again, Swat's defense shut down
any opposition, and again, Swat had trouble finding

the net. The home crowd agonized over ridiculously-

close chances, especially as the Garnet, with the
Scranton keeper beaten, hit the post with 20 seconds
left in the first half.
To the delight of the fans, Swat made a final offensive push at the end of regulation but unfortunately
did not score. Once overtime arrived and Joe Raciti'os
led a supportive cheer as the teams took the field:
"Who's gonna win? Swat! Where are we gonna kick
'em? In the butt! In the butt! In the butt! In the butt!"
Only Swarthmore and perennial power Johns
Hopkins remain undefeated in the . Centennial
Conference. Wagner attributed the wins to the team's
depth, attitude, and mental focus. How deep is the
bench? "We've got two guys playing on the bench, juniors, who started the past two years. We've gotten

much deeper this year."

The freshman class is also making a big impact. In
addition to Brandon Washington 'OB and Michael
Bonesteel 'OB at forward, Brendan Grady 'OB has locked
down the defense. "He has been one of the best players
on the team this year. He's steady, mature, and confident," Wagner said.
The team is handling success well. "There's a target
on our back now. There is no single game in this conference that is a gimme," Wagner said. The Tide continues its deconstruction of the Centennial Conference
at Gettysburg on Sept. 25 at 2 p.m.
