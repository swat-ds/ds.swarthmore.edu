College details
emergency
response plans
BY BENJAMIN KABAK

bkabakl@swarthmore.edu

With the nation growing increasingly concerned over the
orange terror alert the Department of Homeland Security has
issued, the Swarthmore administration sent an e-mail to all faculty, students and parents last Thursday outlining campus procedures in case of an emergency.
The orange alert represents the second highest warning of an
imminent terrorist attack, and the administration felt it necessary to respond to the fears of some parents and students, according to Vice President for Administration Larry Schall '75.
"We felt it important to reassure the community that we are
paying close attention to national and international events and
taking any measures we deem prudent to be as prepared as we
can be no matter how minor the chance of such an event,"
President Al Bloom said.

"We knew the whole duct tape, plastic
sheet thing was stupid."

In NYC, students rally
BY GREG NELSON
gnelsonl@swarthmore.edu

About 75 Swarthmore students joined thousands
in New York City Saturday to protest the increasingly probable war on Iraq as part of what has been
called the largest antiwar demonstration in New
York since the Vietnam era.
Between 100,000 and 375,000 protesters, according
to various estimates, braved below-freezing temperatures in Manhattan. They formed a crowd that covered over 20 blocks on First Avenue, centering
around the United Nations building and a stage set
up at 51st and First Avenue, where a huge banner
proclaimed, "The World Says No To War." On some
blocks, the crowd stretched as far west as Third

Avenue.
Dozens of other protests took place in major cities
across the United States, including Philadelphia, Los
Angeles and Chicago, and in smaller cities like
Gainesville, Ga., and Juneau, Alaska. Protesters also
staged demonstrations in London, where 500,000 to
750,000 people rallied in Hyde Park, and in Berlin,
where 200,000 gathered at the Brandenburg Gate.
Demonstrations were also held in Australia, Asia,
Africa and even Antarctica.
The protest in New York began at around 12 p.m.
with a performance by folk musician Richie Havens
on the 51st St. stage. The full program was amplified
through the streets on large mobile speakers and on a
radio station, WBAI 99.5, that protesters played on
portable radios.

Rosie Perez, Susan Sarandon and Danny Glover and
the Reverend Al Sharpton were some of the more recognizable figures who spoke.
The speakers and the crowd, though in disagreement over certain details, seemed unanimously
opposed to military action in Iraq, particularly to the
notion of a pre-emptive strike. The United States,
they said, is not in any real danger from Iraq.
Several of the speakers and many signs protesters
held expressed opposition to the reign of Saddam
Hussein, as well as opposition to the war, criticisms
of George W. Bush and questioning of his administration's motives.
The day of the demonstration, the White House
announced that President Bush was still hopeful that
Iraq would disarm peacefully.
Over 100,000 U.S. troops are now stationed in
Kuwait.
Turkey, where the United States hopes to mount a
secondary "northern front," has agreed to initial
preparations of upgrades in Turkish bases and seaports. But Turkey has delayed the parliamentary
vote necessary to allow the United States to station

forces there until they complete negotiations over a
multi-billion-dollar aid package and clarify what
their own army's role will be in the event of a war.
The United Nations General Assembly, the U.N.
Security Council and the European Union remain
divided on the issue, withFrance and Russia firmly
opposed to a war without more weapons inspections.
Britain, Spain, Denmark and Italy have all pledged
support to the United States.

Additionally, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had warned
colleges and universities that they were potential soft targets in
the event of a terrorist attack. "We felt as soon as community
members and parents became aware of the alert that they would
likely become concerned over a possible emergency," Bloom said.
To assuage the community's fears, members of the President's
Office, Facilities and Dining Services met last Thursday to discuss possible plans of action in emergency situations. The college
wanted to announce the policies to the entire community in a way
that did not incite fear. "We didn't want to alarm people because
we weren't alarmed," Schall said.
In the end, though, the group decided it would be beneficial to
prepare the campus in case of an attack. "We would have been
neglectful if we had said, 'lt's not going to happen here,'"

Associate Dean of Student Life Tedd Goundie said. "To communicate with the community as a whole was worthwhile."
So while many across the nation were stocking up on bottled
water and duct tape, the college tried to establish a more feasible
plan that would maximize communication between the students
and the administrators.
"We knew the whole duct tape, plastic sheet thing was stupid
to begin with," Schall said. "We wanted to make sure our communication plan was in order in case something did happen."
After Thursday's meeting, Schall drafted the e-mail to students, faculty and staff detailing the college's response during an
emergency. The e-mail stressed the importance of maintaining
channels of communication in the event of an attack or other terrorist-related emergency. A team of college administrators consisting of the president's staff arid members of Facilities and
Public Safety would meet in the Benjamin West House to coordinate the responses. "We will use all means available to us to communicate with the campus, including voice mail, electronic mail
and person-to-person messengers assigned these responsibilities," Schall wrote.
In addition to these communication measures, the college
needed to establish a central meeting place in which to bring the
students together. Bloom explained that the group questioned
"where would be the best location for the community to assemble
given the space required and the need for reliable emergency
power and supplies."
Because of its size and independent power generator, Sharpies
was the logical answer, according to Schall. "We chose Sharpies

ABC program houses talented inner-city students

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY SARAH STANTON

sstantol@swarthmore.edu

Andy Rieger '9l began tutoring at the
A Better Chance girls' house on Chester
Road during his junior year at
Swarthmore to fulfill a personal desire for
community service. Fourteen years later,
he is still working with ABC.
Now, after a few years away from
Swarthmore, Rieger and his wife Lysa
serve as co-directors at the ABC boys'
house and are eager to reacquaint
Swarthmore students with the ABC program.

The seven boys and six girls who currently live in local ABC houses participate in the national ABC program. The
national program's goal is "to substantially increase the number of well-educated
minority youth capable of assuming positions of responsibility and leadership in
American society."
ABC seeks to achieve this goal by placing highly motivated students who live
with difficult social or economic circumstances in locally run ABC programs that
aim to give the students better educational opportunities.
Each ABC program is organized and
funded solely by the local community.
Volunteers make up the board of directors, which coordinates the program,
while others serve as grocery shoppers,

academic advisers or activity planners.
Some people even volunteer as drivers on
weekends, staying up until one in the
morning to shuttle students to movies,
football games and dances. "It's just very
commendable," Anthonise Lewis, codirector of the girls' house, said.
The majority of the program's budget,
which ranges from $150,000 to $160,000 a

year for both houses, comes from individual donations, with other income through
private grants and fundraisers. Local
Presbyterian and Episcopal churches pro-

vide the houses at little or no cost. The

program receives no financial assistance
from the government or Swarthmore
College.
Every year, two girls and two boys
enter the ABC houses as first-years. They
come from as far away as Orange County,
Calif., though most come from the New
York area. The students live here free of
charge until they graduate from Strath
Haven High School. A director and two
resident tutors, who receive free room
and board along with a small monthly
stipend, staff each house. Since students
go through a difficult transition moving
to Swarthmore, the support staff plays a
crucial role in their lives.
Rieger says the transition of moving to

the house is similar to going to college,
except that it takes place at an earlier age
and with additional challenges. "They
have to learn to study, work hard, deal
with majority culture and racism in a
protective environment," he said. The
quiet
suburban
of
community
Swarthmore is so different from the inner
city that it takes a while for students to
adjust, he added. Rieger joked that "the
crickets creep them out in the fall."
At Strath Haven High School, the students generally take rigorous college
preparatory courses. "Their workload is
quite heavy," Lewis explained, but most
students thrive in this challenging environment.
"I love the school," said Jehrad Lamb,
a senior in the boys' house. "It's so much
better than anything I would have had at
home. It teaches me self-discipline."

Almost all of the students plan to
attend college after they graduate, with
recent graduates attending Brown,
Cornell, Pomona and Tufts. Since the program began in 1975, two students have
attended Swarthmore.
In addition to academics, ABC students participate in a variety of extracurricular activities, including the marching
band, cultural clubs and the championship football team. They also have
access to the Swarthmore College athletic
facilities, libraries and music building. "I
don't have a lot of free time," said sophomore Kathleen Regalado, but being
involved in so many activities enriches
her experience at Strath Haven.
computer labs,
This "extra stuff'
fields and clubs that most students take
for granted
give Strath Haven High
School an advantage over most inner city
high schools, sophomore Asia Hoe
explains. "I guess the environment is not
as hostile."
The students, directors and tutors eat
together each night. The cook who prepares dinner holds the only paid position
in the program. "It's a real family kind of
time," Rieger said. Students share news
about their day and discuss current
events.

After dinner, the students do homework during a two-hour study hall the
tutors lead. Although running study hall
and providing some weekend supervision
are the tutors' primary responsibilities,
Ansa Yiadom 'O2 said his main goal as a
tutor in the girls' house was "forging relationships."

Almost everyone involved in the ABC
program cited these relationships as one
of the program's greatest strengths.
Rieger said he was "a poor college stu-

dent" when he started as a tutor and was
attracted to the free room and board. The
best part of the program, however, was
spending extra time with the kids and
becoming an integral part of their lives.
"When these students think of coming
home from college" after they graduate,
Lewis said, "they think of coming here."
The people involved often keep in touch
with each other for years, forming a valuable support network. "After a while, you
start to feel like [the students are] your
little sister or brother," said Kelly Hines
'OL who tutored in the boys' house.
Forming these tight bonds requires
great commitment. Rieger managed to
serve as a tutor while still at Swarthmore,
but Yiadom doubts he would be able to
devote himself as completely to the program if he were still in school. Hines
served as a tutor during her first year of
teaching, which required a tremendous
amount of energy during the day and at
night.
In spite of its benefits, the ABC program faces challenges. Dean of the College

Bob Gross '62, who has served with his
wife as an academic adviser and host family, mentioned some misgivings people
have about the program. "I think there
has always been a kind of moral ambiguity about a program that takes the best students out of urban schools, leaving their
communities the poorer for their
absence," he said.
The program's participants, however,
feel "a responsibility to realize their
potential."
They hope, along with their families

and the ABC national program, that taking advantage of educational opportunities today will help their communities in
the future.

because it's where the food is and it's big," he said. "It has
emergency power fueled by its own diesel-powered generator. When the campus shuts down, it can remain opera-

tional."
As part of the emergency plans, the college has also
overstocked Sharpies with additional food and water,
according to Schall.
While the group established these means of interaction
between the administration and students, the RAs throughout campus received a separate e-mail designating them
the primary conduit of information between the students
and the administration. Goundie wrote that he would leave
all of the RAs a mass voice-mail message and would "try to
reach one RA in each building directly to make sure the
information can be disseminated."
According to the administration's plan, the
RAs are responsible for ensuring that students
are aware of any meeting plans.
"If the decision is made either for students
to stay indoors or for all students to gather in
the dining hall, we will need [the RAs] to bang
on doors to make sure people know, even
though we would notify everyone by e-mail and
voice mail," Goundie wrote. "If phones and email were to be down, a staff person would
come to the dorm and try to locate an RA."
The Deans' Office made the decision to notify parents of the college's plans. "The Deans'
Office asked that it be sent to parents because,
as parents became aware of the federal alert,
they might worry whether Swarthmore was
being as attentive to the situation as we should
be," Bloom said.
Through an e-mail list complied by Susan
Levin, director of parents and stewardship programs, every parent received a copy of the email written by Larry Schall. "When something significant or noteworthy happens at the

college, we like to send a letter out to all the parents,"
Goundie said. "We were worried that parents might just get
snippets of information out of context from their kids."
According to Bloom, parents have been very receptive
to the e-mail. "No parent, to my knowledge, has criticized
our sending the message," he said. "Rather, several parents
have in fact expressed appreciation that we were in touch

and understand their concerns."
In the end, the administration acknowledged that the
chances of an attack or any emergency affecting
Swarthmore are slim. However, the college administrators
still stressed the importance of being prepared. "As far as
emergency preparations go, this is a standard part of the
planning stages," Dean of the College Bob Gross '62 said.
"We're getting ready for many situations, all of which are
pretty unlikely."

Vietnamese film festival shows consequences of war

My Lai."

The East Asian Film Festival began last Saturday with
two Vietnamese documentaries that explored the consequences of the Vietnam War, followed by a question-andanswer session with the internationally acclaimed director of the films, Tran Van Thuy.
The subject of the first film, "Sound of Violin in My
Lai," was the My Lai massacre, which took place in the
Vietnam War. On March 16, 1968, soldiers in a U.S. battalion killed between 175 and 400 unresisting civilians in
the small, rural village of My Lai. An army photographer
captured much of the devastation and horror in pictures.
Eventually, an American helicopter crew, consisting of

the war.

Vietnam army during the war, was poisoned by the herbicide. As a result, his first

son also suffered birth defects and became

Hugh Thompson, Lawrence Colburn and Glenn

The documentary examined how the village continues
to gradually recover from that nightmarish day. The film
also featured Roy Boehm, an American veteran who is
trying to help the healing process by leading the My Lai
Peace Park Project in Vietnam. One scene depicted a
heartwarming reunion between Thompson, Colburn, and
two women that they had saved.
"I was moved by what these men did," Thuy said.
"There were many massacres during the war of which
My Lai was only an example. I chose it as my subject
because it was captured by photographs. I appreciate the

fact that the U.S. is a

The second documentary, "A Story from

misfortune with grace.
"This was what made me want to make

College may end primary distribution courses
Council on Educational Policy would retain distribution requirements but elimiate PDC designation
BY MARY MINTEL
mmintell@swarthmore.edu
By the end of next month, the primary distribution
course (PDC) system that has existed at Swarthmore

since 1985 may disappear entirely.
The Council on Educational Policy (CEP) has been
discussing the problems surrounding PDCs for years.
They recently decided the best course of action would be

to retain distribution requirements
which call for
three courses each in the humanities, the social sciences

and the natural sciences

but eliminate PDCs, which

must make up two of the courses in each category.

"You can be a physics major or
engineer, spend all your waking
hours in Hicks and Dupont and still
not fulfill your PDCs. It's bizarre."
Elizabeth Englehardt 'O5
Before the college can make any curriculum changes,
the faculty must approve them. If a majority of the faculty votes in favor of the CEP's proposal, it will pass.
Provost Connie Hungerford said she hoped the CEP
would "have a proposal to bring before the faculty next

month."
The PDC system may be an example of good intentions
gone awry, Hungerford said.

Initially, PDCs were conceived as writing-intensive
courses limited to 25 people. Their purpose was to help
students improve their ability to express their opinions
and justify their arguments through writing and discussion. But, in reality, PDCs were falling short, according to
Hungerford.

There were "reports from both students and faculty
that there isn't necessarily more writing going on in
PDCs than normal courses," Hungerford said. The CEP
took these complaints seriously.
"If what justified PDCs was its address to writing, then
the fact that PDCs don't always address writing
is frustrating," Hungerford said.
Some PDCs had enrollments larger than 25 students,
while many non-PDC classes were much smaller. Natural

requirement

that a PDC be suitable for both majors and non-majors.
According to Hungerford, many departments have developed two forms of entry for students. For example, the
chemistry department now offers both Chemistry in the
Human Environment and General Chemistry as PDCs.
The CEP has discussed alternatives to the PDC system
that would still stress writing and discussion, including
required first-year seminars and a writing requirement.
They would designate a range of courses as writing
intensive, and students would have to take at least one of

ing economics next semester," he said.

Steven Bhardwaj 'O6 also supported the system, but for
a different reason
the diverse nature of the PDC classes. He said that enjoyed taking classes with upperclassmen, and he disliked the idea of having to take first-year
seminars.
"There seemed to be more diversity of perspective
having all four classes in the room," Bhardwaj said. This
would not happen in "purely freshman seminars based on
writing."

these seminars.

However, not all first-year seminars would be
writing intensive, although many would be. Since
the size of the first-year class would require nearly
30 seminars, for the next few years the seminars
would be "a voluntary program until we know we
have enough seminars," Hungerford said.
Hungerford is not worried that the new writingintensive courses would experience the same problems the PDCs did. "I think it will be a new program
and people will be making a bona fide new start and
talking about what such a course would accomplish," she said.
Many students are enthusiastic about the possi-

ble elimination of PDCs.
Elizabeth Englehardt 'O5 finds the entire system
rather arbitrary. "It boggles my mind that I spent
over half my schedule doing math and science courses my freshman year but I still have a natural science PDC to fulfill," she said.
Englehardt once planned on being a physics
major, and she acquired many natural science credits in her first year. But only one of them was a PDC,
so she will have to take at least one more natural science class in order to fulfill the PDC distribution
requirement.
"You can be a physics major or engineer, spend
all your waking hours in Hicks and Dupont and still
not fulfill your PDCs. It's bizarre," she said.
Englehardt also said the amount of writing in dif-

ferent PDCs varied greatly from class to class and
department to department. "It needs more regulation," she said. "But it's hard to arbitrate, especially
across disciplines."

Housing Committee proposes changes

Additional coed rooms, substance-free housing may be available next year

Lodges, reported

at the most
recent housing committee meeting that there have been no prob-

lems with coed room residents.
According to Westphal, coed
housing has become a permanent
part of student housing. "We've
established that we think it's
important to have in our housing

mix," Westphal said.
While housing committee
members say there is a need for
more coed rooms, not all available
coed housing was utilized this
year. Mary Lyon basement's three
coed rooms currently have singlesex occupancy. Westphal said the
college had chosen these rooms,
the least popular in the housing
lottery, so that anyone who wanted a coed room could have one.
Westphal felt that the fact that
these rooms were not utilized indicated that coed rooms were not
"crucially important" to students.
Yet Sean Brandveen 'O3, a committee member, did not think that
the failure of these rooms to
attract residents meant that students were not interested in coed
housing. He said that he thought
the coed rooms in ML were less
popular because it is considered
less desirable housing.
The committee has not yet
taken the proposal for expanding
the number of coed rooms to the
deans, Westphal said. The proposal also includes converting the
third floor of Dana to an all-female
hall to offer more single-sex
options, particularly to sopho-

mores.
The housing committee has the
authority to make recommenda-

demand,' or 'Why not expand?'
Westphal said the committee
did not know whether more students would want coed rooms, but
that they felt that they had an obligation to expand the option, particularly for sophomores.
Expanding the number of coed
rooms available would primarily
help sophomores get coed rooms,
Westphal said. Seniors usually
occupy rooms in Worth, and sophomores may not want to live in
ML because of the isolation and
distance. Sophomores are also the
class most likely to have room"

'O3 said- "The hardest part is that,
because housing is so sparse,
you'll be putting people who don't
want to be put in substance-free
dorms into substance-free dorms."
The students who proposed
substance-free housing, Mister,
David January 'O3 and Jim Maiolo
'O3, conducted a survey last semester. Forty percent of the student
body supported substance-free

mates.
Although

the
Housing
considered extending
coed housing to the entire campus, Westphal said that she did
not think this would happen
because of admissions considerations.
"A lot of people couldn't apply
if it was all coed," Westphal said.
"We want to appeal to a broad
population; people with different
religions, from different countries. Their parents might not

lifestyle housing.
Dean of the College Bob Gross
'62 was wary of the substance-free
housing.
"In general, we're against programs that Balkanize the campus," Gross said. "Housing that
brings people with different values and ideas together is one of

the more educational tools we
have."

Gross also worried that the
substance-free housing would
cause a concentration of substance-intensive housing in other
areas.
"It is not a prospect that
inspires glee," Gross said.
Many students find substancefree housing unnecessary.
"It's part of the college environment," Becky Strauss 'O6 said.
"A substance-free dorm would disrupt the social environment."
Others, however, support designating a dorm substance-free.
"Students at this college need
to have the option of living in an
environment where students
won't have to engage in actions
that will distract us from our studies," Jerome Fung 'O6 said.
The substance-free housing
will be available in blocks.
Untaken rooms would go back
into the housing lottery.
As with the expansion of coed
housing, the decision on substance-free housing will not take
place before spring break.

ture."

Substance-free housing
The housing
committee
agreed to endorse a substancefree space, possibly in Woolman,
where students would be expected not to drink alcohol or use
drugs while in the hall.
David Mister 'O4, one of the
students who made the proposal,
said that "the purpose of proposing substance-free housing is
that there are students on campus who don't feel comfortable
in an environment where there
are substances. We want to create an environment for residents
who feel this way."
When the committee discussed the subject with the
deans, Westphal said, they said
that they would support the proposal if it required a substancefree lifestyle as opposed to merely substance-free housing. Many
members of the committee did
not agree with this.
"If the deans say, 'lt must be
this way,' and students say, 'We
refuse to accept these restric-

The Housing Committee is
planning to propose that coed
housing by room be extended to
all dorms that do not house firstyears, namely Worth, Roberts,
Woolman and Palmer, according
to Dean of Residential Life Myrt
Westphal.
Coed housing by room first
became an option in the 2001 housing lottery. Members of the college's queer community asked for
coed rooms because they felt that
queer students might be more
comfortable living with a roommate of the opposite sex. Tim
Stewart Winter 'Ol led the effort to
get coed rooms approved by the
deans two years ago.

options were expanded slightly.

Swarthmore student arrested
The protesters were prohibited from
staging a march under a federal court
order when city officials argued that a
march might be dangerous for the protesters. The court ruled they must rally
from inside block-sized enclosures created by police barricades.
This method of crowd control, introduced by Mayor Dinkins' administration in the early 19905, is meant to separate the crowd so that police can control it more easily.
Many

demonstrators were unhappy

with the situation, and though the
protest was mostly peaceful, there were
several clashes with the police. The
police arrested 312 people, organizers
said, charging most with disorderly
conduct and releasing them later that

day.
Among them was Reuben Heyman-

Kantor 'O6, who said he was taken into

custody when he failed to leave quickly

Heyman-Kantor said he was arrested when he told an officer he could not

Heyman-Kantor said he was handcuffed at around 2:30 p.m. at 53rd St.

in a "paddy wagon" police van with 23
other protesters. Heyman-Kantor was
handcuffed without food, water or

Heyman-Kantor said

thought

problems reaching the site of the
protest were the fault of both the police,
for lacking organization, and of those

who organized the demonstration,
because they did not apply for a permit
early enough. He said the reason for his
long detention was that other officers
could not find the officer who had
arrested him.
Heyman-Kantor said he did witness

evidence of the police using force
against the protesters, though he felt it
was the exception to the rule. One man
in the same police van had "bruises all
over his face" and appeared to be "in a
lot of pain," he said.
The man told Heyman-Kantor another protester standing behind him had
reached over his shoulder and tried to
pull a badge off a policeman's coat, and
the policeman had beaten him because
he thought he had done it.
Others in the van who had witnessed the arrest confirmed the story,

said.
The arrests led to complaints by the

Top-Five University

Despite snowfall accumulations of more
than two feet, many professors held class
Monday. Classes at Bryn Mawr, Haverford
and the University of Pennsylvania were cancelled.
Registrar Martin Warner said thatthe decision not to cancel classes is in accordance
with the college's official cancellation policy,
and that the choice lies with individual professors. This is the result of the nature of
Swarthmore's residential campus. "We are a
pedestrian campus," Warner said. "Students
can walk from place to place, and relatively
few faculty members depend on vehicular
transportation to get to work."
The inclement weather policy for staff
and administration differs significantly from
the policy for students and faculty. The policy governing staff states that, on days in
which the college is closed, non-essential
members of the staff are not required to
come to work.
As a result, many facilities and services
were closed on Monday, including Essie
Mae's Snack Bar and the mail room. Some
essential staff members in Dining Services
and Grounds had to stay on campus Sunday
night in order to work Monday morning.

edible, let alone come-again-andenjoy-it food. It was elegantly prepared on plates that not only looked
nice but also matched all the other

The word is tossed around on this campus more than any
other place on Earth.
I've heard it used in situations as innocuous as two people
whispering in Kohlberg Coffee Bar, the sort of jacket a boy
was wearing or the way a girl laughed.
"Sketchy" includes the sense of incompletion and indeterminacy in its traditional meaning, but, when applied to a person as is so haphazardly done here, it is charged with particular values, morphing into a strong condemnation of a disobedient individual as unfit or irregular.

The amorphous nature of the word
"sketchy" allows that particular
characterization wide application in
regulating dissidents.
The amorphous nature of the word "sketchy" allows that
particular characterization wide application in regulating
dissidents. It condemns a range of unspecified transgressions
under the same vaguely defined implication so one can make
the accusation of sketchiness without having to describe the
particular offense or explain why it's offensive. "Sketchy"
obscures the logic behind the community's social norms and
naturalizes their regulation.
The idealization of "The Swarthmore Community" cloaks
the socializing forces inflicted upon the individual student.

Besides using language to regulate dissidents, the community maintains order within its ranks through the public scruti-

ny of the actions taken by the student body.
The social circles of Sharpies and Daily Jolt discussion
forums magnify the smallest infractions to a degree that the
drop of a pin can spark a series of lectures. The morality that
develops is that of the herd; the pious are the vain.
While the community is partly a self-regulating system,
the administration is at the heart of these power structures.
The regular manicuring of Swarthmore's lawns and gardens, while making the campus look nice, also manifests the
presence and control of authority in all sectors of the campus
and at all times.
The liberal alcohol and drug policies are forms of safety
valves that release pressure on the student body; vice is
placed under the control of the administration rather than in

opposition to it.

As students, we are created by an institution, and we also
play a part in its power system as ideological agents. If you
ever consider oppressing someone with the epithet of
"sketchy," you are no more than a tool through which the
institution regulates its opposition.
Next time you hear the word "sketchy," don't scorn the
label. Embrace it.
I'm sketch, damn it! I'm sketch, and I'm proud.
Let's re-appropriate the word, make it ours, and no longer
shall the community use that word to oppress us. The sketchy
of the world unite!

away for the weekend, and I was too busy having rampant
sex all over my room. Crazy, wild, rampant sex. Crazy,
wild, rampant, imaginary sex. And I was good. Good and a

half.

We took my date Kasia's car, because mine, much like
the sex I'm having, only exists in my mind. I did have a
car. His name was James I, he was a 1986 Volvo station
wagon and I loved him dearly. I learned an important lesson from James: "Left turn yield on green." It's possible
that I didn't "yield," per se, and that I "crashed," and that
they had to "tow him away" and that I "cried and cried."
It's also possible Godzilla destroyed him in a battle to the

Look, guys. Though pleasant and enjoyable, this date
was not intrinsically funny. I had a good time, but it
wasn't like one of the employees came over and tried to
steal my left glove, and we got into a fight, and he turned
out to be a ninja master, and ninjas appeared from under
all the tables, and we did battle, and I won. That didn't happen. There was only one ninja. He beat the crap out of me.

We decided we had better get back to Swarthmore
before they realized I was gone and sent out the bounty
hunters again. Suddenly, and without any reference to the
fact that it could perhaps be inserted into this article,
Kasia brought out an engagement band, lovingly crafted
from a 14-karat straw wrapper, and without hesitation simply asked, "Will you marry me?"
After a brief moment of deliberation, I accepted a lifetime commitment with those two words we all long to

You, the reader, are sittin' back, maybe in Kohlberg,

that is what you call yourself), this is it!" Well, calm down
there, killer. I'm pretty sure she didn't mean it, judging by
the laughter. Also, I lost the ring, which, according to
ancient Roman law, means I must battle to the death with
a tiger named Claude. 3 Also means there's no engagement.

remarks about his long-deceased father to get to him, ultimately agrees that spy work is "in [his] blood," and takes
the entrance exam. Passing with flying colors and with
long-legged female distractions behind him, James finds
himself aboard a bus, headed for The Farm.

A closer look at the subtleties of the often underappreciated art of interior decorating

If I didn't pay at least some
attention to decorating my
room, I'd spend my nights in
a bleached-white coffin that
[would push me further

toward (further beyond?) the brink of madness.
Most of my advice is reserved for students who have
singles, since cooperation and compromise are essentially impossible. This is why I recommend an aggressive
strategy in room design. For example, my sophomore

his laundry on the floor like I was doing anyway. Bingo!
I had tricked him into realizing my vision of a boxershort covered dorm floor (i.e., an interior decoration of

Once you've weaseled or waited your way into a single, the fun can begin. Here are some tricks I've learned
over the years.
First of all, for many seniors, the only other person
who will ever enter their room is their significant other.

unacceptable and difficult to find.
Trying to be original in choosing posters on the wall
is really difficult. Any poster that's any good has probably already become a cliche. To counteract this, try

bizarre combinations of cliched posters. Who would
expect, for example, a poster of Eminem next to the
poster of a kitten "hanging in there" right beside an
upside-down anime poster. See? I just made that up off
the top of my head. Creativity is that easy.
When I was a freshman, I bought a poster of
"Clockwork Orange" that was discounted because it was
in Japanese. Even though I had never seen the movie, it
was a pretty good choice. It's given people the false
impression that I'm an exotic, cultured film aficionado
with an alluring dark side. Then, when they learn that
I'm just a boring klutz, we all have a good laugh.
To save money, I've decorated my room with stuff I've
found just lying around, like a hubcap, one of those "You
must be 21 in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania"
notices, hall furniture, exit signs and leftover slices of
pizza. Anything's better than an empty wall, I figure.
Additionally, pillows breed sloth.
To make my room mine, I've tried to do laundry as
infrequently as possible in order to fill the room with
that certain "Eau de Gerrit"™. Plans to cover the walls
with mirrors proved too expensive.
Idol worship, considered "out" for the past 2000 years,
is about to come back in vogue, I think. A fire-breathing
Baal and a sacrificial slab could be a good investment.

Cartoonist Aaron McGruder to visit campus

Creator of"The Boondocks" hopes comic challenges the minds of his readers
BY ELENA CUFFARI

ecuffarl@swarthmore.edu

So what do you do with a degree in African-American
studies and a concentration in social and cultural analysis
from the University of Maryland? If you're Aaron
McGruder, you become the cartoonist of "The Boondocks,"
transition from publishing strips in an independent student
newspaper to being nationally syndicated in over 250 daily
newspapers in less than five years, and speak at
Swarthmore this Saturday.
You also get called things like "The Equal Opportunity
Offender" by The New York Times Magazine (June 24,2001),
and NAACP Board Chairman Julian Bond says that your
"sharp artist's pen combines the biting tradition of Thomas
Nast with the political sensibilities and humor of OUie
Harrington [by] skewer[ing] the powerful, from presidents
to rap stars" while awarding you with an NAACP Image

Award.

But this is only if you manage to "use hip-hop culture in
a multicultural comic strip to address issues of interracial
and intra-racial relations, issues ranging from what it
means to be African American in a white suburb to the
influence of BET to Bush's war on Iraq." As Anna Perng 'O3
and Rebecca Amdemariam 'O3, quoted above, made clear in
their proposal to bring Aaron McGruder to campus, the
Swarthmore community will benefit from exposure to this
uniquely satirical cartoonist and inteUectual.
"We want people to enjoy his talk," Perng said when
explaining the proposal, "but we want to get members of

this community a little uncomfortable, too. What
[McGruder] has to say about race relations, U.S. politics, the
war and Eurocentric education is truly worthy of this community's attention."

If McGruder's own expressed desires regarding his influence come to fruition, then Perng and Amdemariam should
be pleased. In a City Paper interview from November 2002,
McGruder explains, "I think the strip [challenges] people to
think differently, and that for me is more important than to
[it's better] to have people
have people thinking like me
questioning what they're told on a daily basis."
And what better way to challenge people's views on a
daily basis than to write a comic strip?

Forflihe Swarthmore event this Saturday, however,

Olde Club's treasure trove
BY AARON WASSERMAN
awasserl@swarthmore.ecfu
On Saturday, Feb. 8, Dalek was the headlining
act at Olde Club. Wait a second. When you hear the
name "Dalek," perhaps you're not instantly familiar with the band, its sound and its connections to
the scene. You mean you don't know they're the
hip-hop act that started on Matador Records when
Matador tried to get all electro-hop experimental a
few years back? Whose most recent album was
titled, ""From the Filthy Tongues of Gods and
Griots," an album released on Ipecac Records, the
new label owned by Mike Patton of Faith No More
fame; the same Mike Patton who recently has been
palling around with iiber-producer Dan the
Automator in the super-group Lovage with
Jennifer Charles of The Elysian Fields?
Unfortunately, Olde Club's obscurity can
become aggravating for those who aren't pretentious musical, elitist dorks like myself. Yet familiarizing yourself with the Olde Club scene can have
very noticeable long-term benefits, so for those trying to justify penetrating the inexplicably exclusive genre known as "indie rock," take note: Olde
Club is as relevant and cuttingedge as any urban music venue.
If you watched as mud

and, instead, decide to go off-road. They do this to
the song "Wake Up," by The Walkmen, a lazily
splendid quintet from New York City, who, believe
it or not, took time out from their sold-out nationwide tour to play at Olde Club last semester. Need
more proof that this band is worth noting? If you
watched even more bad television this past break,
you would've seen the Walkmen wishing you
"Happy Holidays" on MTV.
Things get better as you move back in time. In
the fall of 1999, the Magnetic Fields performed at
Olde Club right after the release of their album "69
Love Songs." Meanwhile, the juvenile public was
still snickering at the fact that an album had "69"
and "love" in the title. All this happened before The
New York Times was publishing an article every
other week about the group's mastermind Stephen
Merritt and before they were performing sold-out
shows at Lincoln Center. My friend Laura reminds
me all the time about how much she regrets missing that show.
Then there's Cat Power, the performing name of
Chan Marshall, a notoriously fickle musician who
played on campus in 1998. That was before she desecrated the Rolling Stones' "(I Can't Get No)
Satisfaction," had her own music featured in a
series of banking commercials and befriended
luminaries Eddie Vedder and Dave Grohl for
her upcoming, spotlight-demanding
album "You Are Free."
Speaking of free, Olde Club shows are
free of charge with your Tri-Co ID. It's a
cheap way to become a musical snob!
And speaking of Dave Grohl, there's
the Holy Grail of all Olde Club performances, when Nirvana plugged
in on April 24, 1990 (a Tuesday

Cat Power, You Are Free
(Matador, 2003)
Rating: 9/10
Photo courtesy of www.matadorrecords.com

You Are Free
If Cat Power's fan base weren't among the most literate, genteel
and, well, sensitive in modern music, they'd probably be crying "sellout" about now. As if the retro-wank Abercrombie and Fitch
Quarterly-style artwork and a hokey quixotic title reminiscent of
that annoying Baz Luhrman single weren't enough, "You Are Free"
features contributions from passe grungemongers Eddie Vedder and
Dave Grohl. That a backlash is nowhere is testament to more than
just indulgence from the fans or the ridiculousness of the suggestion
in the first place.
For her first release of original material in four years, veteran
songwriter Chan Marshall assembled her most beautiful coUection of
music in at least that long. The opener, "I Don't Blame You," a tunesome plaint with a spare backdrop of ham-fisted piano, whose lyrics
seem directed at some passed rocker or other, is simply one of the
most gorgeous things I've heard in a long time, and its chorus descant
one of the most infectious. After that, Chan pitches things up a notch
with the poppy "Free," which takes a suspenseful moment to kick
into toe-tapping high gear, with an alluringly indecisive drummachine turning the beat around a few times.
Although a few later cuts hearken back to this rockier sound, Cat
Power fans needn't be too apprehensive about a break from the more
somber, moody tone of chestnuts like 1998's "Moon Pix." Ms.
Marshall still channels more of the wailing urgency of PJ Harvey
(and, by extension, Patti Smith) than you can shake a muted-tone,
acid-free-printed stick at; howver, much of the rest of "You are Free"
returns to the downcast folksy style of previous work. Lyrically, too,
things get a lot more unsettled than the first two life-affirming
anthems. Part of what makes the album so successful is its balance:
Dirges like the painfully bleak roll-call-of-tragedy "Names" share
plastic with rockers like the gritty, fast-paced "He War," and both are
better for the contrast. As it turns out, "You Are Free'"s title and stylized artwork are perfectly suited to the encompassing cornucopia of
emotion and possibility contained within. As for Messrs. Grohl and
Vedder (who are credited only by their initials, whether for shame or
modesty or contractual obligations), the former's inventive drumming evenly propels a handful of the rockier cuts, while the latter's
almost unrecognizable harmonies serve as effective, evocative embellishment for two of the most haunting. "You Are Free" is an album
that should be heard and will be appreciated by fans and non-fans
alike.

Shot of Love
Com.a, a UK-born, Hong Kong and New Jersey-raised electronicateur and, we're told, leader of a Japanese "laptop gang" bent on world
domination, takes his moniker from a much-loved Japanese candy.
Fittingly, "Shot of Love," his first release for the U.S.-based
Tigerbeat6 label, is a straight-up, candy-style sort of album. Take the
fantastically awful cover art, a day-glo beachscape with poorly cutand-pasted bikini babes surrounding a creature composed of dozens
of gun barrels and the head of a garbage pail kid. Then there's the earcandy: a handful of saccharine accordionish synthesizer patches,
low-bit drum-machines

palette (which gives the music an
unmistakably Japanese character) Com.a draws together elements of
synth-pop, industrial, Orbital-style melodic trance, carnivalesque
fantasy and tinges of drum 'n' bass into a varied platter that hangs
together nicely as a synthesis of these genres. Most tracks feature a
restrained tonal underpinning
open synth chords or a simple,
repetitive bass line
supporting a prominent synth melody, which
is either challenged or complemented by a battery of frenetic percussion. While the drum programming is accomplished enough to hold
its own next to an Aphex Twin freakout or electroclash rockbox
beatbed retread, the melodies really carry the album. The tinny blipline that opens the reggae-tinged "Fear Farms" builds into a portamento-laden anthem. "Mix Rudegal" layers fragmented vocal snippets and scalar synthwork over a funky-as-heU glitch-house framework, while "Make My Day" is pure sugary retro-'Bos club fodder.
I don't want to suggest that "Shot of Love" is uniformly easy listening: The sonic palette is at times frustratingly limited, and several tracks get pretty grating pretty fast
listeners with underdeveloped sweet-tooths for electronica will probably want to steer clear.

'Joe Millionaire' assault on decency, taste finally over
Sensationalist, deceptive TV show is driving consumerist society further into the ground
BY MATTHEW CURTIN
THE DAILY CAMPUS (U. CONNECTICUT)
(U-WIRE) STORRS,

Conn.
Fox's ridicuhorrendous "reality" show "Joe
Millionaire" came to an end Monday night as
Evan, the $19,000-a-year bachelor, picked the
mild-mannered Zora over Sarah. It was a journey defined by ignorance and shallowness, as
20 women competed for an unintelligent doof
with the single goal of getting at his fictitious
lously

$5O million.

Are the floodgates now open
for countless shows trying to
recreate the "magic"?
Now that "Joe Millionaire" has finally

come full circle, we can look back in disgust
as we realize that those of us who did sit
through the majority of the episodes can
never, ever get that timeback. Americans witnessed the quality of television sink even further as reality television continued its unrelenting assault on the intelligence of its viewing audience. As if that show "Man vs. Beast"
wasn't bad enough, reality programming continues to thrive.
Never before have I witnessed a television
show that I am as utterly disgusted with as
"Joe Millionaire." On so many different level,
it is degrading to the human race. It is like the
worst soap opera or tabloid in the world.
Based solely on sensationalismand deception,
"Joe Millionaire" is instilling the kind of values in Americans across the country that will
only drive our consumer-based society fur-

failed miserably so we could laugh at them?
Well, that is why we are still watching,
because we love to watch others fail.
Everyone has been waiting for the
moment when Evan would tell the winner he
was not in fact a millionaire, but a lowly construction worker making only $19,000 a year.
You could see it in Sarah's eyes when he told
her, and she made it obvious when she was
discussing it with Melissa later on, that the
only reason she continued to pretend she was
interested in Evan was the fact that he was a
millionaire, and once that reason withered
away, she realized she no longer had to pretend.
Being shallow is cool. You probably are.
I'm not, but that is beside the point. So
maybe this is just a way for the shallow folk
to commiserate with one another. Maybe it
is just a sort of support group for the shallow. Watching others be shallow could, in
theory, make one feel better about their
own shallowness. And round and round we
In the end, Zora acted like she did not care
that Evan was a construction worker. In fact,
she was turned off by the fact that he had
inherited the 50 million bones. Talk about
anti-climactic. Will Zora and "Joe," I mean,
Evan, last? I don't really care at all. I hope
they have found true love, because there is
nothing wrong with love. Anyway, this guy is
definitely not a construction worker. He is a
model, and I saw on another show that he was
once a wrestler. The check that they got at the
end of the show made them instant "millionaires," so they got some of the money that
they were after in the end.
Is "Joe Millionaire" a gateway drug? Are
the floodgates now open for countless shows
trying to recreate the "magic"? Let's hope not.

Why do we continue to support this mindless drivel? Do you really care if Zora or Sarah
wins? Do you want either of them to win any-

"Joe Millionaire" is definitely a television
phenomenon in the same vein as "Survivor,"
but hopefully there will not be any copycats in

They are an embattled minority, but they exist.

No one can deny that those of us who, for religious, moral, health or personal reasons choose not
to partake in Swarthmore's classic tradition of
recreational psychoactive substance use, often find
ourselves in sticky social situations. It can be awkward being the only one who doesn't take a swig
from the keg or a hit from the bong. And it is true
that a disproportionate number of Swarthmore
social events depend on alcohol for their excitement.

Of course, this won't excite my friends as much as a big

because some of the people there have a lot of power. A good
chunk of that power lies in determining how schools are

have to meet.
So why should Swatties care? We could start with the tens

Dear Editor:

compete for the chance to come to a place like this (dealing
with the likelihood of debt and burnout) and then face another decade of schooling speaks volumes. Education matters,
and a good education must be an active process. It takes
money and effort and sacrifice.
Here in Pennsylvania, there are about 2.5 million kids
enrolled in some sort of school. If reform doesn't happen now,
it will affect millions more who have yet to enter the system.

These kids don't have universal kindergarten. Many struggle
in classes of unacceptable size. Half failed the last state standardized test. Close to home, students have to deal with the
stresses of privatization in Philadelphia, threats of property
tax revolts in the suburbs, and both in Chester. It's happening
all over the state, in every district and in every classroom.
The politicians know all this. Rendell owes much of his
governorship to promises of education reform, but his support can only go so far, and it remains to be seen how committed he is to the issue. Meanwhile, the legislature is in a
special session. For the next several months people will rally
to keep them focused. We'd love to have you join us, write a
letter or make a call.

We have been more than patient with them. When they
first started up we allowed them to "borrow" our Ws, even
though they didn't even so much as ask us, making
allowances for them because they were a young group. But
now it's been over a year, and the follies of youth are no

Why even bother?
The risks and rewards of engaging in real dialogue at Swat
Imagine a community where people could openly
bring all the facets of their identities (racial, ethnic,
socioeconomic, spiritual, cultural, political, experiential, etc.) to bear upon their daily lives. It would
embody what I shall call "real diversity"
that is,
where people with diverse identities constantly engage
one another for their common benefit. We certainly
have the human resources for such a community here
but, as Randy Goldstein pointed out in his column last
week, it is not yet the full
reality. So how can we
build such a community? I

think that one essential
component of "real diversity" is dialogue where
people bring their identities passionately to bear

upon the topics at hand
while grappling to under-

stand others' identities as

well.
I have glimpsed this

kind of

community

at

KRISTA MARSHALL

Swarthmore, and I do
believe that there is hope
for more of it. However, I

lodized Salt

am personally too often
guilty of not really wanting to try to understand

other worldviews and cul-

tures, of not fighting to love people even when I fiercely oppose what they're saying, of being afraid to really
bring who I am to the table in dialogues, and of not
working to bring about the exciting, challenging life
that could characterize Swarthmore. But I want to try.
So what are the barriers that must be confronted to
bring about real dialogue?
Perhaps isolationism, fear and identity issues contribute to create an atmosphere that discourages real
dialogue at Swat. Isolationism may be our most natural problem; it makes sense that much of our time is
devoted to activities with people with whom we have
common interests, backgrounds and identities. But I
think that everyone loses when we stop there.

letter

to

Moreover, isolationism can lead to complacency,
inability to effectively communicate with people from
outside your "comfort zone" and even ignorance of the
disagreements and struggles going on around you. A
second barrier to dialogue is fear. We may fear others'
opinions of us, possible discrimination against us, the
emotional strain of being the sole defender of an
unpopular viewpoint or the sole representative of a
certain background or even the reality that we may
not have all the answers ourselves. Another serious
barrier to dialogue is the set of risks associated with
truly bringing your identity to bear upon every aspect
of life. We may react so passionately in discussions
that we silence anyone who disagrees with us, be
unsure of our identity and lack the confidence to
express ourselves or be too sure of our identity and, in
our arrogance, grasp "truth" so hard that we can't
examine it. For these reasons, we need a very strong
motivation to risk real dialogue about those things

that we feel define us.
My motivation springs out of my identity as a
Christian and my confidence in an external Truth. By
trying to understand each other's views on their own
terms, we can learn something that can bring us closer to truth together. Furthermore, based on my conception of the fallen nature of man, I think that,
although we are capable of knowing a God who is the
source of all the Truth we can know, we cannot have a
complete grasp on all aspects of Truth (truths, that is)
within this lifetime. I thus have a twofold motivation
for dialogue

not only to convince people, but also to

learn from them.
But is this a common basis for "real diversity" that
could work at Swarthmore? Perhaps we have to each
find our own motivations. Whether our reasons
include simple respect for persons, an intuitive notion
of fairness, a pursuit of non-illusory peace, a desire for

vibrant intellectual life, or something else altogether, I
sincerely hope that we can make Swarthmore a community pervaded by real dialogue that naturally
expresses our real diversity.
Please share your opinions and motivations (or lack
thereof) for dialogue with Krista; you can reach her at

Ring's failure unreported
Dear Editor:
I was shocked to read last week's
article on The Ring's "discussion"
of Feb. 6. Never before have I read
a Phoenix article that so misrepresented the events it purportedly
described.

Several times, The Phoenix
describes the events in ways that
indicate that someone in the "discussion" opposed race-based affirmative action policies. The Phoenix
writes that "most who participated
seemed to favor affirmative action"
and that "many in attendance
agreed that both race and class
should be considered." Technically,
both of these assertions are true.
But they are extremely misleading:

They give the impression that some
participants other than the pan-

elists defended an anti-affirmative
action perspective. In fact, the only
students to speak out against any
form of affirmative action were
panelists Randy Goldstein 'O5 and

Kristie LaSalle 'O6, both of whom
were recruited by The Ring's executive board to do precisely that.
Even they agreed that there should

THE PHOENIX

be affirmative action based on
class.
Furthermore, the article contains no reference to the character
of the "discussion." Presumably
cowed by the righteous hostility
expressed by most of the audience,
LaSalle quickly became almost
silent, turning The Ring into a freefor-all consisting of an angry, mono-

The Ring was given
over wholly to
pro-affirmative action
speeches.
lithic audience versus Goldstein.
No one ever explicitly attacked

Goldstein's character, but no one

expressed the slightest sympathy
for his point of view. No one even
asked Goldstein to explicate his
position
every question posed to
him was sharply critical.
Eventually, Goldstein asked for

members of the audience who supported his views to speak up. No

one responded. Perhaps I was the
only person in the audience who
even felt sympathetic toward
Goldstein's position. Or perhaps
the others, like me, simply didn't
relish the idea of going up against
80:1 odds on such a charged issue.
Shortly thereafter, Goldstein gave
up and refused to say anything

more, claiming that he would "just
prefer to listen."
For the last half-hour or so, The
Ring was given over wholly to proaffirmative action speeches, without any pretense that an alternative
point of view was being represent-

ed.

The article did not mention any
of these facts, instead preferring to
paint a picture of a civil discussion
in which multiple viewpoints were
represented. The Ring has been a
productive vehicle for dialogue in
the past, and I hope that it will be so
in the future, but this time dialogue
failed. Why did the article white-

wash this fact?

Red, Black
and Green
What's up with South Carolina? Why does it insist upon
flying the Confederate flag? Don't the white folks of South
Carolina realize that that symbol of white supremacy is as
offensive to black folks as the Nazi swastika is to Jews? The
NAACP has raised these questions by boycotting tourism in
the state until the Confederate flag is removed from state
capitol grounds. South Carolinian whites have compromised
by removing it from the capitol dome and flying it elsewhere
on capitol grounds. The boycott persists.
Here we see Johnny Reb, Confederate counterpart to
Uncle Sam, standing in the arena that is South Carolina,
waving the Confederate flag as a
matador. The NAACP is his buU.
He keeps that "colored people"
distracted as it charges at him
with a boycott of sound and fury
impotence.
signifying
The
NAACP, as a protest organization, plays the bull very well
The whites claim that the
Confederate flag isn't about
white supremacy, but rather
Southern heritage. Fine. More
power to 'em, so long as there's
more power to blacks to wave the
Red, Black and Green flag of the
TARU TAYLOR
UNIA (Garvey's Universal Negro
Improvement Association).

As

Huey Freeman
Garvey put it, red is for the
"color of the blood which men
must shed for their redemption
and liberty," black is for "the color of the noble and distinguished race to which we belong," and green is for "the luxuriant vegetation of our Motherland." Let the Stars and Bars
fly alongside the Stars and Stripes. But let the Red, Black and
Green fly as well.
The issue is equal representation. If the whites want to
honor their Southern heritage via the Confederate flag, then
let us honor our African heritage via the Red, Black and
Green. If a man can pledge allegiance, to the flag, of the
United States of America, and at the same time honor secession and rebellion, Uncle Sam vs. Johnny Reb, then surely a
man can pledge allegiance, to the flag, of the United States of
America, and at the same time honor no. 39 of our Magna
Carta, "The Declaration of Rights of the Negro Peoples of the
World," adopted August 13,1920, "That the colors Red, Black
and Green, be the colors of the Negro race."

Let's see the Red, Black and Green
atop Its own flag post.
While the NAACP protests white Southern heritage, the
UNIA affirms black African heritage. It is telling that the
former has no flag of its own. The Confederate flag has its
own flag post on South Carolina's capitol grounds. Fine.
Let's see the Red, Black and Green atop its own flag post.
John C. Calhoun, the white South Carolinian who authored
the doctrine of states' rights and was the intellectual leader
of Southern secession, has a monument on state capitol
grounds, as do many other heroes of Southern white heritage. Fine. But let's see monuments of Marcus Garvey,
Malcolm X and Denmark Vesey, the black South Carolinian
who rebelled against slavocracy, on those same grounds.
Let's see black heroes equally represented alongside white
heroes.
I don't begrudge the Southern whites their beloved Stars
and Bars. Unlike the NAACP, I don't stand against Southern
white heritage. Like the UNIA, I stand for African black heritage. The Stars and Bars and states' rights is about
Southern whites not being tyrannized by the Yankee
Northeastern establishment. Insofar as American blacks are
Booker T Washington's "nation within a nation," i.e., a
"black community" constituting a state within these United
States of America, the Red, Black and Green and states'
rights is about blacks not being tyrannized by the WASP
establishment.

I hate Saddam Hussein. He's a vicious tyrant who
slaughters his own citizens, attacks his neighbors and
works on developing weapons of mass destruction that
could threaten American cities. But as bad as the Iraqi
dictator is, and as much as I would like to see his head
mounted on a stake in the White House Rose Garden, I
must admit that he does have one very important
virtue.
He is not French.
The French have invested a lot of political capita
into ensuring that Saddam can go about his busines
unmolested. As far back as 1998, the French ambassa

much of a distinction nowadays. Proliferation has
reached the point where crackpot dictators, the Disney
corporation and my crazy uncle Ed all have atomic
weapons.
There are no compelling reasons for the world community to care about what the French think, but, somehow, it does. The fact that this pony-eating, deodorantshunning folk have managed to cling to power against
all the odds is impressive, and suggests that all the
jokes about World War II might be missing the point.
Who cares if French tanks can only run in reverse?
They don't need to fight us in order to keep us from acting effectively.
How can this problem be dealt with? Invading
France is probably out of the question. As much fun as
it would be to send the U.S. Marine Corps into Paris as
a practice run for the assault on Baghdad, administering the country after the war would drive even the most
dedicated, professional military governor into mad-

ness.
Fortunately, French diplomacy just might carry the
seeds of its own downfall. If their rudeness and stubbornness could transform Colin Powell into a hawk,
who knows what else it might accomplish? The international community has not united behind the notion
that Iraq is dangerous enough to justify a pre-emptive
invasion or the idea that Iraqi violations of U.N. resolutions justify war, but they might be able to get behind
a coalition based upon opposition to France.
The leaders of the European countries who signed a
pro-war statement didn't do so simply out of their faith
in George W. Bush. They have a good reason to distrust
France. If the French are as good at gaming the E.U. as
they have been at gaming the U.N., then inside of 20
years most of Europe will be under the Gallic thumb.

Poland and the Czech Republic want economic integration, but they spent most of the past half-century
taking their marching orders from foreign bureaucrats
and are probably not too keen on repeating the experi-

ence.
In some ways, subordination to the French could be
even more humiliating than subordination to the
Russians. The commies were brutal and repressive, but
at least they weren't snooty. Even if "New Europe" is
not actually enthusiastic about the prospect of a war in
Iraq, they should be able to recognize that taking
France down a notch or two is good policy.

ideology trumps AIDS aid
As much of our federal budget hurdles toward defense
spending at top speed, the administration is playing it
suave. Bush threw a neat little token into his State of the
Union speech: an emergency plan that commits $lO billion
to AIDS relief in Africa and the Caribbean.
The plan sounds appealing: It provides drugs, education, doctors and laboratories to 14 African countries as
well as Haiti and Guyana. The drugs will cover two million people, and "education" and care efforts will be
extended to an estimated 10 million. That's 10 million people who would otherwise have died of AIDS, right?
Wrong. The shiny new
AIDS plan may simply be an
excuse for not supporting
other, international efforts to
fight AIDS
efforts that
might work a whole lot better. Bush's new aid strategy
conveniently

circumvents

the GlobalAIDS Fund (previously the primary mecha-

MAYA SCHENWAR
Swat Meets World

nism for AIDS relief), which
is committed to distributing
generic drugs and condoms.
In a State Department memo
released on Saturday, Bush
maintained that all AIDS
relief money must be kept
separate from "family plan-

ning" services (i.e., contraception). The administration

has frozen millions of dollars for World Health

Organization programs to combat AIDS, since they promote condom use, and has reduced worldwide condom
donations by 63 percent. (Bush is, after all, the guy who
has made abstinence-only education a national priority
and advocated laws requiring parental consent for purchase of contraception.)
Countless studies have shown that the condom is the
best weapon against the AIDS epidemic in Africa. It's also
a lot less expensive than AIDS cocktails. And wouldn't it

February 20, 2003

be better for patients themselves if they hadn't contracted
HIV in the first place?
One also wonders what the Bush plan's AIDS "education" will entail. As governor of Texas, he promoted abstinence as the solution to the global AIDS epidemic. The
efforts of the current United States Agency for
International Development emphasize "behavior change
programs," like a costly mass media campaign in
Zimbabwe that includes a slew of infomercials and the
award-winning music video, "Abstinence is Cool." A
sweeping celibacy initiative may sound like a good idea
but has telling peoI mean, yeah, no sex means no STDs
ple not to have sex ever proved an effective strategy to
combat anything? If abstinence talk did the trick, we
would've rooted out syphilis BCE. It's like the constant
surgeon general's reports telling Americans to eat less fast
food. (In case you needed an update, heart disease is hardly waning.) Talk can only go so far, especially talk that
condemns the very mechanism most helpful in fighting

AIDS.
Moreover, by bypassing the Global AIDS Fund, Bush is

no longer committed to providing cheaper, generic versions of treatment drugs. This swings the door wide open
for big pharmaceutical company lobbyists to cash in on
AIDS patients, sucking up more money for less treatment.
In his State of the Union address, President Bush proclaimed, "Millions are facing great affliction, but, with
our help, they will not face it alone." This may be true, but
as that great old tune from "Free to Be You and Me"
reminds us, "Some kind of help is the kind of help that
helping's all about, and some kind of help is the kind of
help we all could do without." Face affliction alone?
Sanction-starved Iraqi orphans, Venezuelans struggling to
build a democratic government and Afghan cluster bomb
victims would probably be glad for a little less of our company, thank you. And if the new Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief means $lO billion diverted from other aid funds and
fueled into "Celibacy Rocks" TV, Zambians, Tanzanians
and Haitians just might agree.

competed against some of the best collegiate runners in the nation last weekend,
earning valuable experience in a tune-up

before

the

Centennial

Conference

Championships. The Tide more than held
their own against Div. I, 11, and 111 opponents
the
at
Boston University
Invitational, nearly breaking several of
Swarthmore's indoor school records.
"The trip was definitely a success; almost
everyone set personal records," Elizabeth

Gardner 'O5 said.
Gardner set a personal record in her
split of the 400-meter relay and placed
17th in the 800-meter run. Her time of
2:2121 in the 800-meter run nearly broke
Swarthmore's indoor school record. "My
goal is to run under 2:20 in the 800,"
Gardner said.
Besides the prerequisite pump-up
music
ranging from Outkast to Cher
runners attributed their speedy times to a
superior track at the Valentine's Day
meet. "The track at BU is brand new,
ramped and a lot of fun to run on, so times
are generally faster," Gardner said.
"Their track has a few advantages, it
being banked and having more than three
lanes," Sarah Hobbs 'O6 said. "But it is
really good to be back sharing the field
house with 34 other sports."
After running her first track event just
a few weeks ago, Hobbs is four seconds
away from breaking the school record in
the mile. Hobbs finished the event in
5:2L93, good for 27th place. "I came in having never run track before, so my only
real idea of the sport was run fast and
turn left
but it has been really fun and
I'm really glad I decided to run," Hobbs
said.

Fellow freshman Paul Thibodeau also
had an impressive performance at the
meet. He finished in 26th place in the 800meter run with a time of 2:00.9. "It was
really fun to compete with some of the
most competitive runners in the country," Thibodeau said.
Senior big man Robert Melick finished
ninth in the shot put championship with
a throw of 12.78 meters. "I beat all of the
Div. 11l guys, and I beat a few Div. I guys,
which made me happy," Melick said.
Matt Williams 'O4 has been thoroughly
impressed with the team's progress thus
far. "The team has more determined athletes on it than I can remember, and this
is my third year of track," he said.
Lately, the track team has needed a
healthy dose of determination, spending
Valentine's Day on the road, battling bus
failures and dealing with the congestion
of athletes in the field house and the
inclement weather conditions. The team
returned home at 5 a.m. on Sunday after
their bus failed on the way back to
Swarthmore. "Our driver was used to
driving trucks. He tried to put [the bus] in
gear, and the drive shaft collapsed. It was
not a pretty sound," Melick said.
After the blizzard this past weekend,
the distance runners continue to practice
outdoors. "As for those kids who find
space by running outside in the freezemy-nips-off weather, they are an encouragement to the sprinters, and I think they
know that," Williams said.
Despite the adversity, the team is
excited to continue training and competing as the season winds down. In the next
two weeks, they'll be competing in a
Haverford
Invitational
and
the
Centennial Conference Championships.
"We are hoping to get to both meets without the bus breaking down. If we do that,
I think the sky is the limit," Hobbs said.

Men's hoops vie for playoff spot
Garnet split with Hopkins,
Ursinus to keep hopes alive;
Chris Loeffler injures knee
BY ERIKA DOYLE

edoylel@swarthmore.edu

Winning does not make players. It is the other way around.
Players sweat to make the victory. The 14 men on the
Swarthmore basketball team smeared their opponents' sweat on
the court of Tarble Pavilion as a mark signaling their tremendous triumph. The Garnet battled their way to glory on
Wednesday, defeating conference rival Johns Hopkins, 71-50, for
the first time since the 1996-97 season. On Saturday, however,
the squad could not secure a victory, as they fell 70-48 to
Ursinus, the only undefeated team in the Centennial

Conference.
Surrounded by family, friends and supportive fans on senior
day, the Garnet's fall to Ursinus was somewhat cushioned, lessening the conference blow. Blair Haxel 'O5 led the Garnet Tide
with 16 points, and Matt Gustafson 'O5 added 12 points with 5-of-7 shooting, but it was not enough.
Ursinus leapt out to a 16-5 lead to start the first half but the
Garnet fought back with six Haxel points to close to within 1614. The Bears growled with a 14-3 run to counter, as Dennis
Stanton scored seven of his game-high 27 points.

"This late in the season, every game is
critical, and to beat a quality team like
Johns Hopkins gives us great confidence."
David Pearce 'O3
"We just gave up too many easy baskets in transition, and
Dennis Stanton had a great game, and there wasn't much we
could do to stop him when he's hitting triples from 24 feet with
someone on him," Haxel said. At the half, Ursinus stood with a
comfortable 13-point lead at 36-23.
In the second half, the Tide battled their way back into the
game, cutting the lead to seven at 48-41 after a Matt Gustafson
triple with 11:49 remaining. "We kept it very close until the latter part of the second half. After being as close as 48-41, poor
transition defense and some missed shots opened the gap for
them, unfortunately," Jim Dalton 'O6 said.
Earlier in the week, the Garnet had broken a five-game losing streak to Johns Hopkins dating back seven years. Gustafson
scored 25 points, hitting 9-of-13 from the field and 5-of-6 from the
line. Scoring another 24, Pearce combined with Gustafson to
give Swarthmore 49 points and secure the Conference victory
over Johns Hopkins (15-6, 6-4). The Garnet Tide shot 53.1 percent
(6-of-49) for the game and 58.3 percent (14-of-24) in the second

half.

"As was the case in most of our other wins, defense was key,"

co-captain Pearce said. "We were able to play solid team defense
and make our shots at the offensive end. We are a tough team to

beat when we do those two things." With this crucial conference
win under their belts, the Garnet claim sole keeper of second
place in the Centennial East Division, one game ahead of both
Haverford and Washington.
It is often said that most good things in life are attained with
some tradeoff. This proved true for Swarthmore, as the squad
paid a heavy price for its conference victory over the Blue Jays.
Chris Loeffler 'O4 seriously injured his knee, possibly tearing his
medial-collateral ligament. As a result, this multitalented forward will be out for the remainder of the season. Swat will have
to adjust with some crucial maneuvering in order to compensate
for its loss in the inside. "He's an impact player for us, and we'll
have to adjust if we want to continue to win," Dalton said.
With only one game left in the regular season, last week's
Johns Hopkins win has come at a crucial time when the team
needs the extra force to drive it to the end. The Garnet look at
the Johns Hopkins victory as a motivational push to help them
see it through with their best efforts to the very last game. "This
late in the season, every game is critical, and to beat a quality
team like Johns Hopkins gives us great confidence," Pearce
said.
The Garnet's last game will take place Saturday at 3 p.m.
against Swarthmore's strongest rival, Haverford, to determine
who will pass the elite gate into the conference playoffs.

Sniderman snags national bid
BY EMILY CONLON
econlonl@swarthmore.edu

No, the participants are not just old ladies who play in
their gardens. Hailing from Quebec, Canada, Andrew
"Stobo" Sniderman 'O6 can tell you from nine years of experience that badminton is not a sport to be taken lightly. With
what his female teammates called "unbelievable skill,"
Sniderman captured the men's title in the Northeast
Collegiate Tournament last Sunday.
While men's badminton remains a club sport with
Sniderman as its sole member, he decided to enter the tournament to get a little exercise. "I played about 10 hours a
week during the badminton season, but I hadn't played a full
match since Canadian Nationals last April," he said. "I
thought I should come out of 'retirement' for the tournament, since it was on campus. I had forgotten how much I
love the game and how fun it is to compete."
The rustiness of his game did not show as the first-year
easily defeated his older competitors. Sniderman played four
matches, challenging men from Drexel, Albright and

Howard Universities. The final match between Sniderman
and a top-ranked Howard player, who was "at least six inches taller," according to Stobo, proved to be in Sniderman's
favor. Winning the best of three matches, 15-7; 14-17; 15-5,
Sniderman credits his skill more than his physical
endurance. "I'm in the worst shape I can ever remember
being in. In the second game, I'm sure it showed. I was real-

ly sucking wind and was playing impatiently, trying to force
points."

But while Howard put a win in the second game,
Sniderman already knew the outcome of the match. "I've
been playing for a long time, and I could tell by the way the
others moved and stroked the shuttle that I was probably the
most skilled player there. When coach Loomis realized I was
so ridiculously overconfident, he was like, 'Andrew, one
match at a time.'When I lost the second game in the finals, I
must have scared him. But I knew it was in the bag. I justhad
to focus in." Support was high for Sniderman as the women's
team cheered him on. "Jeremy Loomis and the team were
awesome, too. They gave it their all on Sunday and were then
kind enough to lend me their support," he added.
Sniderman stole from his Howard opponent an automatic
bid to the badminton nationals, and he now looks to prepare
for the Mid-Atlantic Regional Tournamentthis Friday. From
Sunday's competition, Sniderman learned what he should
focus on to be successful for Nationals. "I played in the tournament for fun. I knew I wouldn'tbe nearly at the level that
I am capable of being at, but hey, I missed the game. This
tournament gave me some fun matches. Now, maybe I should
get in shape, or something," he said with a smile.
When asked to predict the outcomes of his future competitions, Sniderman generated an easy answer: He will win.
"I'm Canadian, and badminton is just one of the many areas
in which Canadians dominate when they come to the States,"
he said. Perhaps on Friday Sniderman will bring home a win

for Swarthmore College and for Quebec.
Three more Swarthmore players qualify for Nationals
Swarthmore College hosted the 2003 Northeast Collegiate
Badminton Tournament last Sunday. Among the teams that
traveled to campus were Howard, Haverford, Bryn Athen,
Albright and Drexel. The Garnet put up a fair showing,
qualifying three team members for the National
Tournament.
Receiving national berths were Wuryati Morris 'O4 and
Ay Jy Phoun 'O4 for the women's doubles event and Jessica
Larson 'O6 for the women's singles event. A bid to Nationals
goes to those players who qualify to at least the quarterfinal
game during the Northeast Collegiate Tournament.
Morris and Phoun overtook teammates Liz Leininger 'O4
and Sachie Uchimara 'O3 in a three-set match to boost themselves into the final quarterfinals. They fell in the quarters
to eventual champions, Howard's nationally ranked Amy
Nguy and Sara Vang. Jessica Larson made a great debut at
the Collegiate, advancing to the quarterfinals at the tournament.

The Garnet Tide earned second place overall with 29.5
in the sport, won the
top spot.
All three Swarthmore team members, as well as men's
club team member Andrew Sniderman 'O6, will head to the
2003 OCBC/Yonex U.S. Open Badminton Championships in
San Diego Florida on April 25.

the talent she has. She's just a pure shooter."
Last night's game against Muhlenberg was senior
night, as the team honored Furman's final regular-season
home game.
"Ali is a great leader, not only because she's the point,
but she has this sense of being in charge," Lee said. "As
with all great three-point shooters, she can put us back
into the game at any point. She's so consistent. Two hundred in a career is so incredible."
Fellow point-guard Farrelly has spent her rookie season
behind Furman in the lineup, taking the opportunity to
learn from the three-year starter.
"Throughout this past year, she's been a mentor on the
court for me," Farrelly said. "Ali has taught me a lot about
the game, about playing point for our team.
"It will be tough not to have her next year. She definitely has had an impact on the way I play."
Furman had little to say on the subject, preferring to
focus on the importance of the game itself. "Hopefully, I'll
be able to look past [that it's my final home game] and get
the win," she said. "I can reflect on it later."
Before the game, Furman talked of the importance of
continuing to play team ball. She said that head coach

Adrienne Shibles had been stressing the importance of
controlling the boards and picking up transition defense.
"We're really prepared for Muhlenberg," Furman said.
"I feel more prepared for this Muhlenberg game than I
ever have."
While both Swarthmore and Muhlenberg have locked
up playoff berths, the Garnet needed a win last night to
keep the possibility of a home court opening round alive.
The team had mixed views on the importance of homecourt advantage in the playoffs, some talking of a hard
road through a hosting Johns Hopkins.
But Lee talked more of the mental lift a win over the
'Berg would bring to the team. "The importance of the
game is more proving to ourselves that we can win a big
game," she said. "It would be the morale-boosting victory
going into the playoffs. We really need that to feed offof."
The last playoff prep step for the Garnet is Saturday's
regular season finale at Haverford.
"It's nice to end the season with the rivalry," Furman
said.
Lee explained, "Haverford will be ready to play because
it's their senior game, and a win for them would make
their season. But we're not the kind of team this year that
takes teams like Haverford lightly."
Tip-off is at 1 p.m., with the men's game to follow at 3
p.m.

and three steals to finally eclipse the CC all-time steals

Determined to regain their team-ball-oriented game
the Garnet traveled to CC East Ursinus. Havin

Swarthmore was looking to refocus on "the littl

"It was a great game," Furman said. "We played we

"We knew what to expect from Ursinus," rooki
point guard Debbie Farrelly 'O6 added. "We definitel
surprised ourselves a bit just with how well we playec

Swarthmore finished with four scorers in double

"Everyone was able to make a contribution, whic
is always nice," Farrelly said. "We moved the ball rea

Playing 22 minutes from the bench, Farrelly had 1
