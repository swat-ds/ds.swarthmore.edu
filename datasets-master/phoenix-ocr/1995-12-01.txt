Faculty Approves CEP's Plan To Reorganize
College's Interdisciplinary Study Program
The faculty approved major changes
for interdisciplinary study at the College
proposed by the Council on Educational
Planning (CEP) on November 17.
The College divides its academic program into departments, programs, and
clusters. Departments are disciplinary
and offermajors or minors. Programs are
interdisciplinary units which offer special majors, minors, or concentrations
and have their own faculty members.
They include Computer Science, Dance,
Education, Linguistics, and Theater.
Clusters, formerly known as concentrations, are interdisciplinary units which
confer degrees as either concentrations
or minors and do not have their own
faculty members. Clusters are more flexible than minors because they are also
open to those not in the Honors program.
The College's clusters include Black
Studies, Computer Science, EnvironmentalStudies, German Studies, International
Relations, Interpretation Theory, Peace
and Conflict Studies, Public Policy, and
Women's Studies.

There are also interdisciplinary majors which do not have their own faculty
members and include Asian Studies,
Bioanthropology, Biochemistry, Education/Psychology, Literature, Medieval
Studies, and Psychobiology. Asian Studies has been considering redefining itself
as a cluster since it was able to attract
more students when itoffered concentrations in the past. Similarly, Literature
and Medieval Studies, which used to be
concentrations, have now become interdisciplinary majors.
The motion currently under consideration deals with clusters alone. CEP has
also considered reforms in the definition
and funding ofprograms, but at its October 5 meeting, it shifted these reforms to
long-range planning. The current proposal was prompted by an evaluation of
concentrations conducted by the CEP in
May, which found that the needs and
resources of clusters were changing.
Clusters were originally envisaged as
temporary interdisciplinary programs
which would expand the College's academic offerings and encourage collaboration inscholarship across departmental

lines. Black Studies, created in 1969,
became the first Concentration.
Whereas in 1981, only nine students
completed a concentration as a part of
their studies, by 1994, that number had

departments has often led to an awkward
search for a 'home' for courses." This
motion allows clusters to offer both introductory courses or capstone seminars
under their own label.
The manner in whichclusters are evaluated is also subject to change. There was
previously no evaluationperiod for clusters; once formed, there was no official
way to dissolve or modify one. Now,
clusters must be reviewed and renewed
every five years by the Curriculum Committee. If warranted by student interest,
clusters may apply to become either interdisciplinary majors or programs.
The third part of the motion involves
funding. The CEP is requesting $65,000
to make these clusters more stable.This
money would fund up to two courses per
cluster in a given year taught either by
existing or non-Swarthmore faculty, a
reduced teaching load for the convener
of the cluster, and funding for clerical

climbed to 68, a full 20% of the graduating class. The popularity of these offerings reflects a nationwide move toward
increasing interdisciplinary study. The
motion presented at the November 10
faculty meeting gives clusters more autonomy and money, ensuring their consistency and coherence.
The report stated that, "It is not untViot i«
fr,r
jy valued by a [cluster] to be seen as marginal
by a Department," and consequently, clusters have had difficulty offering classes
which suit their needs.
A cluster previously could offer no
other courses under its own name than a
capstone seminar, a culminating exercise emphasizing the cluster's theme.
Until now, all classes excluding these support.
seminars had to be under the jurisdiction
This motion will most likely make
of an academic department. The report clusters a more visible part of the curricufound that "the inability of [clusters] to lum, allowing them to expand and belist interdisciplinary courses outside of come more independent.

Campus Group Exposes Nigerian Atrocities
By Jessica Harbour
Jude Uzonwanne '9B, a native of Nigeria, has been committed to the ideal of
forming a stable democracy in his country for a long time. In his application to
Swarthmore, he wrote, "The need for
democracy is the greatest and most important need Nigeria has today; I have
decided to dedicate my life to seeing that
need fulfilled in my own small way."
Therefore, the shock was even worse
when he learned that nine prominent human-rigfyts activists, including 1996
Nobel Peace Prize Nominee Ken SaroWiwa, had been hanged by the Nigerian
government. Inresponse, Uzonwanne has
been doing all he can to spread news of
the execution across campus and rouse
student support for the CoalitionAgainst
Dictatorship.
The nine men were tried on the charge

of inciting the murder of four chiefs of
Nigeria's Ogoni tribe. However, most
observers agree that the trials were more
or less a farce. "Half a dozen prosecution
witnessesadmitted they had been bribed,"
wrote Newsweek reporter Joshua Hammer, "and Saro-Wiwa's entire defense
team resigned after continual harassment." Sentenced to death on October
30th, the men were executed on November 10thafter thedecision was upheld by
the Provisional Ruling Council, madeup
of many of Nigeria's senior military leaders. The executions took place justfortyeight hours after the PRC's final decision. An immediate international outcry
arose; South African leader Nelson
Mandela called the executions "a heinous act" while several nations withdrew
their ambassadors from Nigeria. Additionally, the World Bank canceled its
support for a $lOO million loan.

IC Groups Consider
Change of Venue
By Wendy Kemp

Toward thebeginning of this academic
year, the Intercultural Center instituted
structural changes that affected its thro?
constituent organizations: the Swarthmore Asian Organization (SAO), the
Hispanic Organization forLatino Awareness (HOLA), and the Lesbian Bisexual
Gay Alliance (LBGA). While each group
used to have its own space, now all three
groups are housed in the same combined
rooms. Since SAO has grown larger than
expected, some ofits members have suggested that it move somewhere else on
campus.
One of these rooms is designated as
the study room. The room in the middle,
adorned with bookshelves filled with literature pertaining to each of the organizations' interests, is the library. Fernando
Chang-Muy,Director of the Intercultural
Center, also uses this room as his office.
The last room serves as a combined support space for the groups.
Chang-Muy explained, "We wanted
to restructure and organize the rooms to
make sure thatthe room arrangement had
more of a functional purpose than that of
ownership. Now the rooms are all shared,
and any of the three groups can reserve
them."
However, SAO meetings haverecently
become so crowded that the group is
contemplating the advantages of looking
for a larger space. Chang-Muy said, however, "it might be because the seniors,
who remember what it was like to have a
room of their own, strongly feel that it
should be that way again. The freshmen,
sophomores and juniors don't seem to
mind this [the present] arrangement. The
seniors are the ones who are most strongly
advocating wanting a room of their own."
Opinions on the issue vary widely.
Thomas Ta '96 said, "Whatever is ulti-

mately good for the SAO is fine with
me...1 personally want the SAO to stand
on its own without the need to be associated with the IC. [There's] nothing wrong
with jutiiouatiun. but our commonalities
with the other groups are limited."
LBGA member Becca Hover '99 believes that the new use of space is beneficial. She said, "I see how groups could
want their own spaces, but I think that it's
more important that we have group space
where we can network and communicate."
Franklin Rubinstein, Secretary of
HOLA, said, 'The majority of people
were willing to give [the new room ar-

rangement] a try last year. In some sense,
I think it's more functional now, but if
[SAO members] wanted to leave their
mark on the big room, they could do so."
He added that it was "not likely that there

wouldbe other space" whereSAO mem-

bers could meet. He noted that even if
each organization regained its own small
room at the IC, this would not alleviate
the problem of not having enough space
for people coming to meetings.
It is very clear that the proceedings are
still in the first stage; in fact, the decision
on whether or not to move has not even
been posed officially yet. "The matter is
still being discussed in the group," Intercultural Centerintern Tf»m Doan '9B said.
"And I know that the student Intercultural Center board is still discussing the
issue as well." Ta said, "At this moment,
progress has been very slow."
There will either be a meeting this
semester or next to discuss these issues
further. It is uncertain where SAO could
move, since there is no known campus
space available at the moment. "I hope to
have a meeting with the SAO leadership
and membership soon to talk about possible models and alternatives," ChangMuy said.

Saro-Wiwa, a playwright and poet as
well as activist, put most of his energies
into protesting the treatment of the Ogoni
by the government and by ShellOil Company. Shell has been mining up to forty
percent of its oil from the Niger Delta,
where the Ogoni live, since 1958.
In the past, this mining has led to
numerous environmental problems; over
a fifteen-year period, an average of four
oil spills a week occurred in the Delta
region.
"There's no question that Shell, the
dominant investor in the oil-rich parts of
Nigeria, has enormous leverage over the
Abacha government ifthey choose lo Ui >
it," said Timothy Burke, Assistant Pro
fessor of History. "There's also no doubi
in my mind that Saro-Wiwa was ex
ecuted in part to keep him from further
agitation against Shell's activities in
southern Nigeria."

On November 30th, the Coalition
Against Dictatorship sponsored two
screenings of the CBC film, "Delta
Force." The film documented the atrocities committed by the Nigerian government, led by GeneralSani Abacha, against
the Ogoni people-the burning and raiding of villages in the summer and fall of
1993, for example, that left 750 people
dead and 30,000 people homeless. Using
graphic footage shot after the raids and
smuggled out of Nigeria, the film provoked strong reactions from the audience. It also raised the question of Shell
paying the Nigerian government to wipe
out Ogoni opposition to oil drilling, quoting from an official memo referring to
Shell and "financial resources."
After the film's first screening, both
Uzonwanne and Wale Ashiru, a native of
Nigeria now living in Philadelphia, spoke.
Ashiru, in particular, detailed how gov-

try. Schools and universities have been
forced to close while the hospitals are

filled with outdated or useless equipment. "If you go to a Nigerian hospital,"
he said, "and you get out, it is because
God said, "This is not the time.'"
Uzonwanne also spoke of the urgency
of the need to enforce measures against
Abacha's dictatorship. In particular, he
said, international sanctions must be imposed; the assets of prominent Nigerian
military officials and civilian leaders allied with the government should be frozen and other countries must stop importing Nigerian oil."These three things
must happen within the next eighteen to
twenty-four months," he said, "or else
the military government will only get
stronger." However, he reported, the top

Profs Weigh Pros and Cons of Liaisons
By Kate Bernstein
While some of the College's academic
departments have opted for student liai-

sons and special student groups to facilitate communication between faculty

members and students, many departments
have considered such measures unnecessary.

The Provost's office has no general
guidelines or expectations about student
liaisons, although they do encourage
larger departments to explore the idea,

which a number of them have. The English department has three student liaisons who carry out informal interviews
with job candidates to provide an alternate mode of assessment. Jeff Severs '96
said, "It's been a constant experience in
tempering my personal excitement over
a particular candidate's interests or ideas
coinciding with my own and a concern
for the general needs of the studentbody.
However, I've learned enough about the

Giddings Explains Rise of the Right
By Erica Turner

Author Paula Giddings gave a social
and political history of the United States
as a basis for understanding the current
status ofAfrican Americans, women, and
the rise of the political right in her lecture
Monday evening.
"My objective is to empower people
with information...by helping [them] to
understand how the world got to the way
it was," Giddings said in an interview
after her lecture, "Race, Women and the

Rise of the Right."
"We tend to think the world is [the way
it is] because of individualfailure. When
[you] begin to understand the dynamics
of racism and sexism you become empowered. It...gives a sense of inner
strength," Giddings said. Giddings her
self is interested in African American
women. "Where did Black women seem
to fit in history?" Giddings said at the
beginning ofher lecture. She outlined the
difficult time African American women
had joining both the Women's and the
Civil Rights Movements.
"The hypermasculinity of the movement split women from men," Giddings
said of the later part of the Civil Rightr
Movement. At the same time she ex-

plained how the Women's Movement

focused on middle class Caucasian
women. In effect, Afro-American women
were outsiders in both of these movements.

In her lecture Giddings used examples
like the Voting and Civil Rights Acts of
1964, the Brown v. Board of Education
decision, the defeat of the Equal Rights
Amendment and the Roe v. Wade decision to explain the status of women, races
and the rise of the political right today.
"I thought it was a good general over\icw of how we got to where we are,"
Amy Albert '9B said.
CUddings said in her lecture, "We are
where we are today not because of failure
bui because of success, and conservative
re iction to that success."
An example of this is the success of the
Civil Rights Movement, becauseofwhich
"[George] Wallace was forced to code
his racism," Giddings said. Thus, the
success of the Civil Rights Movement
led to the use of racial coding.
In another example ofhow liberal success has led to conservative reaction,
Giddings explained how conservatives
learned to control the issues that affect
members of different racial groups and
women. Giddings quoted the Heritage

Foundation, a conservative think tank, as
reporting, "[T]he secret to victory has
been the control of these terms [equality
and opportunity]."
Despite the rise of the Right and its
current control of political terms and
issues, Giddings still holds hope. "There
is tremendousracism and sexism in society, but we can be prepared to counter
that," Giddings said. "I measure the possibility of change by the strength and
coherence of the people to fight against
it."
Assistant Professor of Religion Yvonne
Chireau introducedGiddings, giving testimony to the strength and coherence of
Gidding's own efforts to change theracism and sexism in society. "For me your
work was and continues to be a powerful
legacy," Chireau said.
Giddings is the author of two published books. When and Where I Enter:
The Impact ofBlack Women on Race and
Sex in America and In Search ofSisterhood: Delta Sigma Theta and the Challenge ofthe Black Sorority Movement.
Giddings visited Swarthmore for two
days, speaking to classes and giving a
faculty lecture as well as the general
lecture, as part of the Phi Beta Kappa
Visiting Scholar Program.

"What the Coalition is currently pursuing is to raise awareness, organize boycotts ofShell Oil company products, ask
our different schools to divest from Shell,
and pressure the American government
into imposing oil sanctions on Nigeria,"
said Uzonwanne. "We plan to organize
demonstrations in conjunction with

Campus Discusses Police Brutality Arboretum Accredited Committee
Narrows Search

The Swarthmore CivilLiberties Union
hosted an informal dialogue on police
brutality in Trotter Wednesday. Only two
of the four scheduled speakers showed
up—Hattie McCuttheon andGlova Scott,
both from the International Concerned
Family andFriends ofMumiaAbu-Jamal.
McCuttheon spoke first, using the case
ofAbu-Jamal as an example of the unfair
manipulation of power by police officers. Abu-Jamal, an African American
journalist and political activist, is currently on death row after being convicted
of the murder of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981
McCuttheon believes that Abu-Jamal
was framed because ofhis political activism even though much of the evidence
directly contradicted what the prosecution had stated. Additionally, prosecution witnesses have changed their testi-

The Scott Arboretum received official
accreditation as a museum by the American Association of Museums (A AM), an
honorbestowed to only 746 of the 8500
museums nationwide, earlier this year.
The Arboretum is considered a museum for several reasons: it curates the
College's collection of plants, has staff
and assets management, and interprets
the collection to the public.
According to Arboretum Director
Claire Sawyers, the two aims of the Arboretum are to care for the plants and to
record which plants constitute the collection.
The AAM bestowed the accreditation
honor after a lengthy process to determine whether the Arboretum had met its
criteria for a museum. The process of
recking accreditation was self-initiated

does not believe it is possible to reform
thepolice which is why she is a socialist.
She feels that as long as the police can be
controlled by money and big business
interests, corruption will prevail.
Although he recognized the importance of the issue, David Slavin, an adult
attendeding the lecture, did not believe
college students not directly affected by
police brutality wouldcommitthemselves
to the cause.
Several students and adults in attendance said that they feel strongly about it
simply because others are suffering. Others said they had encounteredpolice brutality in their experiences and that it is a
"real"issueof utmost importance to them.

the panel, said, "Police brutalltj is a

McCuttheon put the case in the context of the broader problem of police
brutality. "We don't think that what has
happened to him is unique. Meaning that
Mumia, just like many, many young
African American men, systematically
end up, in the city of Philadelphia and
throughout this entire nation, [being unfairly treated by police and the justice
system] simply because of the color of
their skin. The difference with Mumia is
that he has chosen to fight this police
frame-up, this police cover-up, unlike
the other victims on death row."
Scott said police brutality against
blacks. Latinos, and other minorities
perpetuates oppression and divisiveness.
It affects whites as well; the misuse of
power is directed against all working

The Biology department may be getting too popular for its own good.
While biology majors make up roughly
one seventh of each year's graduating
class, only one in every 14 Swarthmore
professors teaches the subject, according
to Associate Professor and department
chair Rachel Merz. The disproportionate
number of majors leads to lotteries for
upper-level courses, crowded seminars,
and fewer opportunities for close contact
with professors, she said.
"For the long-term good of the College, the department can't continue to do
this," said Merz. "On the other hand, we
haven't collapsed yet."
Biology professor and Associate Provost Mark Jacobs said that while groups
such as the College Planning Committee

and the Council on Educational Policy
are beginning to consider redistributing
faculty among departments, it's unlikely
significant changes will take place be-

"our guiding principle up till now
has been to try to keep the distributionof
faculty divisionby division fairly equal."
The Biology department might try to
reduce the number of majors—either by
increasing the minimum grade average
required of majors or by asking the Admissions Office to accept fewer potential
biologists—if the College doesn't give it
more faculty, Jacobs said.
Biology major Molly Jacobs '97 said
the department shouldn't limit the number of majors: "If there's that big a demand, they should hire more biology
professors."
It's hard to balancenumbers of profescause

sors and students because enrollments

fluctuate Mark Jacobs said. "We don't
have aright to think...that we're going to
be a popular department forever."
In the short run, said Merz, the
department's staffing crunch will not go
away. For one thing, Associate Professor
and Associate Chair Barbara Stewart,
who also serves as Health Sciences Advisor, plans to retire in August, but no
one will replace her until the fall of 1997.
Merz wants Stewart's replacement to
work full-time for the department, instead of two-thirds time as Stewart does
now. But since the CEP has only just
begun considering the issue, the department cannot hire someone for next year.
Stewart spends the remaining thirdof her
time as premedical advisor. Associate
Dean Bob Gross said a replacement will
definitely be found by next fall.
If searches to fill teaching positions

fail, the department could face a real
crisis, Merz said. The department is seeking one-year leave replaoements for Professors Jacobs, Tim Williams, and Kathy
Siwicki, but temporary positions can be
hard to fill because many top candidates
take tenure-track positions at other
schools, she explained.
The College also needs to hire a replacement for Professor Jacob Weiner,
who is leaving in June for a job at the

■

Royal Agricultural University in
Copenhagen, Denmark.
Stewart's and Weiner's departures
came as surprises to the College, Merz
said. Stewart was expected to retire next
year. Weiner didn't announce his decision to leave until late October.
Stewart, a 1954 graduate of the College who's taught here since 1967, plans
to write a mystery when she retires.

Student Council Platforms
Appointments Chair
Andrew Lund '99
Hi, my name is Andrew Lund. I'm a
first-year student here at Swat, I live in
Willets, and I'm running for Appointments Chair in your Student Council.
This position is extremely important and
I feel thatI am the best candidate for the
job. The job includes the responsibility
of sending out announcements through
all-campus mail and organizing Appointment Committee deliberations.The Appointments Chair is also responsible for
recommending to Student Council which
students should be named to the various
committeesformed under the auspices of
Student Council. In effect, it is up to the
Appointments Committee to make decisions regarding who will represent YOU
in campus government.
Obviously, this is not a position for
someone who has little time or little experience in dealing withissues and people.
Furthermore, it is necessary for your Appointments Chair to be someone who is
not afraid to stand up to people when he
or she sees something that is possibly
detrimental to the student body. I believe
that I am the candidate that embodies
these virtues.
For four years in high school I was a
member of student government. I was the
Freshman ClassPresident and the Sophomore Class Vice President. During senior year, I was the Vice-President of the
student body. This position entailed the
normal activities ascribed to any official
of high school student government, but
beyond that, last year was the fortieth
anniversary of my high school and I was
the Student Chairman of the committee
that administrated the anniversary-related
events. All of these things have allowed
me to become used to organizing meetings and events, solving disputes, and
making some difficult decisions regarding many issues.
My vision for the next Student Council
and my role in it is twofold.First, I think
that it is extremely important that the
Council makes an effort to have more
contact and interaction with those that it
represents, you the students. To illustrate
this point, let me give you an example.
Recently the Student Council developed
a committee to address the inflexibility
of the meal plan. Personally I feel very
strongly thatthe meal plan options should
be expanded, and I'm sure that I'm not
alone in that sentiment. Unfortunately,
few of those affected by this issue were
aware that it was even being discussed. I
propose that once a month, a member of
the Student Council will hold a dormwide meeting at each dorm on campus.
This will give Council members the ability to know more clearly what their constituents wantand expect and will also be
a method for disseminating information
to thestudents. I feel that this is important
because Student Council is only as powerful and effective as the students allow it
to be. The more aware and galvanized the
studentbody is, the better Student Council will be able to meet their needs.
Finally, I hope that the Appointments
Chair, whoever it turnsout to be, is tough,
yet fair, when determining the people
who represent the students. I hope that
this person is able to put aside personal
preferences and make decisions that will
benefit Swarthmore. I also hope that the
Chair will be able to stand up and not be
afraid of declining the appointment of
those who they feel would be poor
choices. I know that I can fulfill these
hopes, and if you feel that the role of

Appointments Chair requires these attributes, I encourage you to vote Andrew
Lund for Appointment Chair.

Charter Chair
Sean Barney '9B

I am concerned about the integrity of
Student Council as an institution at
Swarthmore. The Council cannot serve
its proper and vital function of representing student interests unless the Council is
able to command the respect of both the
student body it represents and the Ad-

ministration with which it must work.
The Council will only command so much
respect as it deserves from the student
body, and only so much as it demands
from the Administration. Unfortunately,
Student Council has not been insistent
enough in demanding a substantive role
in administrative decision-making, al-

lowing theAdministration to make policy
impacting upon students' immediate financial security, and upon their longrange goals, without true consultation
with student sentiment. It is no wonder
that the Council is not regarded by the
student body as a functional agent for its
representation. I run as a serious candidate seeking serious change.
The issue of chartering, and, thus, of
funding of student organizations is a vital
one to the health of our intellectual community. The power of student council, by
way of this function, to improve the social, cultural, and political dialogue on
campus has gone largely unrealized. It is
time to take a long, hard look at the way
in which decisions of who gets chartered,
and for what reasons, have generated a
stagnant intellectual environment in
which there is too little debate and too
much empty rah-rah-ing for the latest

undeniable cause.
Why as a student body we find ourselvesrarely rocked by fundamental controversy, and why we rarely tackle issues
that challenge us, in ways that might
make us consider our own preconceived
notions of truth, is ultimately linked to
what organizations are considered worthy of official recognition and support.
The robust exchange of ideas that is the
true mark of aninstitution ofhigher learning can only be expected where there is a
sincere policy of respect for opposing
and minority perspectives. I will fight as
Charter Chair on behalf of those fledgling organizations who challenge conventional wisdom or official interpretations of the appropriate here at Swarthmore, and who thereby attract resistance
along the path to recognition.
Ifyou look within yourself and believe
that Student Council can, and should, be
the voice for an increasingly voiceless
student body, then I ask you to cast your
vote for me.

committee can make these type of binding recommendations highlights the importance of student representation on
administrative committees. These issues
hit the two most central issues on this
campus: effective and genuine student
representation and the drive to get the
information that the council receives out
to the student body.
Working to increase the studentvoice
on campus has been a central initiative on
my first year on Council. As both CoCoordinator and Appointments Chair
over the past year, I have made efforts to
increase thepresence of students in committee structure both in number and capability one of the centerpieces of my
work on Council. From these efforts, the
Council has been successful in getting
information to and from the administrative source. Now, that we have successfully established these lines ofcommunication and possess vital information, it is
imperative that we continually develop

more effective ways of passing that information to students. Beyond this, our
role is twofold: getting the student reaction back to the proper administrative
person or committee and actively lobbying to persuade the administration to incorporate our view point in their future
plans for the college.
In order to increase our awareness on
campus issues, SC needs to work closer
with ThePhoenix so studentsknow what
type of issues are being discussed, hold
personal gatherings between students and
the Council, and have a suggestion box
on the SC Board for campus ideas. Also,
as a member of the Council who is on the
CPC, I would actively solicit suggestions
on where we think the college should be
in the long run by using personal contact
and working through the organizations in
whichI have the most contact on campus.
I would also encourage other members to
do the same and give me their suggestions which I could then pass on to the
CPC. Identifying needs in the student
populace, and persuading the CPC to
look at this perspective will be my top
priority, and I continue to guarantee my
110% commitment to this initiative.
Finally, any member who runs for
Council should not forget the fact that
there is also a commitment to the Council
itself. I would continue to make time
available so that I can participate in the
Council and see its work continue. I would
especially like to be on the Outreach
Committee which would allow me to
grapple with the issues that surround
increasing communicationand ways for
the Council to be more active. This component is key to our success. If we are not
perceived as being a legitimate and active body among the students and for
students, then we have no base from
which to draw support for any of our
actions. We will be incapacitated from
thebeginning. Our success demands continuedrevitalization and reinvigoration;
we need to continue to find new ways of
putting studentsback in student council.

Do you know who your Student Council members are or do you need to be
reminded by the friendly Parrish bulletin
board? What exactly does Student Council do and how are students involved in
its decisions? Many Swarthmorestudents
do not use the Student Council to its full
potential because they do not know what
the Council's role means in the community.

problem alone, I do have the experience
and the passion necessary to influence
changes in the way our Student Council

SC and Administration need improved communication

the bookstore. The administration, in the meantime, has ostensibly sat back and been content to

education, making sure in the process that we

on issues

haven't gotten ourselves into too much trouble
mucking about with student issues. For the most
part, then, they've left the running of day-to-day

college life to the student body.
The resulting decentralized decision-making
structure has certainly had its good points
we as
students decide which organizations get what
money, we have a large amount ofcreative control
over student-related events like orientation, and
we even managed to make the mass ballotreferendum look like a political feasibility when we got
together and decided to put a flag on top ofParrish.
There have always been downsides to the lack of
administrative involvement
when's the last
time the College managed to put together, or even
attempted to put together, a large student-oriented
event? We're pretty much dependent upon the
resources of SAC and the connections of students
(see Dave Matthews finding his way here) for the
organization of studentactivities. But for the most
part, we've contentedly run things ourselves without administrative interference, relying upon our

own initiative to decide our own fate and create
our own free-time activities, and we've managed
to maintain a reasonably cohesive college community in the process. We should feel pretty
happy about ourselves.
But increasingly, there has been evidence that
our college's loose-knit administrative structure
may not be living up to the Quaker ideal. For
example, one hears more and more grumblings
among students that the overabundance of student-run committees are just window-dressing, in

existance merely to legitimitize administrative
decisions. Some paint the picture of an administration that increasingly decides student issues by
itself, largely ignoring student input. This is one
of many issues that needs to be brought to the
forefront and finally addressed by the administration why even bother to have committees if the
administration is going to run roughshod over the
committees' efforts to effect policy change?
On theother hand, many studentbodies dohave
considerable power and resources at their disposal. And the most pressing problem that then
emerges regarding Swarthmore's dual decisionmaking process is an incredible degree of miscommunication, with a good amount of aimless
bureaurcacy thrown in for good measure. Even
though there is often a great push for change on the
part of the studentbody, little gets done as student
committees and administratorsretrace each other's
steps and spend entirely too much time in subcommittees. Students and administrators seem to have
a basic inability to get together and make the
changes that the student body wants and the college needs. It's an absolute mess. Don't believe
us? Let's look at a case in point: Student Council
and the attempts this semester to finally change
the student meal plan.
If there is one complaint that seems to arise
repeatedly at Swarthmore, it's the remarkable
lack of options in our college's meal plan. Students who live on campus must use the mealplan,
which is only offered in a2O-meal-a-week format.
Food isn't offered anywhere close to 24 hours a
day at a college where studentspull all-nighters on
a weekly basis, and if you miss a meal, you've lost
your credit, and can't reuse it at a later date. While
there are reasonable justifications for these aspects of the Swarthmore meal plan, the lack of
meal plan options is glaring, particularly when
compared to other colleges. Indeed, discontent
with themeal plan is large among the student body
according to a recent Phoenix poll, 66 percent
of those currently on the meal plan think itneeds
to be significantly changed.
When confronted with a persistent problem
affecting the studentbody, combined with such a
clear consensus for change. Student Council did
what seems to come naturally to them these days
create a committee. This in and of itself isn't a
bad idea, but what resulted was four months of
miscommunication and largely wasted time as
Student Council and the administration talked in
circles and Swarthmore students endured another
semester of an antiquated meal plan.
A quick glance at the Student Council minutes
gives us a first glimpse at what the Meal Plan
Committee has been up to. Afterabout a month of
meetings in which it was decided thatthe committee needed to talk to administrators, as well as
Renato's and the Co-Op, discussion about the
issue continued on and on. Henceforth, the minutes reveal that the Committee was "working on
alternate meal plans", or the minutes note that the
committee gave briefreports on its progress at the
Student Council meeting. At some meetings, the
Committee's progress wasn't revealed at all. At
one meeting, members of Student Council asked
themselves if they were perhaps going too fast and
overextending themselves. At the next meeting,
no representatives were present from the Meal
Plan Committee (October 18).
Of course, these antics would only be somewhat comical, and not really cause for concern, if
the Committee was getting things done behind the
scenes. But in fact, after meeting with the administration, the Committee went off to interview 12
other schools to find out what their meal plans
were like, steps already taken by the administration in their meal plan research.
An exasperated high-level administrator told
ThePhoenix that Student Council "came in once,
and then I never heard from them again." He
further noted that instead of working with Dining
Services in theirresearch, StudentCouncil wanted
to go off and do everything themselves. He stressed
that changing the meal plan is largely an issu<* of
trade-offs, and that the administration is happy to
make these trade-offs if representatives from the
studentbody decide they want them. However, in
spite of the fact that student committees come to
talk to him about the issue (as well ather issues)
every year.little ever gets done. "We need to do it
together. We wantto work with student representatives," he said, but there is "no working structure" in place to achieve change.

Basically, we have an administration that is
eager to work with the student sommunity, and
yet finds no cohesive representative body willing
to work with it to achieve results.. We also have a
Student Council that does try to take up s'udent
issues, but views the administration as unresponsive to its concerns. Therefore, even though bp'h
sides are willing to modify the meal plan, they
work largely on their own, fail to communicate
with each other, and nothing gets done year after

year.
In fact, it was only just this week, after three
months of talking (and this isn't the first semester
the meal plan has been an issue), that the administration and Student Council decided that they
both were willing to work on modifying the meal
plan. Another, broader student committeeis therefore finally going to be convened to "consider the
specifics of a new meal plan."
The meal plan fiasco is a timely example of the
problems inherent to the decision-making process
at Swarthmore. Student issues often don't get
adequately addressed due to what one administrator terms a "large gap"between the administration
and student representatives. And the above mess
is what happened with an issue that students feel
pretty strongly about, confront every day, and for
which parents dish out over $3OOO a year.One can
only guess how many other issues, perhaps ones
that aren't at the forefront of students' concerns,
never get acted upon. Perhaps inevitably, this
inaction breeds an atmosphere of disenchantment
they quite reasonably
among the student body
don't believe eitherStudent Council or the administration is able to get things done on their behalf.
Only 14 percent of those polled this week by the
Phoenix felt that the meal plan was ever going to
be changed.

We therefore first need to make sure the issue
doesn't sit around in committees for the next
coupleof years. The Board of Managers will be
talking to students today about changing the meal

plan. We implore theBoard of Managers to exercise their authority and do what they can to accelerate the process of modifying a system that a
strong majority of the student body, as well as
parents and alumni, has deemed in need of change.
But this is a problem bigger than just the meal
plan. As the aforementioned administrator noted,
we have to find a way to "bridge the gap" between
the administrationand students. The point isn't to
assign blame to the members of the Meal Plan
Committee, who, in fact, seem well on their way
to defying the 84% of the student body who didn't
expect any change in the meal plan. Rather, the
responsibility falls upon the shoulders ofboth the
administration and Student Council to inject a
little life and credibility into an increasingly decrepit decision-making structure at Swarthmore.
Almost certainly one way not to improve the
situation is for the current trend of unopposed
Student Council elections to continue. (As of
now, four people are running unopposed in the
upcoming week's elections, and there is one position with no one running at all.) But even more
pointedly, we urge the administration and Student
Council to begin seriously examining the way
decisions affecting students are made at
Swarthmore. The recent unresponsiveness, miscommunication and gridlock is deplorable and
unnecessary. It's time they together take steps to
guide us back towards the committee-based,
communitarian decision-making process envisioned and instituted at Swarthmore over a century ago by our Quaker founders. And perhaps
most importantly, it's time the administration and
Student Council find a way to work together to
effectively bring about needed, student-related
change on our campus.
Statistics are 90% significant with a 95% error.

in order anyway. It is certainly arguable
that the atrocities of the Balkan conflict necessitate intervention on moral grounds, but that leaves
the door open for a thousand more dire situations
that call for similar aid. Anyone feel like trying to
draw a line?
The answer to the vital-interest question, in
essence, is no; there are some pretty good reasons
why we should be there, among them that the
formerly warring parties have specifically asked
the U.S. to intervene, and while your columnist
supports the idea, he understands why some others are troubled by the lack of an articulable goal
for the U.S. presence in the Balkans. In principle,
he sides with Bill; in theory, he wants the mission
to succeed enough that he can overlook these and
other factors. But when he reads the New York
Times, he can't help but be reminded of the
practical obstacles to an effective mission, and all
the administration's good intentions seem
like just so many paving stones, if you follow
your columnist. He has trouble explaining
why this mission should turn out any more
smoothly than Somalia or, well, Vietnam,
and why the American public is suddenly
sold on the idea that a few casualties are all
right in the grand scheme of things. If this
particular president were slightly less prone
to following popular opinion around like a
dog chasing its tail, your columnist wouldbe
a little more confident that the U.S. troops
sent to Bosnia would at least have a chance to do
what they've been told. As it is, he has a feeling
that the mission, as currently conceived, is doomed
from the start.
Better ways to do it? A bit less ofa free hand to
the troops (more guidelines that spell out unacceptable stuff), a bit more sense of what we're
aiming for and when it'll be accomplished, and a
whole lot more honest assessment of the risks and
drawbacks so that failures, when they do come,
will not be a surprise. More importantly, the
troops will need aims more concrete than keeping
"

compromises together and ensuring that people
are

happy; the diplomatic

team

might have ac-

knowledged the difficulties of enforcing the nebu-

lous middle ground.
Again, your columnist supports the idea; he
thinks that, on balance, the U.S. probably should
be part of the peacekeeping force. But he cannot
endorse this particular plan as wholeheartedly as
he might iike as long as its ultimate aims (it
assumes that the work of the outside world will be
doneafter a year or so and that arming theBosnian
Federation will solve future problems) remain
unclear or dubious.
That the motivating force is generally commendable should not distract thereader or viewer
from the flaws in the current plan, flaws that may
render its mission impossible—to overcome the
suspicions of a public deeply averse to the threat
of casualties, the president will have to somehow
demonstrate the differences between thisand past
foreign-policy failings. There are no good answers in the Balkans; the current proposal is the
best idea out there, but its flaws endanger the
status of peace in the countries it affects, and
makes it less likely that any accord agreed upon
will last.

I made no attempt to defend
or debase Farrakhan.
Brus has taken my words severely out of context
to meet his own self-aggrandizing ends.
Hie very nature ofhis words leads me to believe
that he was not even at the meeting where my
"contemptible" statements were uttered. And if
indeed he was there the messages brought about
through the serious discussion of pertinent issues
were completely loston him. My "hapless defense
of racism", as Brus puts it, was nothing of the sort.
The intentions of my comments were simply to
contextualize, nothing more, nothing less. I made
no attempt to defend or debase Farrakhan, or his
statements. All of the people present at thediscussion, including myselfagreed that what Farrakhan
said was wrong. Nevertheless, I fear that Brus
misconstrued my comments to suit his own ends.
Brus attempts to use my statement to facilitate
his grandiose views on the dynamics of race
politics in this country. From the opening lines of
his article to the senseless "fact" based tirade
about the disintegration of the black family. Brus
attempts to make a parallel between thesemisconceptions and my comments. However, there is
clearly no such parallel. Brus's actions were craven to say the least, and they are the mark of a
person who lacks the wherewithal to deal directly
with things and people he takes issue with.
If Brus found my statements so problematic,
why didn't he discuss his opinion of my comments with me person to person? Or, as he states
in his article, was the "grim earnestness of my
tone too downright chilling" for him to approach
me.
Apparently, his only recourse: to plaster my
name all over The Phoenix. What saddens me
most is that Brus's article gives credence to the
statement that "We aren't even on the same planet".
If the only thing that Brus can gain from the forum
discussion is a license to criticize, then I think the
need for more forums on race matters and cultural
communication is desperately urgent.

To the Editors:

I am writing to express my annoyance and
embarrassment at the venerable Swattie habit of
just getting up and leaving in the middle of concerts, talks, and other special events. We were
treated to an extreme example of this inconsiderate behavior thislast Sunday afternoon during the
second concert in the 'ThreeStellar Woman Jazz
Pianists" series, featuring Michelle Rosewoman
and Quintessence. The performance was indeed
stellar and had audience members shimmying in
their seats to the band's upbeat, funky sound and
Caribbean spice. Unfortunately, at least half the
audience showed their appreciation for the performers' energy and skill by getting up and leaving the LP AC before the end of the concert
Yes, I and therest of the Swat community know
you were regretfully taking off to write those two
papers and a problem set that were due last week,
but please for a moment expand your thought
process beyond our own skewed social protocol
and consider how your actions must have looked
to our guests. Even those who may not have
shared my enthusiasm for music should have
considered staying until the end.
Folks, this was an opportunity to take advantage of a professional concert by a well-known
group of fabulous jazz musicians, not a casually
interested strollpast some guy strumming a banjo
in thepark. Think: if we had to pay $25.00 to see
the same concertat the Academy of Music, would
we be walking out? The fact that we can see
amazing performances like this for free due to
good ol' Quaker values, the generosity of the
William J. Cooper foundation, the hard work of
the concert series organizers, and the exposed

passion and soul of the performers themselves
should motivate attendance beyond that of hardcore jazz enthusiasts, but should not allow even
thebusiest of Swatties to feel they can belittlethe
caliber of the event
Sunday's audience exodus did not go unnoticed. The continuous opening and shutting of
theater doors between each piece prompted the
charismatic Rosewoman at one point to inquire,
"Anyone out there?" Later in the concert a fidgety
six year-old behind me who managed to sit still
longer than many Swatties announced in vocal
consternation, "Where's everyone going?" In my
opinion it was frustration with our bizarre and
unexpected audience behavior that inspired
Rosewomen to abandonher piano and letit all out
on those poor congos in the last piece. Please,
Swarthmore—get up before noon to do your reading, so when you go to a concert, you can stay.

Taste, Integrity, and Shattered Glass

Through the centuries Michelangelo
venerated by all, and replicas of
David were not uncommon. But in nineteenth century America a penis in public
display offended all men of good taste
who believed that women and children
should not be exposed to such disgrace,
and a figleaf covered it from view even
though all that the concealment did was
to draw attention to that spot of shame.
Among today's intellectuals, for the
most part, this is seen only as a comical
interlude in the history of Western art.
But in the larger world of common people

Margaret Helfand, '69, although her name
is rarely printed anywhere, even in the
Alumni publications, when the building

the glass believe nevertheless that she
has produced a building whichotherwise
is elegant and attractive, they should trust
her choice of glass since she undoubtedly

Public opinion can break a good architecture; but it never makes one. I say this
on the basis ofmy intimateknowledge of
at least a thousand finest buildings, old
and new, all over the world, and I humbly
admit my ignorance on subjects other
than architecture. One single mind must
oversee a design in order assure its cohesion and integration. The furor over the
art glass so far has failed, then, to recognize the integrity of thebuilding as a total
design; and if it hastily decides to have it
taken down, it will then fail in its own
integrity. In this age of multiculturalism,
at a place like Swarth-

There are two separate issues with the glass.

male or female. The public believes that

it reserves the right to conceal or even
eliminate whatever it does not approve
not only for the benefitof the community
but for the posterity as well. With a majority behind it, it claims toknow what is
good for them and for all others. Those
who hate the art glass in KoHberg Hall are
no exception, even though they are hardly
a majority since those who like it don't
raise their voices and we don't hear their
words. It is easier, too, I suppose, to
ridicule faults in others than praise their
merits; and they make better news, we
are sometimes told.
There are two separate issues with the
glass. One concerns taste, and the other
integrity. I, for one, happen to like the
glass; and I like the colors, too. These

colored windowshave a striking range of
timbre and tonality, now bright and intense, now subtle and even somber, depending on the angle of view and the
condition of light. It is, therefore, hardly
surprising that those who dislike the windows express their dislike variously; some
think they are garish while others say
they are drab. Some knowingly suggest
brighter colors
like red, blue, and
yellow in the style of the 30's modern a la
Mondrian; others as knowingly propose
that more somber colors should do better
amber, ruby, and tobacco brown, per-

haps more Victorian a la Butterfield or
Art Nouveau a la Tiffany. Many favor no
color; this is surely easier to imagine
visually than alternative colors. To me,
these are the colors of spring blossoms;
they bring joy to the campus where everything is serious and grim, both academically and architecturally. Most
people like most colors if they appear on
flowers, dresses, or ties. This is glass, not
flowers, they say. How about glass flowers?They draw a good crowd to Harvard's
Peabody Museum!
My taste, to some, is questionable, to
be sure. But it is, of course, none of the
business of anyone else. It is personal.
But, then, so is everybody else's. Gusta
non disputandem, so some professors
say; some like it hot, I say, or some prefer
nettles according to the translation by
Tanizaki Junichiro retranslated into English. A personal taste, then, should not
parade as a judgment of quality. Saying I
like itis not the same thing as saying it is
good. Everyone knows that, of course.
But in the matter of taste I happen to
believe that it is not quite altogether per-

sonal. Taste, being personal, ill qualifies
as a standard of judgment with regard to
decisions in matters of design, unless it is

a cultivated one, like that of those people
who have been devoting years of their
lives to the question of design professionals, in short. Taste, therefore, has
two distinct meanings; it may mean personal predilection but, when cultivated,
it may serve as judgment of quality.

People who expressed distaste for art
glass are entitled to their opinions, but
their judgement, by and large, are not as
well founded as that of the architect who
designed thebuilding. This is not elitism
but a simple truth. It is not merely a
matter of courtesy but ofclear reasoning
that all opinions are not equal. I may
consult a friend who is a lawyer about the
pain in my lower abdomen, but I would
rather go to my physician for a more
reliable opinion, and consult the lawyer
about legal or, as I prefer to put it,
lawyerly, matters.
This is not elitism but common sense.
I, for one, am inclined to trust architects
more than economists on the matter of
good design, and on the matter of this
particular art glass I trust the architect
who designed this building more than
any other architect, whoever that may be:
Pelli, Isozaki, Tigerman, Venturi, Gehry,
Pei, or Philip Johnson. Our architect's
name, incidentally but importantly, is

and grow. So, we also speak of acquired
taste. The process is acculturation, and
those of us who are immigrants like myself are very familiar with it, as are travelers to unfamiliar lands and exotic restaurants. Things, sights, behaviors, and
customs that I had found distasteful
crude, coarse, vulgar, odd, gross, even
in my early years in this
disgusting
culture are innumerable; most of them
eventually became not only acceptable
but even likable. Picasso was ridiculed as

an epitome of incomprehensible modem
art most of his lifetime; there are not
many today, in my estimation, who will
willingly tear up a Picasso scribble as
trash though the motivation may be economical rather than aesthetic. In 1889 for
the Universal Exposition in Paris, Gustave
Eiffel built a tower, and Parisians hatedit
and demanded that it be dismantled
even before it was complete; intellectuals and common people alike thought it

was the ugliest thing that any human
mind could ever conceive, and no adjective of condemnation was spared to denigrate it. For that matter. Impressionists
were vilified in their day precisely for the
colors the critics considered unnatural,
inelegant, and improper. When Abbot
Suger introduced stained glass windows
at St. Denis, they were in fact so novel
and shocking that they raised the eyebrows of the Cistercians who favored no
color; and today Gothic means stained
glass windows in the popular mind, and
Cistercian churches are barely remembered. Eventually, the Eiffel Tower became the pride of Parisian?. ar>H today it
is virtually synonymous with the city so
that no one can think of Paris without its
Eiffel Tower. Similarly, Pompidou Center was despised when it was built, and I.
M. Pei' s glass pyramid at theLouvre was
also ridiculed even by those who should
know better. It was not too long ago,
either, when the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, brilliantly conceived by Maya
Ying Lin, almost did not get built because the public opinon found it sterile,

undignified, and insulting

to the veter-

ans. Some stillhate these buildings, I am
sure; but converts are countless. Taste
changes.
This brings up the matter of integrity,

and I mean integrity in two different
senses: the integrity of the building and
the integrity of judgment. Some hate art
glass; others cannot stand the colors. In
either case, there is a tendency to isolate
the windows from their context, the integrity of the total design of the building.
I am, in fact, impressed by the quickness
of the community to respond to the glass
as much as by its lack of knowledge to
form an informed opinion; it responded,
in my view, hastily and impatiently.
Few have seen the glass from the
interior of the building. Many expressed
their dislikeof the glass before the frames
were put in; and, since in the incomplete
state the glass panes abut the stones directly, the glass looks flimsy and reminded many of cheap plastic. Few have
seen how the windows would look when
properly lit from the inside. Any poet or
artist would say that an informed criticism of an unfinished work is welcome
but not a final judgment.
It is unfair to call a painting bad and
advise the painter to discard it when it is
not yet finished, even when that painting
is a portrait and the sitter reserves the
right to take it or leave it. A poet may
appreciate a suggestion to excise a word
in her/his poem (or even line after line as
Pound did to Eliot's effort), provided a
judicious reasoning is given, as by a peer
who understands how the whole poem
works. Critics of the glass did not give
much thought why it might be justified,
and preceded to indict its adoption without waiting to hear the architect's defense.

more, where tolerance

has always been hailed
as virtue, and more so
today than ever in matters of culture, creed,
sexual orientation, and
color (indeed), there is no reason why the

community cannot give it a benefit of
doubt and allow itself a chance to get
acculturated to the new and unfamiliar,
the brave new design, however queer it
may seem.
Color, nevertheless, is subjective; if
we don't like a particular color, as some

insist, we just don't.There is a measure
of truth in this statement; trying to like
what we don't like always requires a
heroic effort.
Then, too, it requires timefor the shock
of the new to wear off. But the resistance
the palette of the Kohlberg art glass met
can be historically explained. Modernism in architecture rejected color; for a
large stretchofthis century Le Corbusier' s
white cubes and Mies van der Rohe's
transparent glass reigned supreme as the
color of the elite, while the populace
went for Art Deco, and this is still the
case for the Postmodern public. The pref-

of the academics for no color is,
therefore, as predictable as it is understandable. White is, in fact, almost invariably the color a faculty member requests when time comes to repaint a
faculty house, as the Physical Plants'
painting crew so well know and keep in
stock different shades of white; to my
knowledge no one ever asked for pink,
emerald, lavender, or ocean blue; such
colors are cheap, they feel, and white is
sophisticated as is no color on natural
wood. When Michael Graves reintroduced colors on the exterior walls of
buildings in Portland in 1983, they were
ochre, olive preen, teal, and chocolate,
and they shocked the world. But by 1990,
the PoMo palette has become as prevalent in our city scapes as white was before
Graves, even though many undoubtedly
still find them displeasing. Helfand's
colors may make some think of the nifty
50's; but the decorator's choice then was
salmon pink, baby blue, lime green, and
sherbet orange. I know, I was there.
Helfand's colors are new and we cannot
quite place it, and there's the rub. She is
most likely ahead of us, if that matters.
Imagine Kohlberg Hall with plain glass
in allits windows; it may be more sophisticated to some but it will look like an
economy version of Parrish Hall, plainer
and simpler, no frills. Give the building
some of the more attractive features of
arches over the windows, for
Parrish
example; some in the planning process,
in fact, found square windows displeasing, and argued for round heads.
We would then have gotten a Parrish
pastiche, an 1860'sdesign built in 1990'5,
Addison Hutton revisited. Helfand's
building asserts itself, quietly and subtly
true to the Swarthmore tradition, as an
addition to the campus architecture from
the end of the 20th century. "A college
draws strength from tradition, and energy from the necessity of change," so we
read in the College Bulletin. Kohlberg
Hall, as designed by Helfand, says exactly that—concisely and cogently. Itis a
monument to Swarthmore 2001.

Integrity of Brus Article Questioned
By Jason Gray Zengerle
It's not often that we're presented with
opportunity to eng age in an honest and
candid dialogue about race with people
of different races. Issues of race, itseems,
are most often discussed among meman

bers of the

same race.

In fact, I can't

recall a spontaneous, integrated discussion of race in all of my time at Swarthmore. When my white friends and I

gathered for dinnerand shook our heads
the Simpson verdict or tried to sort

at

through our feelings about the Million
Man March, we might as well have been
sitting around an alabaster table. Mindful of this fact, it was about a month ago
that Iparticipated in a campus discussion
entitled "Race in America: We Aren't
Even on the Same Planet!" Moderated
by two professors and attended by amultiracial slew of Swarthmore students, the
forum was indeed that great rarity: a
racial dialogue between races. While
America's andSwarthmore's racial problems were not solved in that hour-and-ahalf discussion, people of different races
were exposed to each other's various
views, feelings, and beliefs, and I left the
forum feeling that something, albeit small,
had been accomplished. At least people
of different races were talking to, and not
about, each other.
Unfortunately, my sentiments about
the discussion were not universally
shared. In a scathing critique of the Race
in America forum ["Racial Realpdlitik
OnPlanetSwat,"Nov. 10,1995],Michael
Brus accuses the dialogue's participants
of being oblivious to the "hapless
and
defense[s]
of
racism"
"rationalization[s] of ethnic hatred" presented by some studentsat the discussion
and he laments the "frenzied finger-pointing" and "obsession with white racism"
that he felt characterized the affair. While
I do not share Mr. Brus's sentiments
about the forum, I must confess that his
views appear reasonable and I don'tfeel
the need to engage in a debate over what
seems to be a genuine difference of opinion between us regarding the valueof the
Race in America discussion. I cannot,
however, stomach the manner in which
he presented these views.
Too much of today's political thought
and writing is the product of those who
refuse to engage in intellectually honest
endeavors. Many current political thinkers and writers are more concerned with
bombast and bluster than reason and persuasion. Rather than construct arguments
designed to address the concerns of those
who hold opposing views, these individuals are content to present their opin-

ions in such a fashion as to appeal only to
like-minded people and solidify their
various ideological credentials. These
individuals make no effort to engender
understanding among those with whom
they disagree. This approach contributes

Of course Mr. Brus, assuming he was

England's Educational System: Perspective of a Swattie in France
By Christopher Rodger

There is no question that for the most
part Swarthmore students are motivated.
This is not, however, universal. If you
take time on a trip to England to talk to
the residents you will quickly be struck
by the general feeling that there is a lack
of motivation on the part of the students

in England's establishments of higher
education. To place blame on the students themselves belies the heart of the
problem, however. This lack of motivation stems from a society where education often will not get you to where you
want to go. In a country where economic
stagnation is evident, employment opportunities are limited and education provides no guarantees. On a recent trip to
England I was able to talk to informed
people about the problem and this allowed me to draw some conclusions about
the situation.
"Savino thinks that students here are

not very motivated,"saidmyAuntHilary.
From a later conversation it appeared

that Savino, an Italian currently living in
England and taking art classes, really
believes this. He was under the impres-

sion that the other students in his class
did not really seem interested in what
they were doing. They are late to class
frequently and never pay attention to
what is going on. But one example is not
enough to prove the existence of the
problem. It was backed up, however, by
two other sources. One of my cousins
majored in Psychology in college. "How
useless was that?"sherhetorically asked.
She is now involved with social work,
having taken jobs working in pubs, the
only place she could find employment
before that. Her friends were in similar
situations. Despite all the different majors that they had pursued they still had
problems finding work in related fields.
My cousin has a lofty goal of doing some
community work in India next year, but

is extensive. Another cousin, James, who
is 23, is currently studying medicine. He
hopes thatit will lead to something since
he took the time to examine the job mar
ket before choosing a career path. Threi
cases, all in differentregions of the coun
try. Obviously there exists a problem in
higher education.
The major cause of this problem is
evident. Itis the stagnant job market that
characterizes England'scurrent economic
situation. Before going back to school
Savino was working in a clothing store in
England despite being in his thirties.
Before that he was an insurance agent ir.
Italy. That is a dramatic shift of employment level. My cousin Finola now has
job as an assistant editor at a magazine
based out of London, having previously
worked also in a clothing store. The first
thing that she was asked to do at her new
job was to send outrejection letters to the

other applicants. This was no small task;
there were more than 500 applicants for
the same position. Finally I point again to
the employment of many younger people
in pubs. To quote Billy Joel, "I am sure
that I could be a movie star ifI could just
get out of this place."
This stagnant job market has a couple
of effects. First, the government is encouraging people to continue their education at the higher levels. The reason for
this is clear.The government uses education as a means to keep the unemployment figures down. In principle education is free to those who seek it in England. The government encourages students to continue with their education to
keep them out of the stagnant job market.
Lower unemployment levels help ensure
that the government does not change in
composition, and helps assure reelection. This, however, becomes something
ofa viciouscircle. Students become overqualified for jobs that they could perhaps

otherwise have taken. Another problem rewarding job.

The question is what can change in the

The Phc.nix

I WANT MY TWO DOLLARS!
Rolling Stones' New CD Shows
Know-how, But Music Shows Age
By Dan Sachar
Some things, just like the Energizcr
Bunny, just keep on going and going.
The Rolling Stones is a good example.
With an average age surpassing that of
the United States of America, this thirtyodd-year-old band from the United
Kingdom has released yet another CD,
this time with surprisingly little fanfare
from its label, Virgin Records. Stripped
features the Stones in a live performance
which features, as the title suggests, some
acoustic numbers. Nevertheless, do not
be fooled, the band is plugged in for most
of therecord as it plays an unremarkable,
but pleasing fourteen songs.
I have to give a hand to the Stones.
Coming on the heels of their Voodoo
Lounge tour, the band could easily have
released a concert album featuring all of
the traditionalhits. Yet, Mick Jaggerand
the crew decided not to follow in the
footsteps of Pink Floyd, whose
misbegotten Pulse recreated a previous
live album in its entirety. Instead, the
Stones dove deep into theirold canon and
brought out some rarities such as "The
Spider and the Fly," "Dead Flowers,"
and "Sweet Virginia." Purists, therefore
will undoubtedly be pleased with
Stripped.
On the other hand, there are songs
which, for lack of a better term, are "sellouts." Acoverof Dylan's "Like a Rolling
Stone" is either a tribute to the song
which bore the band's name, or a cheap
way of stirring the audience. Despite my
jibe, this track actually is one of the most
energetic and entertaining on the album.
Old traditionals such as "Wild Horses"
and "Angie" are trotted out to keep the
listener paying attention. The band's
playing is good, and Keith and Ronnie's
guitar solos sound fine. Even Charlie
Watts, the most ancient drummer in the
rock world, maintains his sense of rythm

As a whole, Stripped is not a bad live
album but aerionstv 'irt« (•nercv The
band goes from one song to the other
without much of the sense that they are
doing something unique andremarkable.
In many ways, Stripped is a fitting
reminder that the Stones are getting to (or
have past) the age where it may be wise
to hang-up the guitars. This is most
evident with Mick Jagger's singing.
While he used to wail with the energy of
youth, his voice now sounds blase and
uninteresting. There are moments when
he strains to hit notes which he used to
reach effortlessly. It makes one yearn for
earlier days.
Despite all that I have said. Stripped
remains an interesting album. How is
this? Since the musical CD doubles as an
inter-active CD-ROM. I discovered this
as I meant to listen to the album through
the computer and popped it into my CDdrive. The next thing I know, the faces of
Mick, Ronnie, Keith, and Charlie appear
on my screen. Clicking on each of these
faces will bring up the respective bandmembers talking about how they went

clips of the "Like a Rolling Stone" Video
in which we see ecstatic fans leaping
about to the music. Here finally is an
indication that the Stones can elicit an
excited reaction from many people.
Perhaps I have been too harsh on the
Stones. I have always felt that the best
thing about a live albumis listening to the
roar of thecrowd as the audience reacts to
their favorite songs. A live performance
is all about a band connecting with their
audience. Yetihe mix of Stripped a.\\but
excludes the audience so one hears very
little applause or cheering. This is too
bad. For the energy which the audience
might have provided is lacking in the
band. The Rolling Stones sound fine,
play a good set, and come up with a halfway decent live album. Do not forget,
however, that there was oncea timewhere

Rambunctious: an adjective

Blue in the Face (***) It's one of
life's ironies that something done
haphazardly and at the spur of the
moment, often surpasses in achievement
something that has been long planned
and carefully thought out. Theexitement
and raw energy of an improvised effort
can create a dynamic that just clicks.
This is what happened with Blue in the
Face, a film that went from concept to
celluloidless than a week after its parent
film Smoke was wrapped. The resulting
film, which emerged from this rather
unorthodox genesis, is more humorous,
honest, and varied than the film which
bore it.
Three days after finishing shooting for
Smoke, director Wayne Wang and his
collaborator, novelist Paul Auster,
returned to their Brooklyn sets with
dozens of actors (working for scale pay)
at their disposal. Their goal was to shoot
a movie in less than a week. With only
broad sketches of story situations to guide
them, the actors relied on considerable
improvisation to create a community of
eclectic and loosely related characters.
The task then remained for Wang and
Auster to piece together these shots in a
way that would reflect and resemble the
borough itself.
Both films center around a Brooklyn
cigar shop and its manager Auggie Wren
(Harvey Keitel). This, however, is one of
the few qualities they both share. While
Smoke has a large ensemble cast and
many interactions between them, it never
lost sight of its main story or therelated
subplots. Blue in the Face, on the other
hand, has no formal plot, rather it is a web
of interconnected vignettes. Chance
encounters around the cigar shop, are
mixed with documentary style face-thecamera testimonials from a wide
assortment of non-actors. WilliamHurt's
monotonous philosophical monologues
in Smoke, are replaced with Lou Reed's
deadpan observations of all things
distinctively Brooklyn and Jim
Jarmusch's anecdotal nostalgia about his
love affair with cigarettes in Blue in the
Face.
The performances are critical to this

film, because the actors were afforded
such considerable discretion that they
hold a large responsibilty for creating the
story. Fortunately all of the actors
involved from Roseanne to RuPaul, give
solid conik. turns. The cast of gloniicd
cameos features: Lily Tomlin as a
homeless man, Victor Argo as the cigar
store owner, GiancarloEsposito as a store
patron, and some other big stars (Madonna, Michael J. Fox). Two acting
revelations are made in the film. First,
Rosanne's disenchanted housewife is a
bittersweet portrayal and proves her to be
an actress with untapped dramatic talent.
Second, and more exciting, is arrival of
M alik Yoba (Fox TV 's N. Y. Undercover)
to the big screen Playing a srr.a" time
hustler, Yoba exudes charisma and
commands his screen time, even with
Keitel. The film will not make him a star,
but it makes clear his star potential.
In summation. Blue in the Face is a
lighthearted comedy and a sort of thank
you note written largely by the people
who made it, to the people of Brooklyn.
Most importantly, the film reminds us
that thepeople of Brooklyn (and through
extension all of us) share collective human sensibilites which transcend race,
gender and other categorization of humanity. An ode to personal human interaction and neighborhood which exists in
the largest and most impersonal of cities—New York.
P.S. The closing credits are
interspersed withrandom one-liners and
revisitations of all of the film's players,
so be sure to stay until thevery end. [Blue

owner, Andy, leaves the room, the toys
spring into life, gathering at the feet of
their beloved leader, Woody (Tom
Hanks), aposable action figure equipped
with sheriff's badge and six-shooter.
Woody will maintain his authority as
long as he remains Andy's favorite toy.
But there's anew kid in town: the one and
only Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), space
ranger and lantern-jawed dim-bulb
extraordinaire.Buzz genuinely believes
that he is a space ranger. He'sjust biding
his time in Andy's bedroom until he can

perfectly willing to vie with Woody for

Little Bo Peep puts it, a clear case of laser

Toy Story works like a charm on a great
many levels. It is, of course, a delightful
children's movie, with allof thebells and

whistles that spell blockbuster success
(not to mention a tsunami of tie-ins). It's
also a sophisticated and deliciously witty

comedy, crammed with clever one-liners, in-jokes, movie references (watch
for a shot stolen directly from Jurassic

Woody, so all-American sounding that
he might as well just go ahead and turn
into an apple pie, echoes his Jim Lovell

especially when confronted with the
gung-ho inanity of Allen's Buzz
Lightyear. The rest of the cast is, without
exception, perfect, right down to the
metal-mouthed lisp of the villainous Sid

superb, both technically amazing and
exuberantly witty. It would be nice to
enjoy a family-oriented movie without
the soporific croaking of Randy Newman,
who "contributes" a handful of more-orless useless, although mercifully short,
tunes to the soundtrack. But, that minor
quibble aside. Toy Story is damn near
perfect. It's a smart, engaging, and consistently hilarious bauble, every bit as
comfortable and delightful as good old
Mr. Potatohead.

Professor Contributes to Astronomy Research
By Stephanie Wang
Taking students up to theObservatory
to observe the stars on clear nights has

been a tradition that Professor Wulff D.
Heintz has been maintaining for many
years. After 26 years of teaching at Swarthmore, Professor Heintzhas no plans to
retire.
Bom 1930 in Wurzburg, West Germany, Professor Heintz lived a difficult
childhood under Nazi rule. His family
was not, in his own words, "politically
privileged" because of his father's involvement with the Social Democrats. It
was difficultfor his father to maintain a
stable job, and the family was forced to
move around many times before the end
of WWII. Professor Heintz was then 14
years old.
After the war ended. Professor Heintz
was able to complete his studies at
Wurzburg University and Munich University from 1948 to 1953. Hemajored in
Mathematics and Chemistry. In 1953 he
obtained his Ph.D in Astronomy at
Munich University, and in 1967he earned
the Privatdozent
an advanced postdoctorate degree—atTechnological University also situated in Munich. Professor Heintz then remained at the
University's Institute for History of Science to act as part-time lecturer.
During this time hehad beeninvolved
in various research projects that tookhim
to countries such as Italy, Britain, and
Australia. In 1967 he was offered a research position at Swarthmore College.
Two years later he officially joined the
Department of Astronomy as an Associate Professor. Since then. Professor
Heintz has held the Department Chair
from 1972 to 1982.
For 32 years, Professor Heintz has
concentrated on a research project entailing double and multiple stars, orbit theory,

and relative astrometry. Put simply, the
project includesphotographing stars and,
among other things, determining the distances between them.To date, there have
been over 50,000 double stars measured,
900 new pairs discovered, some 400 studies of orbits, and with staff, about 900
stellar parallaxes studied. This massive
82-year research undertaking ended last
year. Heintz was involvedwith theproject
from the beginning ofhis years at Swarthmore, and it was the main reason Professor Heintz accepted the invitation to
come to the college. He expressed regret
over the decline in research endeavors in
recent years. "I wish there could be more
emphasis placed on research," said the
professor. "It would be helpful for the
students to meet those who have actual
research experiences." In his view, the
weakened considerations on research "is
not good for the scholarly reputation of
the college."
In addition to research, Professor
Heintz has published over 160 papers,
and has been author, co-author, or editor
of 9 books, the mostrecent book being A
Compendium of Practical Astronomy
(1994), which he co-edited and revised
with Harry J. Augensen.
Courses which Professor Heintz
teaches include Introductory Astronomy,

Positional Astronomy, Cosmology, and
Meteorology. Over the 26 years he has
been teaching here, he has seen the curriculum change from mostly classical
astronomy to modem astrophysics. "The
field of astronomy has become more diversified," he said. In earlier days, for
instance, students were taught the motions of stars and planets, and properties
that were observed with the naked eye.
The origins ofstars and how theyevolved
were not taught simply because they were
unknown. In the last 50 years, however,
great advances have been made in these
areas. The study of astronomy is constantly evolving. To demonstrate how
fast things change, "even some theories
that are in current textbooks are in danger
of losing credibility," said Professor
Heintz.
When asked how the students ofSwarthmorehave changed during the 26 years
he has been at the college. Professor
Heintz said that there should be reasonably challenging courses available tostudents. He believes thatPrimary Distribution Courses should include more than
bland, uninstructive material. These
courses should also "demand something
from the students."
Heintz added, "That is why a number
of upper-level classes should be main-

tained even if student attendance is not
very high."
Professor Heintz would also like to
encourage students to take advantage of
a liberal arts education. "The undergraduate years are the last opportunity for
students to obtain a broad, well-rounded
education," he said. "In college, I poked
my nose in a variety of subjects," he said.
"Once you are in graduate school, you
are virtually in aprison." On this note, he
suggested thatperhaps Swarthmore's current system of requiring a specific number of courses in the Humanities, the
Social Sciences, and the Natural Sciences may be slightly restrictive to the
students. He believes that students may
benefitfrom more freedomofchoice. At
any rate, he expressed hope that current
requirements will not be narrowed down
further. Heintz hopes that Swarthmore
will work to maintain a tradition of diversity.
Professor Heintz is currently involved
in research that deals with visual observations of the stars and measurements
with thenakedeye. Heinzis scheduled to
give an upcoming faculty lunch lecture
titled "The Timing of Matthew 2," dealing with the favorite topic of the 'Star of
Bethlehem.' Heintz is also busy preparing the final exams.

Footloose Frenzy Creates Warm Fuzzies
for Swarthmore Moviegoers in DuPont
By Paula loanide
It appeared to be a pretty normal Friday evening...
"Hey, do you wanna go to the party?"
"Uhh, I heard it was canceled."
"Oh. Well, how about goin' to the
movie?"
"Uhh, what's playing?"
"I dunno.I guess it's, uh, "Footloose."
"Oh. Isn't that some crazy movie with
Kevin Bacon from the '80s?"
"Yeah, uh, I think so."
"Allright Might as well, I mean can't
be worse than sittin' here doin'nothin'."
And so we left to join the packed
DuPont cinema. People talking, animated.
My friend was visiting me from Portland,
Oregon. I felt stupid taking him to a
movie, I mean is that all we do at Swarthmore on Friday nights? Somehow I
wanted to show him a representation of
Swarthmore, but nothing seemed to fit..
It had been a very intense week. Gabe
had committed suicide that Wednesday,
the work load seemed to intensify by the
minute, people were restless everywhere,
confusion, contemplation of big questions... Didn't want to think anymore...
Just sit back and enjoy a movie, whatever
it may be...
But this wasn't just any movie.
People seemed a little more excited
than usual, but otherwise nothing unusual was taking place— image was not
focused for ten minutes, the projector
was making funny noises, lights were
going off and on, everybody calling out
complaints... But then the song started...
"Footloose, footloose, kick off your Sunday shoes!..." The audience feet started
moving, screaming at the stylin' pairs of
shoes upon the screen, singing along in a
chorus to the familiar song. And then,
KEVIN BACON came on, and what more
can be said about the star of the night..
He drove his rockin' Volkswagen Bug in
the wind, tapped the steering wheel to the
muzak, spiked the hair, put on the loose
tie, and made some trouble in the conservative litde town desperately in need for

r011...
Then the tractor scene came 0n...
Who would it be? Kevin Bacon or
the boyfriend? May the best tractor
win... The intensity, oh, we couldn't
stand it... But then the glory.. .Kevin
Bacon wins... The audience goes
wild with screaming. (By this time
all seemed to be a little insane.)
But then, Kevin Bacon couldn't
stand it anymore... The suppression
of thelaw laid heavy upon him— he
HAD TO DANCE. Wildly he goes
to the infamous, deserted warehouse... He's mad, he's drinking his
beer, and then, no, he can't stand it
any longer... The muzak starts and
he leaps into dance, does all sorts of
tricks... The audience is going
crazy... And then theclimax: a triple
take of Kevin Bacon flying like a
bird into an impressive arch! (Later
to be imitated occasionally in spontaneous moments by various Swarthmore students).
By this time the audience was
under some sort ofobsessive spell...
They weren't just watching "Footloose"
anymore, they were all characters of
"Footloose," hired to act, scream, dance,
and sing all at the same time.
The final prom scene starts... "Footloose, footloose, take off your Sunday
shoes..." All the characters in the movie
are dancing. And then, perhaps it should
have been expected... A few moving silhouettes appear on the screen, then a few
more, then the wholeaudience is on their
feet, dancing like they've never danced
before. Soon people are on the front table,
screaming along with the song, and shaking their bodies to the rhythm. Friends
are turning to friends and hugging them,
strangers are giving high fives to strangers, all dancing as a unison. The song
finally stops, everybody thinks the party
is over, but NO! Some wacky projector
guys rewind the tape and the song starts
over... Everybody continues dancing... A
broadcast is sent throughout Swarthmore—"Footloose" party at McphlsUn»!

Senior Company to
Perform "The Blue Door"
By Anne Frankenfield

The dancing continues tlirough the night
in dreams and even some dancing sleepwalkers are reported...
All had been transformed into some
crazy maniacs that night... Perhaps they
could have been called... Swarthmore
students.
Glowing with happiness, I turned to
my friendCasey fromPortland and said,
"I guess this is Swarthmore."
The wacky thing is that there was something more to "Footloose." The
audience's reaction had been so united,
as if all were trying to shakeoff the same
stress, frustrations, and emotions...as if
all were seeking some sort of relief and
joy.
As it turned out, in acting as one body,
the strength was found to see this joy in
something as simple as a movie. It takes
a unique community to be able to instinctively come together that way... It's nice
to realize that we're part of it once in a
while.

confusion with his daughters, the master

SeniorCompany, known in the course
catalogue as Theater 99, is a class that
originated three years ago. The semester-long, one credit class meets twelve
hours a week to focus on their goal of
working together to create and perform
theater productions for either public or
private enjoyment
Senior Company has one faculty advisor, Professor Allen Kuharski, however the members essentially work on
their own as the members of a company
in theprofessional world of theaterwould
handle a project The result is a culmination of the talents of senior theater majors. This year's membersinclude: Alexis
Gander, Jove Graham, Wilson Hall, Joel
Johnson, Morgan Phillips, Lesley Tsina,
ElizabethWebster, and VanessaMorreo.
The course catalogue describes the
course as follows: "A workshop course
emphasizing issues of collaborative
playmaking across lines of specialization, ensemble development of performance projects, and the collective dynamics of forming the prototype of a
theater company. Working with an audience in performance of a single project,
or series of projects."
This year, the Senior Company will
perform "The Blue Door," an original
piece based on stories by Gabriel Garcia
Marque/., O. Henry, Edgar Allen Poe,
James Thurber, and Donald Barthelme,
on December 9,10,11 and 12 at 8:00 pm
in theFrear Ensemble Theater (Room 1)
in theLang Performing Arts Center. Each
member chose a different role in the
production at the beginning of the semester. Based on the training they have received at S warthmore thus far, as well as
their career plans in the future, they selected from the positions of director, designer, dramaturge, or actor. After selecting their roles, the group set out to
write the script.
Writing the script was a long and tedious process. Basically, everyone

brought in ideas from texts of various
short stories, essays, poems, etc., that
they liked and wanted to use in the script.
After several weeks of brainstorming
on how to incorporate the works into a
performancepiece, theybegan improvising. Every day new ideas were developed
so the final product is far from the original plans. For example, the group had
started with an interest in "extraordinary
people in ordinary circumstances," which
led them to the writings and life of Edgar
Allen Poe. Using this as a starting point,
they read, discussed, and improvised until
they had something workable for the
stage.

All the scenes in the performance are
based on improvisations of various stories with some dialogue directly from the
text. Eventually, these were finalized and
a working dialogue was developed to be
used as the script The play itself was
"written" by the company but was designed to be a performance, not to be
read.
Although the script encompassed much
ofthe company's time, sets and costumes
also had to be designed. The costumes
are actually also a product of improvisation, conceived during the script-designing by members of the company. For at
least one of the scenes, a rear-projection
screen is used aiding in the only silent
scene in the play.
"The Blue Door" is a story that explores the ideas of people living passionate lives and the simplest of occurrences
throw their lives into turmoil. The one
character who remains controlled and
cautious is the one who suffers no pain,
and eventually woos all the others to his
type oflife. On a general level, the play is
at times very serious and includes a lot of
dark comedy. As a whole, thepiece proves
to be a very entertaining and impressive
work of theater.

Women's Basketball Scoring Struggles

Once again, Ernie "I. M. Sport"
Prudente heads up a season of
Swarthmore intramural athletics. This
winter, Swatties will compete in basketball, volleyball, and indoor soccer.
Prudente's experience and good humor
make intramural sports popular at Swat.
The basketball league is by far the
largest: eighteen teams, from the Disco
Interns to the Skinny Awkward Tools to
the House of Brain. Each year, the overwhelming interest in intramural basketball leads to a season-ending tournament
that rivals the NCAA Final Four in excitement, if not crowd enthusiasm.
The teams are comprised of varying
groups of people from hall members to
intensely competitive Swatties who just
don't have time to play Varsity basketball. For most students, it is a fun way to
spend a Sunday afternoon.

Mascot Voting Extended By A Week
Low turnout from Students, Faculty, Staff prompts extension
By Jen Philpott

Last week, Swarthmore students, faculty, and staff had their first opportunity
to vote for a mascot

Only 250 people

voted, and; as a result, voting has been
extended for another week.

In order to vote for the mascot, or
against having one, stop in to the Alumni
Relations Office, Parrish 135, between
8:30 am and 4:30 pm. The voting will be
conducted by paper ballots.

Once again, the mascot choices are:
1) Garnet Foxes
2) Garnet Griffins
3) Little Quakers
4) Mighty Oaks
5) Swarming Earthworms
6) Wild Kangaroos
The Alumni Office is still collecting
alumni and parent's votes until Winter
Break. Thefinal results willbeannounced
after students return for next semester.

Volleyball, in its second season this
year, has a five team league thus far.
Volleyball teams follow the same rules
three men and three
as last season
women. The only team continuing from
last season is the ever-aptly named Bob
the Legend. Prudente hopes that this
league will flourish in seasons to come.
In indoor soccer there are six teams so
far, with only the Fabulous Faculty and
Stupendous Staff having the intrepidity
(or is it temerity?) to continue after the
fall outdoor soccer season. Perhaps the
students have simply been scared away
by the awesome ability of staffmembers
already enrolled.
Indoor soccer's only restriction is that
there can be no more than two varsity
players on a team. Game days for both
volleyball and indoor soccer are Thursday and Sunday; basketball is on Sunday
and Tuesday. If you're interested in
forming a team, talk to Ernie Prudente!.

Excellence
By Jen Philpott

Swarthmore's swimming program has
excelled in the past ten years.
Swarthmore sent several swimmers to
national competition in addition to garnering more interest than almost any
other Swarthmore sport.
Head coach, Susan Davis, is largely
responsible for the swimmingprogram's
phenomenal success. One swimmer commented, "Sue pushes us hard, but the
work always pays off in the end." Davis
joined the Swarthmore coaching staff in
1974 as the head women's team coach.
Davis has been head of both teams
since 1983. She is well known for her
pride and determination, but also for her
extensive experience in swimming and
athletics in general.
Coach Davis founded the swimming
program at SpringfieldCollege where she
swam as an undergraduate student Davis
thenearned her Masters degree at Smith
College where she founded their competitive swimming program.

In addition to the timeand effort Davis
devotes to coaching Swarthmore swimming, she also co-directs the two largest
privately run clinics in the U.S. for
coaches and swimmers.
Davis's personal experience with athletic competition extends beyond the pool
into the equine sphere. She competes in
3-day eventing with great success. In
fact, Davis has twice trained with the
U.S. Olympic Team, in 1973 and 1977.
Her horsefarm is a popular spot for swim
team barbequcs.
Davis is not only

a superb coach and
athlete, she is also an avid student of the
sport While on sabbatical leave in the

spring of 1993,Davis visited and studied
the swimming programs at Stanford,
Texas-Austin, and CalState-Bakersfield.
The combination of knowledge, experience, and motivation packaged in the
person of Sue Davis has proved to be a
winning combination for Swarthmore's
swimming program.

The table is set for Swarthmore
College's wrestling team. The wrestling
room overflows with high-caliber athletes and a high levelof intensity. Asihe
team edges closer to its first regular meet
of the season, only one question remains
unanswered. What will the new season
bring?
If the Takedown Tournament is any
indication, the beginning of the season
may bring a mixed bag of results. Almost
400 matches took place in Lamb-Miller
onNovember 18th. Each wrestler took to
the mat at least seven times.
For some Swarthmore wrestlers, the
tournament made itobvious thatthe skill
and technique were therebut a little something was missing: conditioning, experience at the collegiate level, or maybe just
good old-fashioned luck. One thing remained clear to all in attendance, however, Swarthmore will not give anything
up to anyone.

The wrestling room
overflows with highcaliber athletes and a
high level of intensity.
Two Swarthmore wrestlers placed in
this tournament. Adrian Wilson '99 led
the way, taking second place at 134 lbs.
in his first collegiate tournament. Cocaptain PeteBalvanz '9B placed fourth at
142 lbs., after a hard-fought semifinal
loss.
Other wrestlers turned in less success
ful performances, but their perseverance
reflected well on Swat. Samy Mir '96

and Rufus Frazier '9B, both first year
members of the team, faced tough
matches, but neither went down easily.
Football players have begun to show
up for practices, infusing the team with
new vigor. Tony Skiadas '99 and Curtis
Trimble '96 began practice this week.
After hobbling through his first practice,
Curtis Trimble commented, "The team
has found some sort of new 'mojo'. I
think they keep it in Bryce's locker next
to the 1970's polyester stretch pants and
the Latin book he was sporting throughout the tournament Saturday, but it's yet
to be spotted."
Swarthmore's wrestlers will test their
energy and resilience this Saturday
against Rutgers-Camden and Albright
Universities. This long-awaited start of
the regular wrestling season begins at
noon in Tarble Pavilion.

Amherst Wins Equinox
By Dave Lischer

Winter Intramurals
By Will Quale

The Phoenix sports staff
congratulates former
Swarthmore field hockey
coach, Richard Kentwell,
on his selection as U.S.
Division 111 Coach of the
Year, and a great season.

Amherst swept its games with
Haverford and Swarthmore in the 1995
Equinox Classic tournament. Retaining
its top 12 players from last year's 18-9
team, the Lord Jeffs were very experienced and talented. They rolled over
Haverford77-58, and edged SwarthmoTe
74-69
In addition to its loss to Amherst, the
Swarthmore Garnet fell to a mediocre
Macalester team 88-82. "We were certainly disappointed in the outcome [of
the tournament]. There were some bright
spots: the play of Sam Voolich ['96] in
the Macalester game and the freshman
Tim Schofield ['99] against Amherst,"
said Garnet co-captain Matt Grossman
'96.
Swarthmore had one player named to
the All-Tournament team, center Sam
Voolich '96.
Voolich poured in 24 points and seven
rebounds against the Scots ofMacalester.
In the tournament he averaged 19 points
and five rebounds per game and shot a
dazzling 72% from the field.
After the Lord Jeffs had jumped to an
early 24-4 lead only six minutes into the
game, Schofield helped key a comeback.
The Garnet had begun to nibble away at
the lead and were within 12 at 28-16
when Schofield went to work. His threepointer was the first of three Swarthmore
baskets on successive Amherst turnovers.
After sinking another three to pull his
team to within six, he drove the lane and
drew a foul. His two free throws pulled
the Garnet to within four with just over
five minutes left in the first half. The
Lord Jeffsretained that four point lead,
38-34, into half-time.
Both losses justified Coach Lee
Wimberly's concerns about his team. In
a preseason interview he expressed concern about how the team would defend
tall post players who could be expected

toregularly

outsize their defenders.Sader

proved more than a handful in the

Macalester game. He hit on nine of 15
shots and crashed the boards for a gamehigh 13 rebounds. His perimeter success
created openings underneath for the
Scots' quick guards to penetrate and create opportunities.
"While I think we're a better team,
they [Macalester] shot better that night.
It was a decent opening night effort, but
we were sluggish for a large part of it,"
said Garnet co-captain Craig Rodner '96.
Both teams were sluggish at the start, but,
in the end, the Scots' superior free-throw
shooting decidedthe game. The Scots hit
on all 13 free throws in the second half
while the Garnet shot an uncharacteristically poor seven of 15 from the charity
stripe.
Meanwhile the other host, Haverford,
had been blown out in its game against
the Lord Jeffs. Unfazed, the Fords defeated the lackluster Scots 71 -65 in thensecond game. "It was like two different
teams," said Rodner ofMacalester's disparate performances.
Although the outcome was a loss in
each of its two games, Swarthmore
showed it has the heart and desire this
year to come back from large early deficits. "Lastyear a lotof games came down
to thelast few minutes, and we seemed to
win them all," said Grossman. The Garnet were 9-3 last season in gamesdecided
by fewer than ten points.
This year we lost two close ones where
we played catch-up, but we're not concerned because we know how to win
these games," he added. One thing that
must be decided before the Garnet will
prevail in these close games is who will
take the shots with the game on the line.
Grossman bets that fellow guard Colin
Convey '97 or forward Ben Schall '97
will assume this role because they have
the "ability to create clear shots."

The most impressive performance of
a five team relay meet against Williams,

Amherst, Hamilton, and Springfield.
These teams are perennial powers in diGerson '99, He tore through the water in
vision HI swimming and gave the Garnet
very solid competition.
This meet differed from the norm in
that it consisted of only relays; as a result,
the meet went unscored because of its
atypical format. The meet was a two-day
affair for the Garnet, as the team had to
seave the day before.
A number of members of the team
were suffering from illnesses or injuries.
Said Alex Huk '96, "We're presently a
rag-tag, beat-the-bag, walk-with-a-limp,
band-aid swim team, but we're still the
fastest men and women around." Several
swimmers, however, had stellar days.
On the women's side, the 3-by-100
breaststroke (Erin Fulkerson *99, Jenny
Harvey '99, and Skye Fulkerson '96)
swam a solid 3:35, winning their event.
Also, the all-frosh 200 free relay (Janine
Gent '99, Jenny Harvey '99, Jill Belding
'99, and Cathy Polinski '99) looked impressive, coming within a second of the
schoolrecord. For the women, it was the
"Day of Harvey." In addition to the
above swims, she got her best time ever
in the 200 free.
The men, while consistent (except for
those who were sick), had no real
standouts at Williams except for the 500
freestyles of Mark Friedberg '9B and
Carl Sanders '9B (both sub-5:10) and
"Big" Al Huk's 100 breaststroke.
