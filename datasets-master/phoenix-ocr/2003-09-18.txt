Round Two for ITS: Worm, OS X
plague public area computers
Network administrators say college is getting back to normal
BY DEIRDRE CONNER AND MATTHEW FITTING
dconner2 and mfittinl@swarthmore.edu
The computer virus that wreaked technological

havoc across campus last weekend proved, according to Information Technology Services, the worst
Swarthmore has ever seen. Generating fictional
addresses at random, it sent infected computers
searching those addresses to seek out other possible carriers. Meanwhile, in the time the computer
searched, the virus would scan it for weaknesses
and possibly attack.
According to the Microsoft TechNet Web site, a
successful virus could, after attacking, take any
action it wanted, "including changing Web pages,
reformatting the hard disk or adding new users to
the local administration group."
For the college, individual problems were far
less severe than the enormous amounts of traffic generated by those computers
chasing after other potential
hosts. This traffic overwhelmed core electronic networks designed to automatically dispense with it and

"work one-tenth of the time."

Still, according to Jacbosen, the viruses, not ITS,

are to blame. "If we didn't get hit with the Blaster
worm in August... that took a lot of our resources
to work through the Apple issues," she said. "It's

ing Friday, according to
Mark Dumic, manager of
Networking, Systems and Telecommunications in

ITS.
The problems were, in part, a continuation of
the virus difficulties that affected the campus
Labor Day weekend. "We were OK for three or four
days," Dumic said. "Then the second wave hit."
Unfortunately, ITS could do nothing to stop the difficulties —the viruses were not released until just
before the semester started.
Last Wednesday, Manager of Client Services
Robin Jacobsen was driving home and feeling good
that ITS and its dorm consultants had finally gotten
the Blaster worm under control. That was when

attacking.
"I wanted to cry," she said. "You conquer one
worm or one virus and you turn around and there's

another."
In addition, this fall's viruses have proven nastier and more opportunistic than those ITS has

fought in previous years.
"The newest types of viruses and worms don't
need you opening an e-mail," Jacobsen said, and
can infect a computer without the user ever knowing.
The beginning of the school year is always a
busy time, she added, because students' computers
have not been updated over the summer. Issues
with updating these computers has led to difficulties with public area Apples. New OS X operating
systems have prevented students from logging on
and printing, though Jacobsen said those problems
have mostly been solved.
Most problems, she added, are coming from big
printing jobs, and students should not try to print
large PDF files to dorm cluster printers. Mac issues
could have been ironed out before students
returned to campus if not for the network infection.
Students had little sympathy for ITS difficulties,

however.
"My seminar paper was stuck in purgatory,"
Marc Boucai 'O4 said. "Any chance of getting information or e-mails was impossible."

Sarah Cohodes 05 was both happy and upset
with computing issues so far this semester. "I'm
very pleased that they switched to OS X," she said.
"On the other hand, I have a lot of stuff to print.
And it won't print."
Joseph Spadola 'O4 had a host of complaints for
ITS. "It takes, like, four days to download," he said,
adding that he had been reduced to listening to
songs that serve as rings on mobile telephones.
"Every time I print, it either doesn't work or

because of the huge
amount of traffic activity coming from computers there. According to
Jacbosen, while the network usually receives five
to 10 packets of requested information from the
network from Wharton, Friday night it was receiving more than one million packets.
Dumic, however, reiterated that individual
users, by and large, were left unaffected as far as
damage from the virus was concerned. The traffic
generated was so heavy, though, "that other traffic
can't compete."
Preventive measures included trying to block
traffic closer to its source, as was the case with
Wharton, as well as communicating with users
whose units ITS identified as major carriers. It was

Internet problems were solely virus-related. He
added that complaints over network outages were
less frequent than for the Internet.
Microsoft's own Security and Privacy Web site,
which Dumic urged users to visit if they had not
already properly patched their computers, listed
the virus's severity level at "critical," its most serious rating. Operating systems susceptible to the
virus include Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000,
Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP, the most
commonly used Windows system on campus.
Windows Millennium Edition remained unaffected,
as did all Apple computers.
Troubles began Friday, two days after Microsoft
released its Security Bulletin MSO3-039, warning
that the virus could allow a remote user to take
over an infected Windows computer and offering
the necessary update to fix the infection. Jacobsen
warned the campus at 1:47 p.m. via e-mail that it
might encounter problems with Web browsing and

Forecasters say Hurricane Isabel will come ashore in North Carolina,
then move through central Virginia and into east central Pennsylvania.

College braces for Isabel
Storm to pass south, west of Delco
BY DEIRDRE CONNER
dconner2@swarthmore.edu
As Hurricane Isabel stalks the eastern seaboard today, college
administrators are planning how best to protect Swarthmore from

the high winds and rain sure to lash southeastern Pennsylvania late
tonight and into Friday morning.
Though it was unclear late Wednesday how close the eye of the
storm will come to the area, facilities personnel have been working
to clear gutters and storm drains, oil up and gas up generators and
stock up on repair supplies, said Myrt Wesphal, director of residential life. They will also secure loose materials in the construction
sites at the Science Center and the new dorm.
Isabel, a category two hurricane spinning off the coast of North
Carolina, is expected to dump one to three inches of rain on
Delaware County, said John Belugoenski, meteorologist for College
Station, Pa.-based Accuweather. During the height of the storm
from about 3 to 9 a.m. Friday
sustained winds will average 40 to
50 mph, with gusts of 60 mph or more, Belugoenski said.
The National Weather Service has issued an inland

tropical

storm wind watch and a flood watch for Philadelphia and Delaware
Counties for Thursday night and Friday morning.
A tropical storm warning is in effect for the Delaware and New
Jersey shores.
A storm preparation task force, headed by Director of Facilities
Stuart Hain and Westphal, will meet at 8:30 a.m. to decide what further preparations are needed.
Whatever happens, students should plan to have class Friday,
and Sharpies will have electricity and heat even if the college loses
power, Westphal said.
She said students should take precautions today to protect their
rooms from water damage.
"If you live in a lower level of a dorm, monitor things and get
your junk off the floor before you go to bed," Westphal said.
The already saturated ground will make flooding and downed
trees more likely.
"The soil is very wet, and it doesn't take much of a wind gust to
take trees down," Belugoenski said.
Only one sports match has been affected by the impending storm.
The cross country meet against Haverford, originally scheduled for
Friday, was played Wednesday night, said Marian Fahy of the athletics department.

Residents from Charleston, S.C., to New York City have been anxiously watching Isabel, and earlier this week forecasters said the
storm might pass directly through the Delaware Valley. It now
appears that the worst of the storm will pass far to the south of
Swarthmore.

"People in Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia are not usually
by any kind of tropical system. To have the eye of a hurricane pass close to Washington, D.C., is a pretty rare event,"

"We try to have control over things, but the weather is one thing
we can't do anything about," Dean of the College Bob Gross said

Kashmir conference to focus on working toward new peace

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Dialgoue for Peace Initiatives symosium will try to create Statement of Common Ground
BY BENJAMIN KABAK
bkabakl@Swarthmore.edu
For the first six years of his life, Anmol Tikoo 'O6 lived
in Srinagar, the capital of the highly contested Kashmir
Valley region between the borders of India and Pakistan.
Then, one day, Tikoo's life changed forever. Muslims in
Kashmir told Tikoo's Hindu family that they had to leave
the area.

"When I was six years old, I was told that if my family
did not leave the valley in 24 hours, we would be killed,"
Tikoo said. "We came from Srinagar to live in Delhi in
India. We were refugees in India. We were displaced from
what was our home and forced to grow up in a different
place than what was actually our home."
Now, more than 13 years since Tikoo and his family
were forced out of his home, over 70 thousand civilians
have died in the Kashmir region. Tikoo wants to see peace
returned to his homeland, and with the help of numerous
students, faculty members and leaders in the academic
world, he has organized a conference with the purpose of
facilitating a better understanding of the Jammu and
Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan.

"We want this conference be more
than intellectual rambling. We want
it to affect dialogue and the
outcomes in Kashmir."
Anmol Tikoo 'O6
Prominent journalists, professors and peace activists
will lead the conference, entitled Dialogues for Peace
Initiatives: Kashmir, this weekend at Swarthmore. This
symposium is the first of its kind hosted by the student
group Dialogue for Peace Initiatives. Furthermore, the
conference will be the largest event ever in the United
States on the Kashmir and Jammu conflict. With major
Asian and international media outlets watching the conference, the participants hope to work toward a Statement
of Common Ground and form a launching pad for peace
efforts in the Kashmir and Jammu region.
Opening dialogues
Tikoo and fellow conference leader Bernadette BairdZars 'O6, whose parents are from India and Kashmir, have
been planning out the Dialogues for Peace Initiatives (DPI)
since their freshmen orientation in August 2002. "We were
sitting down in Sharpies over lunch and were talking with
another student and the idea just came up," Baird-Zars
said. "We were talking about the amazing opportunities we
have at Swarthmore to do things. This seems like a logical

utilization of the resources we have."

Tikoo and Baird-Zars, along with a group of students,
developed DPI. "The first conference is going to be a part
of a much more institutionalized conflict management program at this and other college," Tikoo said. "We hope to
disseminate information on global conflicts."
Based on Tikoo and Baird-Zars's plans, DPI will host
numerous conferences focusing on peace-building initiatives. The leaders want DPI to "provide a better understanding of conflicts and other relevant issues; equip people with skills that would be useful for peace, social justice, and humanitarian work; and connect different organizations and people having an interest in humanitarian
issues."
So far, in its earliest development stages, DPI has won
the support of the Cooper Foundation and the Lang Center
for Social Justice. Outside of Swarthmore, prominent

DIALOGUE FOR PEACE INITIATIVES: "KASHMIR
peace groups and social justice organizations, including
the Youth Initiative for Peace and political commentator
Noam Chomsky, have lent their support to DPI.

Putting together a Kashmir conference
For the first conference, Dialogue for Peace Initiatives:
Kashmir, Tikoo and Baird-Zars have gathered leading academics and activists to lead three panel discussions on the
Kashmir solution. With 15 different guests lined up, every
speaker comes to the conference with a different angle on
the Kashmir conflict. "It's a very heterogeneous community there," Tikoo echoed. "We are trying to represent as
many different sides as we can. We have 15 speakers who
give us a good overview of the eclectic spectrum of opinions."
"The two main goals, as we saw it, were to educate people and to spring them into action," Baird-Zars said.
"We're not partisan in any way, but it's controversial even
to hold a conference about it because India doesn't want
any third-party negotiators in the conflict. Pakistan does
because they see it in their interest right now."
Baird-Zars and Tikoo secured 15 prominent members of
the Indian and Pakistani communities in both America
and the world to present their viewpoints at the symposium. Usmaan Ahmad, a member of the Jammu Kashmir
Liberation Front, Kasmiri author Sudha Koul, and Deepa
Ollapally, an expert on the nuclear aspects of the conflict
are among those scheduled to attend the conference this
weekend.
On Friday, the conference will open with a welcome
address and movie, followed by a discussion led by Abir
Bazaz, a Kashmiri filmmaker. The main focus of the conference, to be presented at Friday's opening sessions, is to
build cooperation in preparation for the Statement of

Common Ground.
"This conference will end with a Statement on Common
Ground," Tikoo said. "We don't want people to come
together for a three-day even and then, boom, it will all fall
apart. We want to come out of it with something concrete."
"It will be very difficult to produce this statement,"

Baird-Zars said, "but it's worth it to produce some piece
that can be carried on from this conference, some conclusion. Maybe it's just a paragraph, but we hope that people
can feel that there is some product from us and be inspired
to do something."
On Saturday, the first panel will focus on the historical
roots of the Kashmir conflict. The afternoon will feature a
cultural performance, and the second panel on "Human
Rights, the Nuclear Threat and Consequences of the
Conflict." The evening sessions feature trust-building
workshops and the cultural evening.
On Sunday, the conference concludes with a panel
called "Confidence Building Measures, Public Policy
Changes, Possible Solutions, Sustainable Peace." After
another round of trust-building workshops, the conference
will conclude with the highly-anticipated Statement of
Common Ground.
The main thrust of this conference, according to the
organizers, is to get people from different sides of the issue
talking to each other, and this is where the trust-building
workshops come in. "Most of the people have never talked
to each other, even though they've been active in the conflict their entire lives," Baird-Zars said.
In the end, Tikoo feels that the payoff for the conference
will be the effectiveness of the joint statement. Tikoo and
Baird-Zars both acknowledge that this would be the first
statement of its kind in the Kashmir conflict, and they
hope that those who attend the conference will pursue the
goals set forth in the statement. "We want this conference
be more than intellectual rambling," Tikoo said. "We want
it to affect dialogue and the outcomes in Kashmir.
Everyone will have a share in the peace process."
Those attending the conference recognize the importance of the Statement of Common Ground, as well. "My
hopes are high, but aspirations are realistic," Adil Najam,
a Pakistani professor who teaches at Tufts and Boston
University, said in an interview posted by DPI. "One conference cannot solve the problem, but maybe it can move
the conversation from one that focuses on the reasons for
conflict to thinking about the benefits from peace."

before that, a new McAfee virus definition

replaced key electronic systems that were
proving most susceptible to the virus.
"By Saturday afternoon, we were starting to see virus traffic diminish significantly," Dumic said. "Since then, we've
been stable."
That was not, however, before the campus firewall encountered serious difficulties in two separate incidents on both
Friday and Saturday. On Saturday, it was
removed in favor of a newer firewall.
"[The virus] killed the firewall,"
Jacobsen said. "It's like a traffic cop in the
middle of New York City. Usually you have
a few thousand visitors, but when you have
a million visits, you get overwhelmed."
Part of the problem, Dumic said, is that
each year students come to campus with
more powerful computers. In the case of
this particular virus, the more processing
power an infected computer had, the more
randomly generated addresses the virus
could make it search for, increasing its

In a world of mass production and
genetic modification, freshly grown
fruit can taste so different from typical
fruit that, well, it's like comparing
apples to oranges.
Every fall, Swarthmore throws off
the shackles of bland and unsavory
fruit, opting instead for the delectable
produce of small growers from the
Swarthmore area.
The grower of choice for the past
three years has been Indian Orchards, a
five-acre orchard in Middletown, Pa.,
that has been family-owned since 1914.
Janet Kassab, puchasing director for

Protestors deliver
message to Bush
BY SUE CHEN
schenl@swarthmore.edu

About 50 Swarthmore students waited for an hour in the rain
for the chance to shout a comment of protest at President George
W. Bush, who was on his way to a campaign fund raiser dinner

in Upper Darby on Monday.

Students waved homemade signs reading "I Love Breathing,"
"Bush Doesn't Care about Clean Air," "Equality in Education
Now!" while waiting for the president to pass by.
As Bush drove past just before 6 p.m, the protestors chanted
slogans, including "Save the tree, lose the Bush" and "Bush says
warfare, we say health care." Many also booed at the motorcade.
"We definitely know Bush saw us as he was driving by," Joe
Alberti 'O6 said. "I think he got an idea that there was a stir

going on."

The students were protesting many of Bush's policies, rang-

ing from the war in Iraq to tax cuts to educationreform. Those
who attended said they wanted to make the president aware how
many people were against his policies and election campaign.
Joe Florence 'O4 said he heard about the protest from the
local Sierra Club and invited Swarthmore organizations such as
Earthlust, College Democrats, Why War? and Good Schools PA
to protest.
Many of the protestors were members of Swarthmore's newly
formed Sierra Club who wanted to raise public awareness of
Bush's Clear Skies Initiative, which eases pollution-control
measures for power plants and factories.
"We just wantto draw attention to the fact a lot of his policies
are rolling back key environmental laws that are getting very
minimal press coverage," Sierra Club intern and media coordinator Michael Drezner 'O7 said. "Because people are not
informed, there is no outcry."
"I think it's really important to build citizen support against
his campaign," Florence said. "We've got to stop Bush."
Dinner guests each paid $2,000 for a chance to see the president and eat a meal of cheesesteaks and hoagies. Bush raised
SL4 million from Monday night's event, The Philadelphia
Inquirer reported on Sept. 16.
"We're going to give our two cents, because we can't give our
2000 dollars," local protestor Amanda Cundiff said.

of Republicans, The Inquirer reported.
In addition to Swarthmore students, there were also around
200 antiwar protestors from the area protesting a few blocks
down the road, Florence said.
Not everyone who showed up on Monday was there to criticize the president. As the Swarthmore protesters were leaving,
a man driving out of the nearby parking lot rolled down his window, waved a small American flag, and chanted, "We love Bush."

Qüb to reopen this month
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX

ldremeal@swarthmore. edu

People around campus know who ran Qiib
last year. They know the college's only late-night
weekend cafe hasn't opened yet, and some of
them are wondering why.
Joey Roth 'O6, one of Qub's founders and
managers, said that, when people ask him about
the cafe, "it's almost an accusation, like they're
mad at us
which I guess is good."
Lack of money and space are the two obstacles facing Qiib's reopening
but only for the
moment. Wynn Wu 'O4, another founder, said the
group needed a "small amount of seed money"
from the college to pay for the first order of food.
After that, food sales would probably allow Qiib
to break even.

But co-founder Dan Yue 'O5 emphasized that,
regardless of whether the managers get the full
amount they request from the college, Qiib will
be open this semester, probably by the end of the

month.

AN Abunimah discusses his ideas for a one-state solution.

Palestinian journalist
argues for one state
BY BREE BANG-JENSEN

bbangjel@swarthmore.edu

Students packed the Scheuer room
on Monday to hear Palestinian journalist Ali Abunimah argue for a onestate solution to the beleaguered
Middle East peace process.
Abunimah said he regretted the
current media focus on whether
killing Arafat was legitimate rather
than how to handle the "separation
wall" proposed by many Israelis. He
supplemented his presentation with
slides from his Web site, The
Electronic Intifada.
Abunimah said he did not believe
the conflict could be traced back to an
individual or side. "If you take group
A and group B and put them in one
space, and group A has all the advantages
economic, military, social
and group B has none, there will be
conflict. That is true everywhere in
the world," he said.
Although he originally embraced

a two-state solution, Abunimah discussed his growing frustration with
the Bush administration and its
"road map" peace plan.
"The road map was worth a
chance
there was nothing else out
there," he said. Now he thinks the
only answer may be a one-state solution.
Many students felt encouraged by
the dialogue. "I never really believed
in a one-state solution, but listening
to him somehow convinced me it
could happen," Anita Kumar 'O6 said.
Henry Swift 'O7 added that "it was
very refreshing to hear someone discussing what is the most effective
solution rather than what is the
'right' solution."

member of Students Against the
Occupation who helped arrange the

THE PHOENIX

Last winter, Qiib received funds from the college for startup costs, then got by on its own for
the rest of the semester. Although managers got
paid for shifts in the kitchen, they were never
compensated for cleanup, setup and additional
time spent running the cafe.
"The one thing Qiib is a little deficient at is
paying the managers," Yue said.
The managers plan to start with Thursday
and Friday night runs only, with the possible
addition of Friday afternoon takeout, Yue said.
Over the summer, Qiib cooks made sushi for faculty and staff to bring home, something they

hope to continue at the start of each weekend in
Parrish or Tarble during the school year.
A few unpopular dishes that require too
much preparation will probably be dropped,
Roth said, including nori tea rice and eel donburi, another rice dish. Sushi and bubble tea are
the cafe's biggest sellers, and the cooks plan to
"work on bubble tea quality consistency" and
offer more flavors.
Roth will manage Qiib this year with Alex
Braunstein 'O5, Janice Im 'O6 and Mark Chang
'O6, while co-founders Yue and Wu will focus on
the cafe's finances.
The tiny kitchen in Kaori Kitao Gallery prevented Qiib from making as much food as it
wanted to last semester. Roth said he thought
the kitchen was seven feet by six feet and "made
to feel much smaller by the presence of a stove,
fridge, and cabinets. Only one person could be in
there at a time."
One solution, he said, may be to use another
campus kitchen exclusively for takeout preparation, with its own dedicated staff. The cooking
staff may also expand into part of the dining
room. But lack of seating room was a problem
last year, and the Qiib staff does not want to
make it worse. Wu said he saw people walk in
last semester and leave right away, simply
because there was no room.
"We're thinking that, if it's warm outside, we
could put chairs and tables out there and make a
patio with paper lanterns," Roth said.
He added that making a profit, something the
managers once aspired to, is no longer a realistic goal for them. "Now I see it more as a service
and something I really enjoy doing," he said.

A slice of Sharples: simple, sumptuous seminar snacks
BY REBECCA ENNEN

rennenl@swarthmore.edu

An opportunity to cook for others is a blessing. In particular, I love to "bring break" for class; it's a chance to
impress my peers via something other than my (unimpressive) intellect. It was thus shocking to overhear my
close friend lan Flora 'O5 moaning about his Roman
Emperors co-seminarian: "She, like, set the bar way too
high! She brought apples and hard-boiled eggs [part of a
traditional Roman feast]! And two whole apple pies ..."
lan's classmate Lisa Hunter 'O6 clutched herself in semisuppressed panic, adding wretchedly, "There's no way
that anyone normal can do that." I nearly choked on my
supper. Listen, folks. It's not that hard. Bringing break is
a chance to share the pleasure of fine food with your fel-

low students.
My instinct here is to write a sweet, auntly column,
urging you to see cooking as meditative and suggesting
gently that our collective quality of life could be enriched
by more thoughtful provisioning of class breaks. That
tone is, however, ill-suited to the enormity of the problem
at hand: Our campus is caught in a maelstrom of culinary
disasters.
Let's analyze the typical break snack. We have a Starch
(pretzels, Triscuits, potato chips) with accompanying Dip
(salsa from a jar, hummus, something creamy and greenflecked), a Fruit or Vegetable (grapes and baby carrots,
inevitably) and a Beverage. Menus get a little better for
evening seminars
french bread, brie, and wine are frequent offerings. Now, there is nothing inherently wrong
with the above selection, save that it is The Same Thing
Everyone Brings. Repetition breeds discontent.
The Starch-Dip-Fruit-Vegetable (SDFV) menu is actually an excellent model. One ought to go beyond the tired and
obvious, though. I recognize that most students do not have
the benefit of my (off-campus) kitchen or my (maniacal)
culinary zeal. Preparing a special snack doesn't have to
take a lot of time, expertise or cookware. Plus, cooking is

soothing to the harried mind and satisfying to the bruised
ego. Your classmates will swoon over your luscious cookies
even if your seminar paper is dry and tasteless.

So, what makes a perfect snack? The standard SDFV
options are deadly, not only because they are common, but
also because they are ill-paired. There is a difference

between 'fusion cuisine' and 'unintentional mish-mash."
Doritos may taste fine with hummus, but the combination
does not constitute a satisfying snack. Pick a regional or
cultural theme and go from there. Hummus goes well with
pita triangles, olives and sliced cucumber rounds. In my
sophomore year, Stefanie Fox 'O4 and I prepared a "tea"
for our class, including watercress and cucumber sandwiches, pumpkin-poppy seed muffins, and lemon-almond
cake with strawberries. (There was no actual tea, because,
well, we couldn't figure out how to keep it hot.) A wellmade menu harmonizes into a "whole" that is better than
the sum of its parts.
One aspect of break planning is that snacks should
refresh and recharge the snacker. Try to include some
foods that are dense and satisfying. Thick, chewy brownies
or savory, rich dips are equally good ways to accomplish
this. One does not need tremendous variety within any one
break menu; a single delicious snack is better than a selection of mediocre ones. Likewise, truly spectacular snacks
may be sufficiently wonderful to override the 'theme' rule
above: Lela Patrik 'O4 and Blair Cochran 'O3 once made
cheesecake, tofu cheesecake and bean dip, an unorthodox
yet delicious combination. Be sure, though, to provide
alternatives for those whose tastes or dietary habits are
not the same as yours. Have pity on the vegans.
The recipes below are written with a dorm kitchen in
mind, i.e., very little cookware. All ingredients are available in the Ville.
A final point is that one should be generous and open
when judging other people's menu-planning. An adventurous friend of mine told me this sad story: "I brought a
selection of stuffed buns from Chinatown [to seminar],
and the other students thought it was gross. My professor
acted offended. One student conspicuously went to the coffee bar." Her callous classmates deserve a scolding and a
lesson in gracious acceptance of generosity. Please, gentle
reader, do not scorn the untried and untasted!
One postscript: Please, people, no more Turkey Hill

The Ultimate Dip for the Tortilla Chip
Credit is due to Lela Patrik 'O4, whose break-cookery is

without compare. Serves 20+.
1 can refried beans

1 ripe avocado (should be squeezable)
1 jar salsa
1 can corn
Mash the avocado in a bowl. Add the beans and salsa.
Drain the com and mix it in. Serve with tortilla chips. (If
a microwave is available near your classroom, nuke the
dip on med-high for a minute to bring out the flavors.)
Rosemary Rolls
The smell of warmed rosemary is absolutely dizzying.

Serves 10.

1 lump pizza dough (ask for it at Renato's or check the
fancy-cheese area at Genuardi's)
olive oil
dried rosemary
salt
Preheat oven to 400S F. Cut or tear dough into 10
pieces. Oil a cookie sheet or piece of aluminum foil
lightly. Stretch the dough pieces into rounds (think
English muffins or mini-focaccia) and use your fingertips
or a fork to make indentations in each piece. Drizzle
with oil and sprinkle with salt and rosemary. Bake
15-20 minutes, until nicely browned. Serve warm if possible.
Chewy Peanut Chocolate Bars
The easiest recipe ever. I learned it from a kids' cookbook in grade school. Memorize it today. Serves 12 or
fewer. (Don't expect leftovers.)
1 cup peanut butter
1 cup sugar
1 egg or egg substitute equivalent
1 cup chocolate chips
Preheat oven to 375 e F. Mix the first three ingredients
together thoroughly. Spread evenly in a pan and bake
until set, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and
sprinkle chips over the top. Allow chips to melt slightly,
then spread chocolate over surface. Cool before cutting.

Quasi, Hot Shit
Quasi's finest album, 1998's Featuring Birds, starts with half
a minute of chaotic banging and skrawking, the sounds of primitive machinery going berserk, which bears little relation to,
and even sharply contrasts, with the precise, tuneful and
almost mechanical pop-rock that dominates the work.
Conversely (or contrapositively?), the bed of cinematic, organlike synths that open "Hot Shit," the Portland duo's fifth fulllength album, while certainly sinister, don't prepare us for the
Quasi
raw humanness of the discordant slide-guitar licks that graduHot Shit
ally overtake the synths. There's more humanity here than on
Touch and Go,
past
Quasi discs, partly due to the prominence of guitars over
2003
Sam Coomes' beloved Roxichord synthesizer. The rawer edges
of the album are also due to the increased expressive power of Coomes' vocals, which
are sometimes joined by those of (Sleater-Kinney drummer and ex-wife) Janet Weiss.
The tunes are much looser in both composition and execution, many sporting a distinct blues influence (Coomes released an album of blues covers last year as the Blues
Goblins), but also, I'm sorry to say, a marked inconsistency of quality. For every high
point (the appropriately-titled tempo-shifting "Good Time Rock'n'Roll," the folksy
stomp "Master and Dog,," and the eerily tender lullaby "No One,") there are at least
as many less successful tracks that either approximate the endearingly heavy-handed
10-fi-prog of earlier albums without the requisite melodic charm or stab in new directions without much authenticity. Coomes' trademark cynicism remains intact, in
lyrics that tend towards the political more than ever, either very thinly veiled ("the
elephant wields the rod/while the donkey throws you a bone") or stupidly blatant
("White Devil's Dream" offers cursory and echo-laden 'fuck-you's to the Bushes,
Ashcroft, Rumsfeld, et al), but he also offers a hint of hope. Just before a final descent
into surrealism, "Good Times" (which opens with some gospel sampling) finishes off
its litany of social ills with some arena-style riffs and a sarcastic-but-not-irredeemably
so promise: "good times, happy days/in spite of it all." As long as you're not too picky,
that might be a fitting summation for this album. This shit is, indeed, quasi-hot.

Town and Country, 5
Neither country-western nor township jive (what a nifty
that would be!), the music of this Chicago ensemble
which, while theoretically evocative, doesn't conjure up any
specific locale for me, rural or urban
doesn't yet entirely gainsay their moniker. They share an ideological sophistication
with contemporary art ("classical") music (that would be the
town part), and their shtick, such as it is, is an oldfangled insistence on employing only acoustic instruments to make their
noise (there's something country about that, right?) The basic
Town and
approach here is drone
think, just for fun, of the tone processCountry
ing of someone like Keith Fullerton Whitman, but executed with5
out the aid of electronics. So, on this fifth release (titled after the
Jockey, 2003
Thrill
likes of Lenny Kravitz and Joan Baez), we get things such as
opener "Sleeping in the midday sun," which takes ten minutes to
build from sustained tone-clusters played on cornet, viola, and double bass (fun fact
bassist Josh Abrams is a Philly native and founding member of the Roots) to a veritable rhythmic frenzy of chekere and triangle. Up next is "Aubergine," a blend of gently
repeated chimes and lingering bass clarinet that feels startingly static by contrast.
"Lifestyled" offers some inspired jangling and sawing, and "Shirtless" blossoms into a
nice mechanistic thrumming rhythm, but essentially there's not a whole lot of variation among these six tracks.
Needless to say, Town and Country are functioning rather outside the realm of pop
music; their provenance and label affiliations would suggest tagging them post-rock
but that isn't quite right either. When you get right down to it, there are only a few
very limited ways to approach this music within a context of band names, song titles

Clearly, freshmen are stupid. But we didn't need that pointed out to us.
If being famous has taught us anything, it is that people try
to copy you. Like when all the lacrosse team at Swarthmore
stopped wearing clean underwear in honor of our famous
"three-week rotation cycle." Last week, when Gerrit and Mac
made their debut in The Phoenix as a not-so-multiculturalcopy
of us, was no different than any other famous week in our
famous lives. And yes, while their point was a valid one
(freshmen are really stupid, like that freshman who thought he
weighed more than Emiliano), it was an obvious one, and thus
their point backfired, and they
inadvertently labeled themselves as the stupid ones. This
column is all about proving
how we are funnier, cooler,

hotter and famouser than
Gerrit and Mac. Freshmen, we
would say to check The

Gerrit's stupid columns, but
you would be too stupid to figure it out. Withoutfurther ado,

BY EMILY GASSER

I may be a stupid freshman, but I do know that one
of the essentials of college life is eating plenty of pizza.
But which pizzerias are any good? Aside from some
vague rumors about a place with a $5.99 large pie, my
friends couldn't give me any help; they're new here,
too. (We stupid freshmen tend to band together.) So
rather than wallow in my ignorance, I boldly went
where most Swarthmore students have gone before and
embarked on a quest to find the best pizza in the

Swarthmore area.
My first foray into the world of pizza at Swarthmore
was last week at a study break featuring purity tests
and a pie from Renato's. Definitely not the best first
impression. By the time it arrived, the pizza was lukewarm. The cheese was thick and tough, the crust was
soggy, and the oil dripped down all our wrists. "I don't
like it," reported Sarah Bryan 'O5. "It's too greasy and
there's just not enough crust."
For the next sampling, I recruited three friends to
lend their taste buds: Nina Thanawala, Kannie Chim
and Jonathan Ference, all of 'O7. Appetito's was nice
enough to let me order a pizza an hour and a half in
advance, so it would arrive right after my last morning
class ended. They were prompt, too. The pizza itself was
better than Renato's, good but not great. It was very
cheesy and filling, but, according to Chim, "too salty".
As Ference put it, "It's pretty good fast food pizza. It'll
fill the void, but it's not the greatest pizza in the world."
We were all inclined to agree.
According to the manager, Appetito's delivers over
100 pizzas every week to the Swarthmore campus. Its
most popular varieties are pepperoni and white with
broccoli, and they also offer salads, strombolis, cheese
steaks and other Italian entrees. Aside from the student
specials, everything on the menu has a $1 delivery
charge. Said the manager, "Think of it as part of the tip.
It helps us pay for the gas money to get to and from
Next up was Papa John's, which Thanawala tried at
a debate meeting. "It's better than most big chain pizzas," she said. "But the sauce was too sweet. I have a

grudge against sweet sauces."

the reserved-students e-mails column last

semester was funny. We would have come up with it ourselves
if we weren't so famous. You see, we famous, cool, hot and nonstupid people do not have time to check our e-mail, much less
to read reserved-students e-mails. Our secretaries filter all that
useless stuff out.
3) Gerrit and Mac are not hot. Gerrit once wrote in his April
24 column, speaking of his major, "Isaac Newton died a virgin."
So will Gerrit and Mac.
4) In the July 12 issue of The Phoenix, Gerrit and Mac
allegedly wrote: "Do you like green eggs and ham? Yes, I like
them, Sam I am." We don't know about you all, but we're
opposed to reading anyone who plagiarizes dead children's

Massachusetts, thought it was "really good." Essie
Mae's is also good. Chim was too sick of pizza by this
point to try any, but Thanawala was hardy enough to
join me for a slice. We agreed that it was better than the
Renato's from our study break, though the sauce was
slightly sweet and the crust lacked crunch. "It's not
very greasy," she said. "I mean, pizza's always greasy,
but it's not that greasy." And considering Essie Mae's
pizza can be paid for with a meal rather than cash, I'd
prefer it to ordered pizza during the snack bar's hours.
So where do more pizza-savvy Swatties order their
pies? Acapulco's seems to get the best marks, for price
as well as flavor. "They're cheap," said Chris Rose 'O5.
Dan Shargel 'O4 agreed: "Acapulco's student special is a
really good deal. And despite my lukewarm experience,
Renato's has its supporters. "Their pepperoni is really
good,"

Jaime Cardenos 'O7 declared.

Acapulco's likes us, too. "They are nice students,"
said the manager. "They are very good."
A poll of my hall revealed that, in addition to having
the best prices, Acapulcos also has the best-looking
delivery guys. But be careful: "I had a really sketchy
one hit on me last year," Stephanie Rogan 'O6 said.
Joanna Seavey 'O6 was also skeptical. "Last year, all the
pizza guys who came here were, like, 50 years old."
The biggest problem seems to be timeliness of deliveries, and Appetito's wins the prize for most hopelessly
lost deliverymen. Sam Faeder 'O7 complained that they
"took an hour to get here, and then when they called we
went to the door, but they weren't there!" But the true
tale of pizza horror comes from Kirsten Vannice 'O4.
"Over Labor Day, I ordered a pizza from Appetito's,"
she said. "I waited 45 minutes, and it didn't come, so I
called them, and they told me, 'lt's Labor Day, and we're
really busy, so you'll have to come pick it up.' So I was
about to leave, and they called me back, saying "Never
mind. It's on its way.' Then, a while later, the guy called
me back to tell me that he'd made a mistake; it was
someone else's pizza that they'd delivered, and I still
had to pick mine up. The whole thing took over and

hour and a half."
The employees I talked to at the local pizzerias all
denied any interesting or unusual experiences while
delivering to the dorms. If I weren't so skeptical, I'd
take that as a challenge.

When your libido

Wren return after seven years
BY BRANDY MONK-PAYTON

it came out sounding. From a technical end, it
sounds pretty good.

The elusive status of rock star is hungrily
sought out by teenage garage bands, blissfully
hopeful contestants on American Idol, and even the
occasional eight-year-old, when asked what he
wants to be when he grows up. Some people, like
the members of the band The Wrens, will just never
be content to be regular joes. The New Jersey-based
band is coming to Swarthmore Sept. 26 to play a 10
p.m. show at the Olde Club and is composed of four
guys (Charles, Jerry, Greg and Kevin) who,
through 13 years of music, have finally seemed to

find a balance between the normal aspects of life
and the sometimes surreal world of the recording
industry. After several years of hiatus after their
album "Secaucus" released in 1996, The Wrens are
back in action. In this interview, band member
Charles offers his thoughts on the band, their new
album "The Meadowlands" released Sept. 9, and
whether he feels like he's his own inner rock star.
When and how did your band form?
The band formed around 1989-1990. Kevin and
Greg are brothers, and they were recording some

songs and sending tapes up trying to get shows. We
had a gig in Northern Jersey with an 1980s band
called Fixx. They knew Kevin from playing at
mutual friends' parties. It was in between a jam
session and beer-filled karaoke
it was odd. The
spring of 1990, we auditioned new drummers. Kevin
knew Jerry's girlfriend, so he auditioned. Thirteen
years, later here we are.
...

The Wrens is an interesting name. Is there a
meaning behind it?
We started out with a bunch of different names.
Ten years ago, we had our first vinyl record and
went through a phase where we wanted to keep the
same name for good. We had decided to go with
name Low, but that was already taken by a band in
Minnesota. Birds and flowers were a recurrent
theme in the process; we were almost The
Daffodils. The Wrens was established from there.
When you enter the studio, do you have a definite plan for what you want to accomplish with
a new record, or is it just improvisational?
We recorded everything at home, which takes
the pressure off. It's definitely not improv. We
ended up changing stuff, and it's a long, tiring
process. We started in 1999, writing songs on
acoustic. We were close to finishing up and realized
it wasn't the kind of record we wanted to make. So
we sat down and, instead of starting over from
scratch, we built on music already made
not the
most efficient way of doing things.
...

What are you proudest of on the new record?
I'm personally proud of the mixing and the way

ly?

The Pixies
there are so many. It could be a band
or just one record that still sounds like the artist
from track to track.
...

How long have you guys known each other? Do
you find that the chemistry between you was
instant, or a slow process?
We basically lived with each other all 13 years.
We know each other so well. Even at this point it's
almost like family. The chemistry between us was
a relatively slow process. We certainly all got
along. What kind of keeps the band going is to have
certain shared experiences that you can relate to
all the time.

Is the band a large supporter of constant touring to increase the fan base?
We went to Europe twice and around the country six to 10 times. The level that we were at before,
like doing three shows in a row with five people at
each one, got mentally wearing. For now, we will
continue doing shows a little more low key until
there's a reason to warrant more touring.
How was the ride to success for the band? Was
it an easy or gradual path?
So much stuff has happened in the last couple of
months. It has been really wonderful. After a period of five years of doing nothing and now this. We
weren't doing phone interviews then, so that's a
really cool morale booster. It's been a nifty couple
of months to have this stuff happening. Our success
has been pretty gradual. Looking back, what looked
like a lot of money on the table
that was another
type of success. That happened very quickly. We
became more wary of those out-of-the-blue, toogood-to-be-true deals. We are having a real reward...

ing experience now.
Do you consider yourself a rock star? How has
your life and your bandmates' lives changed

since signing a record deal?
No, I don't consider myself a rock star. Our lives
definitely haven't changed. Between the four of us,
[stability and each other] definitely keep us in line.
Has the business side of the industry jaded you
in any way?
We certainly have our story as far as opportunity and money. It's really not bad. We have had
bizarre plots and turns, but ultimately our ending
is happy. We came to realize that some opportunities weren't really good. We are pretty happy and
confident and comfortable with choices we've
made.

September 18, 2003

Although he has never exactly said it, I am sure that my
boyfriend would be elated if I were half as interested in actually
having sex as I am in talking about sex. Let's face it. For people at
Swat constantly fighting a losing battle with an academic workload, fooling around or masturbating are not
always top priorities. Even when I
genuinely want to make time for
hooking up, there are so many other
ways to spend my precious free
moments that sometimes something
like working out just takes precedence. This is unfortunate, however.
Orgasms, whether they occur alone
or with a partner, have been shown
to decrease stress and increase serotonin, the brain chemical which triggers feelings of happiness. Libido differs by the person and should not be

an issue unless you make it one, but
when one partner desires sex much
Sex and the Swattie
more or less than the other, conflict

can arise within an otherwise wonderful relationship. In a relationship
both partners should always respect the wishes of the other, so if
you're comfortable with your level of sexual desire, your partner
needs to be supportive. That said, if you are concerned that your
level of sexual desire and/or enjoyment is low, I've listed some of
the common causes.
The first thing you should examine is whether your level of
sexual desire has declined around the same time you began taking
a new medication. Certain birth control pills, ironically, can cause
a drop in libido. Switching to a pill lower in estrogen and higher
in progestin can quickly remedy this. If you feel that your Pill
might be zapping your sexual energy, talk to Linda Echols, director of Worth, and she will prescribe a different brand.
Antidepressants also significantly affect sexual desire and
response in about 20 percent of cases.
The Swat lifestyle may also be the culprit. Fatigue and stress can
fog our minds and prevent our systems from functioning optimally.
In this instance, more sex (especially masturbation because of its
time and orgasmic efficiency) may be one of the best remedies, as it
decreases stress hormones and can increase energy. Similarly, regular exercise has been shown to have a huge impact on sexual energy, ability to orgasm, and overall happiness. Alas, it takes energy to
get energy, so fight workout boredom by fantasizing about all the
hot sex you will (or could be) having this weekend.
Sometimes enjoyment, not desire, is the core of the problem,
especially for those of us with vaginas. Vaginal infections are
extremely common and very un-fun, especially during sex. Yeast
infections and vaginal bacteriosis can both cause vaginal irritation, itching, or pain during vaginal penetration. If you experience
any of these symptoms, make an appointment at Worth to get an
exam and medication. Your partner may also have to be treated.
Another cause of pain during sex is an allergy to latex. If you experience pain, irritation, or a rash during or after exposure to latex
condoms or dental dams, try switching to polyurethane, which are
available at Worth.
The other big factor that might be causing you to develop mysterious headaches whenever your partner turns out the lights
might be that you just plain aren't enjoying sex that much. For
instance, if your partner is constantly focusing on penetration (e.g.,
vaginal or anal), but it really doesn't ring your bell, you absolutely
need to talk to him or her about it. Trust me, even though it may be
a difficult topic to broach, in the long run it will be beneficial to you

both.
I'm not going to examine how emotional and psychological
issues can affect sexual desire, only because it is far too complex for
me to even begin to delve into. I will say that, if you feel your lack
of enjoyment is related to an emotional issue (e.g., you don't feel
comfortable with yourself as a sexual person), please talk to someone from psych services, a queer peer counselor, or a SMART member (if you are a survivor of sexual abuse or assault).
It's difficult to make time for sexual pleasure when most of us
run our lives according to our day planners. Although sexual spontaneity can be really hot, it isn't always an option for the overbooked, over-stressed among us, so why not schedule it in?
(Actually writing it in is optional, of course.) Who knows

Swatties hold the key in
the war of the coffee bars
BY JOHN TUTHILL
jtuthill@swarthmore.edu
I have a hernia so I don't drink much coffee, but I do eat
citric acid and sometimes I buy candy at the coffee bar,
where Lemon Heads are only a quarter. But for those who
like swilling the black caffeine drink there are more choices than ever before.
Indeed, there are now two coffee vending establishments on campus, Kohlberg, Swat's trusty of Ford, and the
recently-opened sushi bar in the new science building, a
freshly purchased red Chevy. Our trusty of Ford has been
catering to Swarthmore students for five years while
assembling a formidable gang of loyal customers. Two of
Swarthmore's most lovely and celebrated personalities
haunt Kohlberg's counter daily with their lively bellowing
and friendliness. But the ladies who work the new register
are charming and they sell sushi. How will the addition of
this new red Chevy upset the former tranquility of the
Swarthmore coffee scene?
Kohlberg is faithfully plush and inviting: There are
chairs for catnaps and a cozy atmosphere prevails amongst
the grand, structurally functionless pillars. The bar sells
coffee, tea, chai, juice and other drinks, as well as sandwiches and bagels and various wholesome citric acid
snacks.
But it is the Detroit-designed-and-produced engine of the
machine that is most impressive
the clean and efficient
duo of Michelle and Katie. They have worked at
Swarthmore for a combined 21 years, in the dining haU and
at Essie Mae's. They've finally settled in a lively niche in
the Kohlberg coffee bar, where they cool our passions or
warm our coffee with equal competence. Michelle and
Katie speak fondly and candidly of the folks that visit them
each day: the woman from the Ville who walks her dog, a
student who once took their intimidating bawling to heart,
a professor who has the gout.
"We see them coming down the walkway through the
window and by the time they're here we've got their chai
ready for them," Michelle said as she rummaged through
the closet behind the bar.
Not only is their chai ready, but the regular customer
may enjoy the spirited banter as Katie and Michelle work
their magic. Each morning, these animated women screech
like a pair of pelicans at the jumbled line facing the coffee

A lesson in the

I've already gotten a sneak preview of aerial dance
troupe Project Bandaloop, but everyone else will have
to wait until Sept. 20 for their performance at

Swarthmore.

It happened by chance. As I was sitting in front of
the Cheese Court on Tuesday, calmly reading "Six Ideas
That Shaped Physics" and sipping green tea, I got an
impromptu performance of Project Bandaloop's own
giddy brand of velocity.
I thought I'd found the perfect study spot
quiet
and directly shaded by that nice tree in front of the
Cheese Court. So at first I was annoyed when the two
tan and wiry women sat down with their plate of cheese
and rolls at the tiny metal table next to me and started

bar.

"I think people are tired and cranky in the morning and
need something to lighten up their day," Katie explained.
"We just might make somebody's day a little bit less serious; and we really do need to move the line." In a sense,
Katie and Michelle are those two tricksters that put the
whoopee cushion under the owl's nest, and make that wise
old stoic jump and then maybe even chuckle under his
standard early-morning frown.
The new addition to the coffee bar economy can be
found located in the large hall of the eastern wing of the
new Science Center. The tables and chairs create a more
austere, studious atmosphere, which is broken daily when
students fill the hall with their loud voices and tremendous
clunking book bags. The Science Center Coffee Bar has all
the bells and whistles and shines like the new truck it
resembles. The menu includes sushi and soup and quiche
as well as the student's suet, a fine cup of coffee.
The gears that turn to run the new coffee bar are slightly less familiar to students, though the two wonderful
ladies who work there during the day, Laurie Dibeler and
Adele Tracy, also combine for 21 years of service to
Swarthmore. These spry women cater to Swarthmore's scientific community with friendliness and concern.
"This is a great position for a curious person," Laurie
said. "Everybody stops by to tell me about their work, and
as an art major in college, it is fascinating and differentfor
me to learn what is happening in all of these varied fields
of science."
Sushi is delivered daily to the science center by
Margaret Kuo's Tokyo in Media, and has been selling like
hotcakes. Though the margin of profit is low, Laurie said
that the enthusiasm for the sushi they sell each day justifies the item's starting role on the menu. Business is also
bound to pick up when the building is finished and more
hungry traffic passes through.
As for the brutal competition between the two great
American truck manufacturers, it hardly applies in this

Trampoline walls?"
And at that moment, a guy wearing a muscle t-shirt
and yoga pants walked up to the two women and, cheerfully greeting them, proceeded to grab a low limb of my
shade tree and coolly lift his entire body sideways into
the air. He hung there, parallel to the sidewalk, for a
second or two, then flipped around (I still don't know
how it happened, I can't even do a somersault) and
lightly landed on the ground. The two women continued to talk to him and each other as if the arboreal gymnastics display had never occurred.
Yep, that was Project Bandaloop, hanging out in the
Ville and eating some expensive stinky cheese while
waiting for its laundry to be done. Or rather it was two

is the trusty ol' workhorse and the science
coffee bar is the latest model, but in reality each remains
unique and useful. There are few repeats on the two menus,
so the finer points of each establishment will surely be
debated and eventually decided.
The future of the coffee bars remains unclear; they are
now under the same budget operated by dining services.
Whichever venue makes more money will consequently
receive more funds for the next semester. A bitter struggle
might erupt if it were not for the sweetness of all of the
ladies who work at the coffee bars. The e-mails sent out to
faculty and students about the grand opening of the new
sushi bar would infuriate any normal bitter human, but
Katie and Michelle have taken it with decency and grace.
They are comforted daily by those professors from the
science departments who still get their coffee in Kohlberg.
They also swear that they make better chai than those science newbies. Laurie and Adele answer with their elegant
cases of sushi. Time will show, I believe, that each of these
establishments will be frequented by great numbers of nondiscriminatory Swarthmore students.

Amelia Rudolph.
The dancers seemed not to notice my presence (or
my surreptitious looks of awe over at their table) until
I finished my reading and packed up to leave. As I was
putting away my books, Rudolph asked if I was a
Swarthmore student. I said I was and she asked what I
had been reading.
"Oh, just some really basic physics for Astro 3," I
said.
"Physics, huh?" she said. "Well, we're from Project
Bandaloop, the dance group coming to your campus.
We're kind of like physics in motion. We do stuff with
gravity. You should come see us Saturday
maybe
your professor would give you extra credit!"
I laughed, said I would probably need all the extra
credit I could get in Astronomy, and promised to go see

the performance.
So after that incident, I'm definitely going to see all
the dancing, twirling, and rappelling that will go on in
LPAC on Saturday. I might even stop by for one of the
workshops. Not only do I have a promise to keep, I
think my physics studies would benefit from the expe-

rience. As I know from Tuesday's encounter, any meeting with Project Bandaloop is a lesson in the laws of
motion.

Their new album, which bears the ungooglable title Heart, is due out next

folk-poppers Essex Green.
Broken Social Scene, an umpteen-member collectively which apparently
encompasses most of Toronto's underground music scene, have received
much attention lately for their sophomore effort "You Forgot it in People,"
which runs the gamut of indie rock 'n' pop with hints ofnoise and IDM, rendering established styles freshly evocative (says my roommate: "they're definitely not trying to make you feel uncomfortable, but there's still something

User responsibility
The tech-savvy college student has the power to
live like a sedentary spider in the center of a vast web
of information. We can do course readings and independent research, apply for jobs, write columns for
The Phoenix, check out books from McCabe, flirt with
random strangers and satisfy our thirst for movies
and music all from the comfort of our desks, using our
state-of-the-art computers.
Up until recently, anyway. Now we sit through
hours-long shortages, bite our fingernails about RIAA
lawsuits and watch bewilderedly ITS draw more and
more overtime pay out of the endowment.
The very power of the digital web, allowing us to
stretch out our virtual arms across the world to google
obscure trivia and download the Top 40 for free, has
backfired; now the RIAA can reach back to slap us
with lawsuits, and sociopathic 18-year-olds can vomit
their digital contagion over every campus network in
the nation. Suddenly our computers aren't our friends
anymore.
The digital world has really been cursed by its own
success; more powerful computers and faster information propagation makes writing viruses easier and
easier. The very power and convenience of file sharing
has finally made traditional media willing to fight for
its market share. And the outages wouldn't be such a
pain if the Internet hadn't been so convenient and useful in the first place.
So we soldier on. It's tempting to whinge and
whine at ITS to throw more manpower at the problem,
but it's hard to see how anyone could have anticipated
the degree to which network infrastructure has been
rocked by recent change. We've survived; e-mail is
still being sent and Web pages browsed.
Swarthmore's honeymoon with the Internet is over
what was an amazing breakthrough is now a takenfor-granted necessity with more and more problems
looming ahead. The days when we could merrily stroll
about the 'Net with impunity are over; now we
absolutely have to worry about current virus definitions and copyright infringement. Being a dorm tech
has gone from being an occasional, part-time job to a
full-time headache.
If ITS is to deal with the problems successfully, we
as students need to become responsible. We need to listen to what they say instead of blowing it off and letting them clean up the mess. We understand the communal responsibility involved in keeping bathrooms
clean and halls clear; now we should realize that taking care of our "personal computers" is just as much a
part of respecting the needs of our communities.

Bush spin continues
More than half of politics isn't what you say, but
what you leave unsaid.
Did the Bush administration ever actually say that
Saddam Hussein's Iraq was involved in the execution
of the Sept. 11 attack? Of course not. That isn't true.
Everyone in the government, the media and academia
knows it's impossible.
Did the Bush administration make reference to the
horror of the Sept. 11 attack as an emotional argument
for the Iraq invasion? Did they try their level best to
establish some sort of connection, through many convoluted links, between Iraqi government agents and

Al-Qaeda representatives?
Yes. Of course.

The fact that 70 percent of Americans polled by the
Washington Post have now apparently been convinced
(by whom, they won't say) that Hussein was personally involved in planning the attacks would be shocking
to anyone who had a basic knowledge of the facts of
the case. It shouldn't be surprising at all to anyone
who knows how media spin works.

Davis column offensive, pointless
Dear Editor:
While I have come to expect little
from Phoenix columnists, last week's
column "Rounding Third" by Carlton
Davis crossed lines of taste and quality with such flagrance that a response
is demanded. I feel personally moved
to make that response because I am
the neighbor with the "ENDWAR"
sign.

Actually, it isn't a sign. It's a New
York state Purple Heart honorary
license plate given to me by my father,
a decorated Vietnam War veteran and
longtime member of the international-

ly respected "Veterans For Peace."
The column, which had virtually
nothing to do with sports besides its
alternated
premise,
ridiculous

between offensive and

confusing.

There was no clearly discernible point
being made or direction to the "plot."
In the end, one could only assume that

Davis was using the oh-so-clever literary device of creating a character to
say all the things too offensive for the
author to say directly, yet including
the author as a kind of pathetic sidekick.
And offensive he was. Aside from
personally insulting me and my family, he managed to attack vegans,
everyone who doesn't exercise at 7:30
a.m., Al Bloom, Phi Psi and every
queer or queer-friendly member of
this campus. I think that covers just
about everyone
at Swarthmore. In
fact, the lifestyle endorsed seemed to
consist of working out, tossing a football, verbally and physically attacking anyone you disagree with, playing
video games and hanging out at a frat.
That sounds like Swat to me! I'd like
to think that the column was some
kind of poorly written satire, but
since "Shockey" is neither ridiculed
...

or even really rebuked by the author,
one can only assume he is tacitly
agreed with.
However, I don't want to dwell on
the author's views or talents; there
will always be someone to spew idiotic vitriol. One simply assumes that
writing such as this will not be printed in a newspaper. Indeed, I don't ultimately blame Davis for writing the

piece; I blame the editors of The
Phoenix for printing it. Let me be perfectly clear: This is not a freedom of
speech issue. This is the job of an editor. Editors are directly responsible
for the tenor of their publication and
the quality of its contents. When one
receives a submission wildly off topic
and in exceedingly poor taste, it is not
censorship to reject it; it is good editing. Otherwise you reduce yourself to
layout and proofreading.

NASA: Short on cash,
but shorter on dreams
Space exploration is one of those unfortunate issues that
people only seem to notice if it produces a great triumph or a
horrible tragedy. The tragedy of
the space shuttle Columbia last
February rightly generated sub
stantial media attention in the
form of grief for the astronauts
and questions as to whether
their deaths could have been
prevented.
After a while, though, public
attention shifted to the war in
Iraq and the floundering economy, and NASA faded from the
public consciousness. Which is
too bad, really, because the pub
lie ought to be considering why
our country is spending money
PATRICK HART
in space and what our intentions
there really are.
Drawing
I The space program, which
started with great fanfare in the
late 1950s as a part of our drive to
defeat the Soviet Union in the Cold War, achieved great triumphs
in its early years, culminating in the Apollo program. After
Apollo ended, though, the program seemed to lose its way.
Many in the space community wanted to launch an ambitious
program involving lunar bases, giant space stations and manned
missions to Mars, but such grand ambitions gave way to bruta
political reality, and, with the exception of George Bush Sr.'s ill
fated Space Exploration Initiative, there have been no real
attempts by the government to give us visionary, long-term space
goals.
On Sept. 7, The New York Times reported that NASA had
developed a plan for making the shuttle safer and getting it fly
ing again by the spring of 2004. While we should all hope that any
future shuttle flights are safe, a return to space for the shuttle
should not obscure the greater questions that NASA leaders anc
politicians must face.
The shuttle was originally developed as a cheap reusable
space vehicle that would lower the cost of spaceflight anc
increase access to space. Despite the shuttle's many successes, i
has not come close to fulfilling its original purpose. Space
activists have pushed for a true space plane for years, but mos
NASA spaceplane projects have fallen victim to budget cuts.
Indeed, as Congress examines NASA's conduct before the
Columbia accident, it should take a look at its own activities. I
is appropriate to examine NASA's shuttle program closely, anc
no criticism of the politicians should be understood as letting
NASA off the hook.
Still, it's undeniable that space exploration is not the nation
al priority it once was; since the glory days of the 19605, NASA
funding as a percentage of the federal budget has drastically
declined. After the Columbia disaster, President Bush and othe
national leaders promised the country that the space program
was important and would continue, but when it comes time to
crunch numbers, space has generally lost out.
It is not particularly fashionable to worry about space fund
ing right now; we have a huge federal budget deficit, millions o
Americans without health care and a war on terrorism to fight
Yet space is important. Aside from the scientific and commercia
benefits to be gained by exploring the moon, Mars, and beyond
there is a more fundamental reason why we should reinvigorate
our space program: It is the next step.
Since emerging as the dominant species on this planet
humans have expanded their population and grown technologi
cally. Today, the luckier humans have a standard of living and
comfort unequaled by any culture in history.
Yet in achieving this standard, we have put an enormou
strain on our planet's resources, a strain that will only grow
worse as the human population continues to expand. Space mus
be a part of the solution to this problem; our species has spread
itself across the Earth, and it seems only logical that we mus
now expand outwards if we are to survive.
We will get nowhere in space, though, if we do not have a
clear, bold vision of our future there. After the Columbia
tragedy, Texas Representative Nick Lampson told the Houston
Chronicle, "We used to have goals to have a base on the moon
our own space station and putting a man on Mars. None of those
are' goals of NASA anymore." If our space program is to get any

where, such bold dreams must be goals of NASA

RIAA gets tough on Americans
Other countries begin to weaken copyright law
Last week, the Recording Industry Association of
America began its bid to push its legal arm beyond a
handful of us malfeasant college ne'er-do-wells and
into the Real World.
The intention is to
send "a strong mes-

sage" to the legions of
Internet highwaymen

that their actions were
"not anonymous." The
first wave of lawsuits

included the now-infamous charges against a
12-year-old girl in a
housing
a 71year-old whose grandNew

York

children had downloaded some songs onto
his computer. Lest the
RIAA be seen as cruel
or vindictive (heavens
forfend!), it offered an

same time: it set up its "Clean Slate" program, whereby ex-pirates could declare that they had deleted all

their stolen music and promise never to steal again,
in return for a promise that they would not be sued
(unless they were already under investigation, in
which case they had just confessed). The program is
more than a bit disingenuous, though; the RIAA doesn't own the copyrights to any music, so they can't
promise that a record company won't sue you
and
there's no reason at all that their list of confessed
music thieves can't be subpoenaed.
One is given to wonder what all the fuss is about,
since the RIAA has already lost its battle against the
Internet. You would think they might have learned last
time, but that might be asking too much of the record
industry. When Napster lost its legal battle a few years
ago, many people pronounced music file sharing dead,
and the RIAA claimed victory. But the key vulnerability of Napster was that it used centralized servers to catalog the songs available on the network meaning that
the company itself could be considered in violation of
copyright law as an active participant. KaZaA and
Lime Wire circumvented this problem by foisting the
responsibility of cataloging onto users' computers
so

to

letter

now the RIAA is left suing 12-year-olds instead of big
companies with silly names.
So now the technology is shifting again. There are
minor changes already
programs, for example,
which block a known list of RIAA snoopers from finding your computer on KaZaA or LimeWire. More
importantly, a new generation of file-sharing networks
is in development that are not only "decentralized," like
KaZaA and LimeWire, but also encrypted. These range
from venerable (by computing standards) networks like
Freenet to unfinished newcomers like Blocks and
Filetopia. Like the current networks, they do not use
centralized servers. Unlike those, however, these programs hide your identity. When file sharing moves onto
these new services, the process will indeed be anonymous. The RIAA will need another way to catch the
music pirates.
The most perplexing thing about the issue, though,
is that swapping music files is legal 20 miles fromwhere
go to Canada, and you can
I live. Yep, that's right
download all the music you want. Five years ago (about
a year before Napster), the recording industry convinced Canada to deal with the problem of people making illegal copies of music on tapes and Minidiscs.
Parliament passed a law that legalized "private copythat is, it allows you to borrow someone's CD
ing"
and burn a copy of it or copy a music file from someone
else's computer to yours, so long as you don't sell or
give away the copy. In return, the law imposed a surcharge on all blank tapes and CD-Rs sold in Canada,
which was used to compensate people who owned the
copyrights. The RIAA can't prosecute music thieves in
Montreal or Vancouver, because they're not doing anyeven if an American is downloading the
thing illegal
music. So suing American file-sharers won't shut off
access to free downloadable music. (Maybe this way
we'll hear more from great Canadian bands like Broken
Social Scene and the Cowboy Junkies?)
As if Canada weren't enough, the EU is currently
considering a new law that, like Canada's, would leave
file sharing for non-commercial purposes legal. The
Internet has shifted the public perception of intellectual property so far that some (such as David Bowie) have
suggested that copyright may not exist in 10 years.
In the meantime, good luck to the RIAA. I'm sure
there are more 12-year-olds to sue.

White IQ vs. akili

op-art

by

annie

ronan

Why is our conception of intelligence so narrow and superficial that it is measurable, unlike, for example, German "geist"
("spirit, intelligence") and French "esprit" ("mind, spirit")? The
German genius captures the Zeitgeist ("spirit of the times"). The
French genius personifies the cultural or scientific esprit de
corps. The North American genius qualifies for Mensa with a
98th percentile IQ (Intelligence Quotient) or SAT (Scholastic
Aptitude Test) score. Our intelli-

gence is quantitative, not qualitative. It is mechanical and utilitarian. Why?
The
French and
the

Germans and the rest of the
world understand that intelligence is more a function of
willpower than cognitive apti-

tude. "Esprit" and "geist" don't
separate intelligence from spirit because the French and the
Germans understand that
"intelligence" is mind and spirit in one. It is both knowledge
TARU TAYLOR
and ethics, science and conscience. It is Pascal's esprit de
geometrie and his esprit de
Gadfly
finesse: deduction and intuhead
and
heart.
ition,
Intelligence is about proactively navigating one's ego through
the world as an independent agent, not victim; as a man or
woman, not child or adolescent.
Intelligence is not about IQ and scholastic aptitude on the one
hand, "emotional intelligence" on the other, which anyway is an
oxymoron, for emotions befuddle the intellect. What Thomas
Edison said of genius, that it's "99 percent perspiration and one
percent inspiration," is true of intelligence in general. It is neither aptitude nor emotions. It is circumspection. It is volition.
For "intelligence," at bottom, is the will to discipline one's
otherwise wayward imagination. It is the ability to solve problems both theoretical and practical. It takes willpower to see a
difficult problem through to its solution. It takes imagination
to see problems where others are mystified by token solutions,
to see questions where others are bamboozled by fake
answers. Intelligence is mind and spirit engaged in the problem-solving quest that is life. It is much deeper and richer
than IQ and scholastic aptitude suggest.
But IQ and scholastic aptitude are not about problem-solving.
They are about eugenics. Phrenology, measurement of intelligence via skull shape and size, was too crude and ridiculous. So
Alfred Binet and Carl Brigham invented the IQ and the SAT,
respectively, which are much more sophisticated ways of measuring intelligence. Phrenology was the old school, IQ and the
SAT are the new school, of eugenics. These standardized tests
have been culturally biased in favor of the "white man's burden"
since their inception, part and parcel of the eugenics movement,
back in the first quarter of the 20th century. Herrnstein and
Murray's tome, "The Bell Curve" (1994), is simply an echo of the
old-school white supremacy. It renders explicit the eugenics
implicit in IQ and the SAT, which are pseudosciences like
phrenology, just subtler and more sophisticated. Indeed, any college or university that uses the SAT as a criterion for admission
is a eugenics society. "Meritocracy" is nonsense.
So here in North America why have we, as blacks, allowed
ETS (Educational Testing Service) and Stanford-Binet to arbitrate our worth and intelligence via SAT's and IQ's; to standardize upper class and upper-middle-class whites and substandardize us? Why don't we have a Black Testing Service to
administer scholastic tests (not standardized tests) about Negro,
rather than bourgeois Caucasian, culture? What are our
scholastic standards? What is black cultural literacy? Geist is
the German, esprit is the French, IQ is the white American conception of "intelligence." What is the Negro conception of "intelligence"? What is the universal conception of "intelligence"?
Perhaps "akili," Swahili for "mind, intellect, understanding, reason, sense, intelligence, consciousness, ability, cleverness, judgment, discretion, a trick, ruse, clever plan, happy

thought," can thrust us beyond the eugenics of IQ and scholastic aptitude, to our own Pan-African standard. Perhaps akili
can thrust us beyond Pan-European indoctrination, to PanAfrican education. IQs and SATs are about bourgeois standardization, white normalization and the "organization kid."

Akili should be about every educated (not miseducated) Negro

being a standard-bearer of Pan-Africa. Eurocentrism is about
maintaining white supremacy. Afrocentrism is about asserting black equity. Eurocentrists have their Rhodes scholars.
We shall have our Garvey scholars.

reminder of the manager's ill-timed pitching change. By game's
end, a dense pictorial narrative fills the empty space.
Like any obscure cultural tradition, the art of keeping score
has an oral legacy. Each team, in its program, prints its own
method for interested novices, but these are best ignored; they're
sloppy and hard for even the experienced to decipher. The best
way to learn how to keep score is from the person sitting next to
you at the game. Parents hang over their children's first score
cards when they're old enough to follow along meticulously
Friends do the same with each other if one missed out on learn
ing the tradition during his youth. Every fan has his personal
method of recording the game, the equivalent of a language's
dialects, and he or she is probably more than happy to preserve
its life.
Keeping score has a fairly simple premise and components
Every ballplayer's fielding position is assigned a number anc
outs are recorded by marking which fielders touched the ball to
make the play. Noting base hits is trickier, but my method is rel
atively simple: Every base reached on a hit is denoted with an X
in a corner of the corresponding box for that player's at-bat. (The
bases correspond to the corners in a counterclockwise motion.
Any more movement around the bases is logged by writing down
in the corners of the base-runner's box the number of the batting

order position for the hitter who moved the runner along. Easy
enough, particularly when you're staring at a scorecard as you
learn, but the intricacy and unpredictability of baseball compli
cate matters. These problems appear in many forms, such as the
double-switch, the unexpected 8-5-6-5-4 rundown or simply miss
ing a play while passing money to the hot dog vendor.
All these complexities make the art of keeping score a rite of
passage. Considering the required diligence, it is not an activity
meant for the impatient. The first attempt is always a trying one
and, with all the variations, you might want to bring an eraser

stadium pencils, assuming mastery, fail to include
them.
With all this, why keep score? The trial period does have its
eventual rewards, most notably a keener appreciation of the
game. Keeping score sharpens your awareness; it helps you fol
low the game's rhythms and the subtle managerial decisions. It
molds the scorekeeper into a more active fan, letting him confi
dently comment on the game rather than let it seep through his
senses. Then it lends itself to the perfect post-game analysis
whether it's the returning car ride home or an unexpectec
review three years later. The numbers transform into muscular
players, and the X's into balls darting through gaps and feet
rounding dirty bases. The scorecard is baseball in its perfectly
compact form and is its most engaging storyteller.

against Lebanon Valley. The Tide lost the game to their nationally ranked opponents 6-1

BY SONALI SHAHI
sshahil@swarthmore.edu
After a promising start to the season, the Garnet
Tide suffered a small setback in their plans, losing 6-1
to Lebanon Valley College on Sept. 13. Emily
Szydlowski 'O5 netted Swarthmore's only goal.
Members of the team, from first-years to returning
players, were visibly frustrated with the outcome of
the game long after the final whistle blew. Karen
Lorang 'O6 muttered amidst sighs that "we had huge
chunks of time when we were dominating, but in
those opportunities, didn't come through."

Swat played strongly against Lebanon Valley, but

seemed hesitant during the middle of the game. "We
need to be consistent and confident throughout the

entire game," coach Kelly Wilcox said.

Second-year hockey player Heidi Fieselmann 'O6
agreed that the team had played strongly but not for

extended periods of time. "We had spurts where we
were right in there. There were definitely amazing
spurts throughout the game where we were close to

scoring," Fieselmann said. "All of our strengths were
clicking at once."
The Garnet appeared as though they had the tools
to pull off the win. However, mental toughness may
have been a determining factor working against the
Tide. Charlotte MacAusland 'O5 noted that they had
gone into the game "with the hesitation with their

being ranked fourth in the country."
Returning teammate Chloe Lewis 'O6 agreed with
MacAusland's assessment. "That's one thing we're
going to work on in terms of mental preparation: stepping it up if we're scored upon," she said.
Most of the goals were scored relatively close to

of them."
Lewis

compared last year's performance to
Saturday's game. Unlike this year, "I felt like last year

we were counting the minutes until the game ended."

Fieselmann observed that, after losing six seniors

and gaining 11 first-years, this year's team is much
younger than it has been in years past. "It was a
tough game, but we're a really young team and
they're nationally ranked," she said.
Lebanon Valley has consistently been one of the
top teams in the nation and is currently ranked

fourth by the coaches' preseason poll in the NCAA
Division 111 rankings. Still, Swat has never let them
win easily. "In the last three years, we have repeatedly played our best games against them, and they
narrowly escaped with a victory each time," coach
Wilcox said.

Although the Garnet has lost to Lebanon Valley in
the past, this seemed to be the year that the Tide
might finally turn history around. "I felt we were
ready this year to take that next step. I really did
expect it to fall into place this year," Wilcox said.
Coach Wilcox feels her team has more potential
than it gives itself credit for. "We are a young team,
but that is no excuse, really. We realize how good we
are at times, but don't always fully believe it," she
said. "I am confident that in time the players will
believe in themselves as much as I do."
Fieselmann furthered that the team came away
from this loss with a greater sense of what to work on,
so that they will be "ready and pumped for the next
game." The Garnet will next compete in the Seven
Sisters Tournament at Wellesley College this weekend.

The struggles continued for the men's
soccer team this past week, as the Garnet
again failed to score against Moravian and
St. Mary's, losing 2-0 and 4-0, respectively.

With the losses, Swarthmore tumbled to 15 on the year as they prepared to take on

Despite their continued inability to

won't be able to attack us, and we can keep
the pressure on them."
Against an undefeated St. Mary's
squad this past Saturday, the Tide were
overwhelmed in the first half as the
Seahawks put up all four of their goals in
the first 30 minutes of the game. However,
Swarthmore was able to control the second half of the game, out shooting St.
Mary's 10-8, and while they didn't score,
showed considerable improvement from
their first half performance. "We came
out a little flat in the first half, and I guess
we were surprised at the intensity they
showed, and that lead to some sloppy
play," mid fielder Matt Schiller 'O7 said.
"Fortunately we were able to regroup in
the second half and play some solid soccer,
putting the pressure back on them, creating some good chances, which was something we didn't do well in the first half."
Swarthmore's young talent showcased
itself during the second half against the
Seahawks, as midfielders Alex Elkins 'O6
and Schiller, forward Brandon Penix 'O7
and goalkeeper Stephen St. Vincent 'O7 all
played well. "We got a great game out of

day," Wagner said. "It was very encouraging."
The Garnet also fell 2-0 to a hard-nosed
Moravian squad last Wednesday at

Clothier Stadium, as Swarthmore fell
behind at the midpoint of the first half and
couldn't quite catch up to the physical and
quick Greyhounds, incurring several key
penalties in their attempt to push the ball
upfield during the second half. "The
biggest problem we had was that we lost
our composure," goalkeeper Nate Shupe

'O5 said. "We had intensity, but it was hard
work with no direction. To win we had to
keep the ball on the floor and we didn't. To
credit their goalkeeper, he did a good job,
but we had our opportunities and just didn't convert like we needed to."
Swarthmore begins its conference
schedule this Saturday at Clothier
Stadium against the Dickinson Red Devils
at 2 p.m. The Garnet Tide will also travel to
the University of Scranton this Tuesday to
take on the Royals.

Volleyball win streak ends at Richard Stockton
After opening the season with a fourgame winning streak, the women's volleyball team ran into stiff competition last

weekend at the Richard Stockton
Tournament Even though the Tide lost
matches to Richard Stockton, Catholic
and Haverford, the team is confident they
are playing the best volleyball of the season.
Two Swarthmore players, sophomore
setter Emily Conlon and senior opposite
Sarah Donovan were named to the alltournament team.
"Even though we lost all three games to
Haverford, we played the best we have yet
and we showed perserverance against
three very tough teams," Erica George 'O7

said.
George cited the team's serves this
weekendas an example of their continuing
improvement. "Our serves forced many of
the other teams to make passing errors,
creating many points for us," George said.
Head coach Harleigh Leigh agreed, citing instead the team's improved defense.
"We saw great improvements in our defensive efforts, led by the sophomore back row
duo of Tanya Gonzales and Patrice Berry,"
Leigh said.
Despite these improvements, Leigh
expects much more from her players. "My
expectations, in regards to the end results,
were higher than what we achieved. I
wanted us to be able to be aggressive and
take control right from the start. I also
wanted the team to improve upon our consistency, which they did in many aspects,
particularly in our back row defense and
serving," she said.
For these reasons and more, the threegame skid does not have the Tide worried
about their future. One reason for this confidence is the leadership of their head
coach. "Coach [Leigh] pushes us so hard

and this helps us to get past our weaknesses so that we are able to play our best each
time we step onto the court," Morrison
said.
They are hoping that the hard work and
stiff competition translates into a successful
weekend
the
Swarthmore
at
Invitational. "I think that this weekend we
have a great chance at winning the Garnet
Classic," Katrina Morrison 'O4 said. "We
haven't lost a match at home yet and we
don't plan to this weekend. It is going to be
great to have the support of our fans, faculty, and family this weekend but no matter
what we are going to keep our goals in
mind and stay focused throughout the

day."
If the Tide are to succeed, they will need
to gain consistency from their senior and
first-year outside hitter duo of Erica

'O7 and Emma Benn 'O4. Both have
shown flashes of brilliance throughout the
season. "First-year Erica George is going
to be a constant force as an outside hitter
for us this fall with her smart attacking
style of putting the ball away and use
blockers. She compliments senior co-captain Emma Benn, our other outside hitter,
as they are both aggressive and work to be
consistent attackers on the outside."
The Garnet responded with a 3-0
shutout against Arcadia on Wednesday
evening to even theirrecord to 5-5.
The Tide are hosting the first annual
Garnet Classic this weekend. "My goals for
this weekend are similar to those of last
week be aggressive and take control from
the start, working to be the ones to dictate
the tempo of the games and matches,"
coach Leigh said. "I think we have an

brain, so I'll take a stab with my heart.
I'd love to see the Phillies take it, thus
returning playoff baseball to the Vet
before it collapses off into the sunset. I'd
also enjoy seeing the Dodgers make the
post-season; their combination of the
best pitching staff in baseball with an

offense deader than Vaudeville makes
them perhaps the most interesting team
still alive.

So is it Yanks, Red Sox, Twins, A's,
Braves, Giants, Cubs, and Dodgers?
Maybe, but honestly I'dbe surprised. All
I've really done here is show which
teams have the easiest path to the play-

offs. Who's to say that the beneficiaries

of kind scheduling won't become complacent, taking a few too many games off
against the Tigers or Reds? And it
wouldn't surprise me in the least if a
team with a tough schedule against division opponents took advantage of their
opportunities to gain whole games with
victories.
Is it possible to say with any certainty who will go to the playoffs in baseball
this year? Probably not. So what, then,
was the point of this column? Probably
just to show how much fun it's going to
be to watch.

October musings
The NFL was better this weekend. The Ravens won, geta record-setting 295 rushing yards from Jamal Lewis,
after he had told a friend on the Cleveland Browns he would
indeed break said record in that game. It's this sort of thing
which reminds me why I picked the Ravens to win it all. They
have their punishing defense back and now, thanks to Jamal
Lewis, they have their swagger back. My Ravens are now tied
for first in the AFC North and well on their way to playing
Carlton's Redskins in the Super Bowl.
But the Super Bowl is far away, and the Ravens can still
break my heart. The World Series, however, is relatively
near, and, even though my
Orioles aren't contenders, my
lust for pennant races and
post-season baseball burns
ever passionately. This year's
pennant races are shaping up
to be the best of my lifetime.
As I write this, 16 of the 30
major league teams are still
vying for the eight playoff
spots, with only 13 days to go
in the season. Utterly ridiculous. Only two of the teams,
Atlanta and San Francisco,
can say with complete confidence that they will make the
BEN WHARTON
ting

playoffs.

90% Half Mental

So who's in and who's not?

Well, it's pretty damn hard to
say. All of the teams have relatively glaring weaknesses.
Whether it's a combustible bullpen, crapshoot starting pitching, just plain meager offense, or corpses manning key positions, each team has its moments of winging and praying. Not
even the Braves (bullpen) or Giants (every hitter except
Barry Bonds) are immune.
I see the season coming down to scheduling and managing.
In the AL East, the Yankees and the Red Sox are both beneficiaries of kind scheduling, as the Sox have no more series
against contenders and the Yanks have only one, against the
White Sox. Meanwhile, in the West, the Mariners and
Athletics have virtually identical schedules, with two series
against each other and one each against the Angels and
Rangers. With the Mariners and Athletics beating up against
each other, the Red Sox should win the wild card. The Yanks
once again sicken me with their perennial AL East Division
crown. Of the A's and M's, my money would be on the A's, as
they currently hold a four-game lead. In the Central, the
White Sox have the roughest situation: They play all four of
their series against contenders, including seven games
against the Kansas City Royals. The Twins play only one
series against contenders, and they are also the fortunate beneficiaries of seven games against the miserable Detroit
Tigers, who are pretty much twice as bad as the next worst
team. The Royals are stuck in the middle with those seven
games against the Sox, but no other games against contenders.
In the NL, the Central crown and the wild card are still up
for grabs. In the Central, I'm calling the Cubs to take it, since
they have no more games against contending teams. The
Astros and Cardinals both have six games against contenders,
including three against each other. The Astros are coming off
a sweep of the Cardinals this weekend, where the Cards
seemed to lose their cool complaining about the umpiring.
None of the wild card contenders have less than six remaining games against contenders, so the scheduling is less a factor here than elsewhere. It looks too cluttered to call with my

Women's tennis team aces Swat Invite
BY ALEX KALKSTEIN
akalkstl@swarthmore.edu
Women's tennis served an ace this weekend at the
Swat Invitational, placing five individuals in the singles finals and five teams in the doubles finals. The success this weekend boosted the Tide's soaring spirits and
optimism for the upcoming season.
All of the top players are returning for the reigning
Centennial Conference champions, and players have
noticed significant improvement from last year's championship team. "Those returning from last year have
already made huge improvements," Anjani Reddy 'O4
said.
Despite the strength of last year's squad, the firstyears are also expected to make an instant impact this
season. The first-year quintet is composed of Marissa
Matthews, Waverly Lutx, Sonya Reynolds and Sara
Sargent. "With the addition of five solid freshmen, our
prospects look very good," Jenna Adelberg 'O6 said.
Last weekend, the Garnet dominated flight one play
as Reddy and Reynolds plowed through their rivals to
meet in the final. Experience proved to be the differ-

ence, as Reddy, a two-time Centennial Conference singles champion, defeated Reynolds in practice on
Tuesday. Despite the loss, Reynolds was satisfied with
her performance. "I played a lot more level headed,"
Reynolds said. "I didn't let things get to me, ignored
mental lapses and kept conflicts to a minimum."
Reynolds also teamed up with Reddy on Sunday to
claim an 8-1 victory over Delaware's Liz Perlow and
Sari Shuster in the flight one doubles championship.
Caroline Celano 'O4 dominated flight two singles

play, defeating Delaware's Beth Principe 6-0, 6-4 in the
flight two championship match. Celano and Sonia
Vallabh 'O6 faced teammates Waverly Lutz 'O7 and
Kristina Pao 'O4 to claim bragging rights for the flight
two doubles final on Wednesday.
Emily Townsend 'O6 and Vallabh faced off
Wednesday for the flight three singles championships.
Matthews and Sargent overcame Millersville's Morgan
Burdette and Christi Lilly 8-6 for the flight three doubles final.
Adelberg

and

Townsend

defeated

Delaware's

Stefanie Riddle and Katie Rose 8-6 to claim the flight

four doubles title." We played really well this weekend,
and, although it was an individual tournament, all of
our hard work as a team paid off," Adelberg said.
One of the reasons for the Tide's early success is
returning second-year head coach Jeremy Loomis.
Coach Loomis, a former college tennis and pro tour
player, brings both tennis skill and significant experience as a coach. Before joining Swat tennis last fall, he
worked as an assistant coach at Duke and University of
Maryland, helping Duke to a 25-5 record. This convergence of skill as a coach and as a tennis player will help
the Garnet continue to play at the level witnessed this
weekend. "Jeremy Loomis has maximized the potential
of the team," Reynolds said. "He helped us to defeat
solid opponents."
Reynolds also credits Coach Loomis as one of the
main reasons she decided to come to Swarthmore and
play tennis.
The Garnet next hits the court on Sept. 27 to compete
at Mary Washington
for the ITA Regional
Championship.
