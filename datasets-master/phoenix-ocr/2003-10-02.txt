Only SQU's portion of the board was
torn down, while the remainder of the
board, which shows the names and logos of
HOLA (now Enlace), Swarthmore Asian
Organization and the Native American
Students Association, remained untouched.
"We were all clearly not only outraged
but disappointed that something like this
could occur within our community,"
Associate Dean of Multicultural Affairs
Darryl Smaw said.
SQU believes the vandalism occurred
sometime between 2:30 and 5:30 a.m. on
Sunday. No one knows who the culprit is,
and there is little hope that one will be

found.

"There's virtually nothing to follow up
on," Director of Public Safety Owen
Redgrave said.
In an e-mail to the senior administrators,' Student Council, SQU and The

On Monday, Vice President for College

Eldridge '6l sent a reserved-students e-mail
in response to the incident. "We strongly
condemn these acts and call upon the
entire community to reassert the primacy
of respect and civility as core values here
at Swarthmore," Eldridge wrote.
However, Eldridge told The Phoenix that,
while it is important for the administration
to respond, it cannot do so in isolation, and
the student body needs to take part.
"Here, we want to treat people as adults
and hope that they can govern themselves,
and hope that through peer relationships
that these things get dealt with and maybe
even uncovered," he said. "I do think students have a right to assert the community's values."
Smaw and Assistant Dean and IC
Director Rafael Zapata also met with
ADVICE, SQU and Student Council on
Monday to discuss how they would
respond. There was talk of a campus-wide
discussion sometime this week, but nothing definite was scheduled as of press time.

Kishor, who was at the meeting, told The

Two weeks ago, amid discussions of campus construction,
the endowment and intellectual
property, the board convened
and debated the idea of a living
wage at Swarthmore. The board
asked the student and faculty

co-chairs of the Ad Hoc

Board discussion regarding the
living wage."

"It is an issue of extreme relevance and importance to the cam-

contrary to the mission and purpose of our institution if such a
discussion was not transparent,"
the statement said.

The committee has been held
back recently, Schwartz said,
because six out of eight student
and faculty members left last year.
“There has to be a little bit ofbacktracking if you have so many new

“I just don’t think we can have

He pointed out that it had taken
the committee three months of
weekly meetings to come up with a
living wage for Swarthmore. “The
issues are unbelievably complicated,” he said. “Even with everyone
wanting to come up with a proposal for a living wage, it would be
irresponsible to ignore the complexity of the matter.”
The committee’s original goal,
Bradbury said, was to have a recommendation

by
December of 2002, a deadline the
committee has since delayed
twice. “There was concern on the
part of the Living Wage and

Schwartz said distributing
these materials without the committee's approval had been an
"executive decision" made by
himself and Young. The co-chairs
mailed the documents before the
committee had held its first meeting of the semester.
"The only reason that we didn't give them to the committee
was an oversight," Schwartz said.
Two of the documents were
"arguments against a living
wage," Bradbury said. The committee's charter had told members to work under the assumption that increasing the minimum wage rate would be "prudent and right," and the president had directed the committee
to focus on how to implement a
living wage, not whether to

Anticipating tradeoffs
The recommendation to the
president's office will comprise
not just a proposed minimum
wage for the college but also a
benefit plan and suggestions for
how to avoid negative tradeoffs of
a higher wage, Bradbury said.
"Because we know that we will
have a tough sell, we want to
anticipate every possible concern
and objection and to have something to say about'it," Schwartz
said.

Gradual automation is one
predicted outcome the committee
is trying to tackle. "If it costs

The committee is considering

that,

committee "with the understanding that, once the committee had
come forth with its recommendation, there would be full community discussion of the recommendation, with particular attention
to its content, the extent to which
the college should direct its funds
from support of its core educational program to this kind of valued community and societal end,
and the question of financing,
where should the funds come
from
at the cost of what other

academic and community priorities."
According to Schwartz, the
college budget sets aside $400,000

in the category of "new program"
each year. That $400,000 caps how
much the board can spend on any
new undertaking that would
require a continuing expense.
"There's no doubt that any recommendation we end up making
would use up all of that," he said.
"This is a budget buster."
Schwartz said he thought the
regular budgeting process might
not have anything to do with
funding a living wage should the

college decide to have one. The
enormous cost, he said, would
require a special fund from outside the college's budget.
"If the money is found from

she said.
President Bloom disagreed
about the probability of funding
from outside the college budget.
"I think it's safe to say the

Scholarship program
overhaul complete
BY ELIZABETH BUCKNER

ebucknel@swarthmore.edu

After more than 20 years of helping Swarthmore students conduct
social change work, the Lang Opportunity Scholarship is revolution-

izing its approach to selecting Lang Scholars.

While the five to six scholars were previously selected during the
admissions process, this year's scholars will be selected through a rigorous application process in the beginning of their sophomore year.
Pat James, associate director for student programs at the Lang
Center, said that this change in the selection process represented the
first of its kind since the program was founded in 1985. The Lang
Center and college administrators spent more than two years determining the most effective application process.
"We've had to do a lot of soul-searching to enact this change,"

"There were many Lang scholars who
received the scholarship before
they knew how to do Swat. This
scholarship demands extensive time,
energy and skills from students."
Pat James, Lang Center director
Benjamin Kabak Phoenix Staff

James said. "We faced a lot of trepidation in taking this out of the
realm of admissions, but, then again, we had compelling reasons for

change."

One of the primary reasons for change was the desire to ensure that
selected Lang scholars were prepared for the rigors of what the scholarship's demands. "There were many Lang scholars who received the
Lang scholarship before they knew how to do Swat. This scholarship
demands extensive time, energy and skills from students," James said.
The Lang Opportunity Scholarship encourages students to "design
and implement effective, innovative solutions to significant social
problems," according to its Web site. The scholarship covers the workstudy and loan portions of their financial aid awards and provides a
paid summer internship, educational enhancement funds of up to
$1,500 and supportive mentoring and guidance.
The Lang Scholarship also provides students with funds up to
$lO,OOO to carry out an Opportunity Project that addresses a specific
social problem.
The new application procedure is a two-part process, involving
both a written application and an interview. "This application process
will make students have a real conversation about the sacrifices
involved," James said.
Moreover, it will allow the members of the selection committee to
meet the applicant. "The students' ability to carry their project out to
fruition was harder to evaluate when all we saw was their college
application," James said. She also noted that many students changed
from their senior year in high school to the time they came to college.
James said that another exciting aspect of the application process
is that current Lang Scholars would take part in the selection process,
allowing "people who are actually living the experience" to decide the
future of the program.
Even with the extensive application process, there has been substantial student interest.
The class of 2006, which is the first class to be affected by the
changes in the application process, has been responsive and optimistic
about the changes to the Lang Scholarship.
"I think that, previously, the admissions department used the Lang
as an incentive to come to Swarthmore, but now the students apply
specifically to work within the parameters of the project to enact
social change," said Jayanti Owens 'O6, a prospective Lang Scholar.
Fellow applicant Caitlin Butler 'O6 recognizes the value of the new
process for applying. "These changes really make a lot of sense. The
fact that they are waiting till after students are here at Swat allows
students to find areas of social work they never knew about before,"
she said.
Both Butler and Owens said that they appreciated the extensive
application process despite its rigor.
"The application process has a dual purpose for students. It makes
sure students are ready and willing for the work the Lang entails and
also, just in the process of working through the vision statement, it
helps us focus and refine our ideas," Butler said.
Owens agreed, saying that it would, "weed out applicants who are
not serious." She said that such an application process is necessary
because of the large amount of money that the Lang offers for service
projects.

SCDC Co-founder Luke Smith wants students to use the Linux operating system instead of Windows.

New group to fight RIAA, Microsoft
BY CHRISTINA TEMES
ctemesl@swarthmore.edu

In an effort to gain campus-wide exposure and
to inform students of threats to computing free-

dom, the new student-run group Swarthmore
Coalitionfor the Digital Commons held a rally and
information session on Tuesday night in the science center.
The group, founded by Nelson Pavlovsky 'O6
and Luke Smith 'O6, is dedicated to a multitude of
issues pertaining to the prevention of the limiting
of open culture. This translates into resisting the
efforts of the Recording Industry Association of
America to sue those who share music files, opposing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and similar expansion of intellectual property law, spreading the use of Linux and other freeware programs
and fighting the plan of Microsoft and the
"Trusted Computing Platform Alliance" to put
monitoring chips in personal computers.
Linux, a free alternative to the Microsoft
Windows operating system, lies at the heart of
SCDC's philosophy. The group's short-term goals
include getting more students to switch to Linux
and get some Linux-based computers in public
areas, to "show everyone how functional Linux is
that it's not some impractical pipedream,"

Pavlovsky said.
A major factor in SCDC's championing of
the advent of the Microsoft's new
"Trusted Computing" technology, also known as

Linux is

the Palladium chip. This technology, already present in some new IBM ThinkPads and set to be
released in the upcoming version of Windows,
would require Microsoft to verify if a user has permission to open a file on his or her computer.
Theoretically, this gives Microsoft the power to
deny one access to a file or program that is saved
on one's own computer. Pavlovsky said that a
massive switch to Linux could possibly cause
Microsoft to step down its efforts to expand this
technology. This is why SCDC wishes to recruit
more colleges to boycott 'Trusted Computing' tech-

nology."

One of the other major issues to which the
SCDC is committed is resisting current copyright
and intellectual property laws, such as the DMCA.
"The current trend in intellectual property [law] is

October 2, 2003

toward the absurd," Smith said. He added that this

"is not encouraging innovation, but inhibiting it."
Under current law, one cannot reproduce a
DVD or tell someone how to reproduce a DVD,
even if one owns the data and is using it for personal use. The RIAA continues to crack down
more harshly on those who share music files over
the Internet.
SCDC organizers wish to demonstrate the benefits of free, open sharing of such files without
advocating piracy and while promoting alterna-

tives to current copyrights, such as those available through creativecommons.org, in which
artists choose how their work can be used, shared,
or altered in the future.
SCDC members attempted to address all of
these issues at Tuesday night's meeting. The night
an explanation of the group by Smith
and Pavlovsky, which was followed by questions

began with

by the audience.
A viewing of "Free Culture," a recorded presentation given by Lawrence Lessig, a proponent of
open culture and author of "The Future of Ideas,"
followed. In it, Lessig described the beginning of
free culture in 1774 and the progression of laws to
limit it, saying that "never in our history have
fewer people controlled the evolution of our culture." The event ended with the distribution of
free software and the opportunity for students to
get Linux installed on their computers.
Upwards of 20 students attended the event,
many of whom were informed of the event by
SCDC's chalking of the campus that took place on
Sunday. The audience seemed to respond positive-

ly to the meeting.
"It's good to think about [these issues], because
people don't often think about things like intellectual property law until they start to directly
impact them," Tara Levin 'O7 said.
After the night's success, the SCDC organizers
began to look to the future with optimism. This
semester they hope to continue proposing alternatives in software, to get a speaker to come to campus and to organize a faculty panel for the spring
semester.
After that, the SCDC plans to continue to work
hard for their goals. "If there's one place to bridge
the gap between technology and creativity, it's
Swarthmore," Smith said.

Due to the difficulties in carrying out the largescale event last year, a new committee has been cre-

ated to organize the event.
Student Activities Coordinator Jenny Yim and
Student Budget Committee Treasurer Jeff
Traczynski 'O4 will serve as co-chairs, and five students selected by Student Council as well as a representee from Student Council will serve on the committee.
The committee

will also spearhead Worthstock,
an all-day concert series that was formerly run by
WSRN FM 915.

Syllabi online

Student Council is looking into the possibility of
creating a Web site where all course syllabi could be
found. So far, professors have expressed concern
that the syllabi not be accessible to the general public and that they be able to update the syllabi as
changes are made to them.

Students came to The Ring last Thursday night to discuss the effectiveness of first-year diversity workshops.

The Ring discusses diversity workshops
BY PAUL GOLDSMITH-PINKHAM
pgoldsml@swarthmore.edu

The first meeting of the all-campus

discussion group known as The Ring
was held last Thursday, kicking off
the year with a forum on the firstyear orientation diversity work-

shops.

Several people questioned the
necessity of having the diversity
workshops at all. Many participants
had been facilitators of the first-year
workshops and said that the discus-

sions among the facilitators themselves were in fact more fulfilling
than the discussions among the firstyears.
One of the biggest issues seemed to
be finding a balance between voluntary discussions for the first-years
and creating an obligatory workshop.

Some of the solutions offered were to
have the workshops farther into the
school year. But moderator Nicola
Wells 'O5 raised the question, "How do
you get people to care?"

The

majority

of the 25 students at

The Ring were upperclassmen who had
already facilitated a workshop. Only
four first-year attended the discussion.
The meeting consisted of a controlled discussion group moderated
by Wells and panelists Powen Shiah
'O6, Aparna Kishor 'O5 and Mustafa
Paksoy 'O7. Shiah was co-director of
the first-year workshops this year,
along with
Associate Dean of
Multicultural Affairs Darryl Smaw,
while Kishor was a workshop facilita-

tor. Paksoy attended the workshops
during orientation week.

Student Activities reinforces
fine for private party advertising
BY CATHERINE CLARK
cclark2@swarthmore.edu

While advertising for fund-raiser-style parties has
always been prohibited and punished on campus, this
year the administration will crack down on illegal advertising.
A $5O dollar fine will be levied against all groups who
advertise non-SAC funded parties or include promises of
alcohol in any party advertisement.
A similar rule has always existed in the student hand-

book. But this year Director of Student Activities Jenny
Yim said the administration aims to create more awareness of its existence among the student body and punish
its infringement "more proactively."
While Yim focused specifically on the posting of flyers
around campus, groups also cannot send out written
invitations to more than one-third of the campus for a
private party.
Accordingly, she has sent out a reserved-students email reminding the student body not to advertise for private parties. Yim aims not to let ignorance be an excuse
for students groups faced with fines.
A private party is defined as a party that demands a

6

cover charge. By the student handbook's definition,
these parties must be by invitation only. Cover charges
are considered to go against Swarthmore's commitment

to create a social environment equally accessible to all

Swarthmore Police Report
Officer Stilwell was on routine patrol on Sept. 24 at
11:15 p.m. in the area of Park and Yale Avenues when
he observed a vehicle swerving across the center line
of the highway on Yale Avenue. The officer followed
the vehicle and observed other violations. The operator was stopped on Swarthmore Avenue at Waverly
Terrace. Upon approaching the driver, an odor of alcoholic beverage was detected. The driver failed several
field sobriety tests and was arrested for driving under
the influence.

students.

While other organizations have received fines in past
years, Phi Psi was the first group this year to be fined for
advertising a party it held the first weekend of school.
But other groups have cleverly found ways around the
advertising prohibition to still hold successful fundraising parties.

The men's and women's swim team advertised for
their recent fund-raiser for their winter break training
trip to St. Croix by wearing t-shirts with slogans such as
"Come early, get lei'd!" and "The swim team doesn't
believe in being dry."
While swim team captain Krista Gigone 'O4 describes
these rules as "a pain," she said she did not think that "it
would be fair to grant groups doing fund raising the
same degree of advertising freedom as groups doing the
work to throw a free party."
Fair or not fair, public advertising for private parties
or advertisements promising the availability of alcohol
at any part will not be accepted on campus this year.

Econ lecture favors

BY GARTH

SHELDON-COULSON

gsheldol@swarthmore.edu
Jeffrey Miron '79, one of the nation's
foremost libertarian thinkers, brought economic analysis to focus on the issue of drug
legalization last Thursday as he launched
the department of economics' annual lecture series.
In the hour-long talk, mandatory for

Economics 1 students, Miron argued that
drug prohibition's large costs to society are
not outweighed by the dubious advantages
conferred by lowered drug consumption.
Miron, a professor of economics at Boston
University, said he hoped that even if some
audience members did not agree with his

Lott argues for relaxed gun laws
BY ELIZABETH COLLINS

ecollin2@swarthmore.edu

Dr. John Lott argued that lenient gun
permit laws would cause a decrease in violent crimes during Monday's lecture,
"Guns: Crime and Deterrence."
"Guns make it easier for bad things to
happen," Lott said in his introduction.
"But guns also make it easier for people to
prevent bad things from happening." The
important thing, Lott said, is to find the net

effect.

Lott, the author of "More Guns, Less
Crime" and "The Bias Against Guns," said
that the media, the government and polling
organizations provide the public with
biased information that is in favor of gun
control.
He cited that, in 2001, The New York
Times used SLOOO words to cover gun
crimes but only 163 words to cover stories
in which guns were used defensively.
Lott, an economist from the American
Enterprise Institue, said that guns protected the most vulnerable groups of

Americans, particularly the elderly and
women. He said that women who behaved
passively when attacked were 2.5 times
more likely to be injured than women who
responded with a gun.
The lecture left the audience unsatisfied.
"I thought his argument was solid in a

statistical and economic sense," Rebecca
Brubaker 'O6 said. "But it could have been
strengthened if he could have pulled in
outside evidence," such as cultural differences between the U.S. and Japan, where
there are fewer guns and a lower crime
rate.

Others thought Lott's data from observational studies could not possibly establish a causal link between right-to-carry
laws and decreased violence.

"He didn't prove with hardcore data

that there was a direct
causal relationship between the introduction of shall issue laws and crime deterrence," Lola Irele 'O5 said.
The lecture was sponsored by the mathematics and statistics department.
statistically

conclusions, they would attempt to appreciate the economic arguments he present-

Miron began the lecture by addressing a
typical defense of prohibition
including
its purportedly beneficial effects on crime,
health and societal wellbeing
which he
then proceeded to rebut by demonstrating
that prohibition causes more harm than
drugs themselves.
Prohibition costs the government over
$33 billion to enforce each year, which is
more than the federal budget for education,
according to Miron. "The policy does not
eliminate the demand or supply of drugs
but simply forces buyers and sellers to an
underground market," he said.
Miron went on to argue that underground or "black" markets act differently
from regular markets. In creating them,
the government deprives itself of valuable

tax revenues as well as an opportunity to
regulate the quality and potency of the
drugs being exchanged. Furthermore,
when disputes arise in black markets and
there are no legal systems to turn to, violent crime is often the only recourse, he
said.

While unwavering in his negative
assessment of prohibition's costs, Miron
allowed that "interdiction is modestly
effective" and that prohibition can curb
which, he said, is its
drug consumption

aspect.

He proceeded, however, to downplay the
negative aspects of drug consumption,
arguing instead that rational drug con-

sumption is no different from the rational
consumption of McDonald's fast food or
any other product. Addiction, he said, is a
foreseeable consequence of drug use, and
users would exercise restraint if they did
not wish to become addicted.

"The policy does not eliminate the demand or supply
of drugs but simply forces
buyers and sellers to an
underground market."
Jeffrey Miron 79
While it was difficult to find an economics student who disagreed with Miron's
economic arguments, a number of students

found his approach simplistic.
"He didn't say anything original," said
Carolyn Sha 'O4, an economics major. "I
know it was meant for intro students, but
he would gloss over some of his arguments
by saying, 'lt's obvious that...'"
Etan Cohen 'O7, an Economics 1 student,
said, "I didn't buy his conclusion. I think
we should be taught to care for one another as a society, not just do whatever's best
for ourselves as individuals. It was good to
see his arguments, but there's more to it
than economics."
Cohen expressed appreciation, however, for the relevance of the talk to current
affairs. "It was a current event that we
were able to see both sides of. That was
interesting," he said.

The next speaker to be presented by the
economics department will be F.M.
Scherer, who will discuss the Microsoft

antitrust case.

Amid blood shortage, college increases donation goal
BY RYAN CROKEN
rcrokenl@swarthmore.edu

Prompted by statistics revealing that Swarthmore has
been producing fewer donations per capita than schools of
similar size and type, the college's bi-annual blood drive
organizers have created a new campaign strategy and

increased their donation goal.
"The information was a wakeup call for us," Al Silva 'O4
said. Silva is overseeing Delta Upsilon's management of

the campaign.
DU had assumed complete control over the blood drive
in recent years, but this year its efforts will be bolstered by
those of the President's Committee, headed by Maurice
Eldridge '6l, vice president for college and community rela-

tions.
"We decided to use the President's Office to give
increased visibility to the cause," Eldridge said.
Julie Homan of the Penn Jersey Region of the
American Red Cross said that, at schools like Dartmouth
and Ursinus, whose average student donation rates are
20 percent and 16 percent respectively, blood drives have
had the support and concerted assistance of the administration.
At Swarthmore, "it's been a one-man show," and donation rates have hovered around a respectable but far from

said.

"DU has been doing a good job with the resources they
have, but we wanted to elevate the drive this year. We
wanted the president's support because that has been so

"Many people don't recognize just
how vital this demand is. If they realized they were saving lives, they

key at other schools,” Homan said.

The change in strategy comes at a time when local
blood supplies are dwindling to dangerously low levels.
Two weeks ago, Hurricane Isabel exacerbated an already
severe blood shortage in the Penn-Jersey region and left
over 100 hospitals in the area with only an eight-hour supply of blood, Bullard said.
The Red Cross considers a five-day supply to be its opti-

mal safe level.
"I mean to alarm and to urge you to visit the Web site
to schedule your opportunity to give here on campus on
Oct. 8," Eldridge said in a Sept. 24 e-mail to the faculty and
staff as a response to the critical shortage and to promote
the blood drive.
"Many people don't recognize just how vital this
demand is. If they realized they were saving lives, they
would donate," Eldridge said.
Eldridge and DU are working together to increase student awareness. Silva said he has been tabling in Sharpies,
drafting posters and flyers, and contacting campus group
leaders, urging them to inform and activate their members.
Eldridge said he and his committee have been reaching
out to various leaders on campus, including residential
assistants, in hopes that they will spread the word.
Swarthmore's goal for this blood drive is set at 55 faculty and 155 student donations, a goal that Eldridge
described as "ambitious" but doable.

The blood donations will take place on Wednesday,

Oct. 8, in Upper Tarble. Most healthy people over 110
pounds and 17 years of age are eligible to give blood.
As opposed to previous years, students should register
beforehand, either by e-mailing Silva or by scheduling an

appointment online at www.swarthmore.givesblood.org.

Students with medical needs and upperclassmen with jobs will get priority for a campus parking space

Student Council changes
parking space allotment
Student Council hopes to implement and codify a
new set ofcriteria for allotting parking spaces to students, faculty and staff in order to make the process
of receiving permits more fair and save spaces for
community members who need them most.
Student Council Co-president Anna Morgan 'O4
said the new criteria could be in place as soon as
next semester, but, at the latest, would take effect by
the end of this academic year. Problems have arisen
due to the lack of a written set ofrules set out by the
council to guide Parking Committee in making its
decisions.
"We want to make sure there's a clearly demarcated thing," she said. "And right now we think it's
best for Student Council to develop a criteria with
Public Safety so the same criteria can be implemented every year and can be implemented more
fairly."
Notable changes Morgan mentioned include prioritizing students with medical needs, as well seniors and juniors with jobs. Unofficially, Parking
Committee currently gives preference for these and
similar reasons. The difference, according to
Morgan, is in the council's effort to establish more

accountability.

Parking Committee has been through a process
of transition for the last two years, since Student
Council decided that, ever since all three groups
were affected by its decisions, students, faculty and
staff should compose the committee's members.
"Unfortunately, we couldn't really get any faculty to
participate, so we got staff and students [only],"
Morgan said.
Moreover, "There was a confused transition of
power. People on the old committee didn't realize
their term had ended, and new people on the committee didn't understand how their power was
working." As well, not everyone appointed was able

ROSS RECOMMENDS

Rufus Wainwright, Want One
I reckon that "Want" will be about the last time reviews of a
Rufus Wainwright album will be prefaced with a disclosure of
his parentage. The acclaim and accomplishments of his folkstar
family notwithstanding, Rufus is poised to eclipse them all
indeed, he may have already done it. His sophomore release,

an utterly unique melange of broad way-tinged
2001 's "Poses"
tunesmithing, jazz-inflected urbanity, dramatic orchestration,
humor and pathos, all with a distinctly modern sensibility
still stands as one of the most affecting, well-crafted, and origiRufus Wainwright
nal works of popular music of the century to date, rivaled only
Want One
Dreamworks, 2003 by "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" for sheer breadth of appeal.
True, I have met a small number of people who take issue
with Rufus's voice, which I guess I can understand.
Impassioned and soaring, velvety-rich and, admittedly, nasal, though never whiny
very approximately, somewhere between Thorn Yorke and Billie Holiday
his voice
is unmistakable and perhaps something of an acquired taste. Be forewarned (or,
preferably, be excited as hell): The voice is inescapable on "Want." Thanks to the wonders of double- and triple-tracking and the remarkable patience of producer Marius
deVries (who's also recorded such pipes as Bjork, Madonna and Bowie), some of these
tracks have over 300 Rufuses belting it out, vying with some of the biggest, brassiest
orchestral arrangements in recent memory. His voice is also the first thing we hear
on the album, humming in delicate and lushly layered counterpoint that gives way
unexpectedly to a march-like solo tuba. This is "Oh What a World," which functions
as an analogue to the sprightly "Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk" on their "Poses"
album, finding much of its humor in the preposterous orchestration, which spirals
rapidly outward as snares buzz, pizzicatos plink, beUs chime out and Ravel's "Bolero"
gets quoted. For all its maximalist tendencies
realized most bombastically on the
epically intense "Go or Go Ahead" and the swaggering, gospelly "14th Street"
"Want" also finds time for a few quiet places: the searing solo piano ballad "Pretty
Things," the lovely "Natasha" and the gently droll pop-culture canticle "Vibrate" ("My
phone's on vibrate for you/Electroclash is karaoke, too").
There are simply too many great songs here to mention them all. If anything, this

album is more consistent than "Poses," and it's certainly more
wide-ranging, encompassing nearly every mood imaginable
(except maybe disinterested detachment.) And where his previous
album fell off slightly towards the end of its running time, "Want"
saves perhaps its finest moment for the closing slot: the devastatingly powerful "Dinner at Eight," written for his father in the aftermath of a horrible falling-out. Even in its lighter moments, and
despite its accessibility, "Want" isn't exactly easy listening. When
it's as essential as this, art rarely is.

The Wrens, The Meadowlands
To me they're just place names on the turnpike signs that flash The Wrens
by en route between Philly and New York, but I'm sure a Jerseyan The
Meadowlands
would instantly pick up on the world of differencebetween the connotations of "Secaucus" and those of "the Meadowlands." The first Absolutely
is an electrifying, wildly eclectic, bursting-at-the-seams exploration Kosher, 2003
of the energy and textural possibilities of the rock song "form," and
the latter is a rather more understated and cohesive (dare I say mature?) collection of
good, old-fashioned (almost mid-'9os-sounding) lyrical rock, not averse to melody and
bit of grit. Actually, both are fine slabs ofinfectious guitararama by indierock's prodigal New Jersey sons, the Wrens. Never mind that it's been seven years since their
simultaneously widely lauded and criminally overlooked "masterpiece" (that would
be "Secaucus"); just be happy that we have "The Meadowlands." Their intense Olde
Club set last weekend, though it drew most of its material from the new record,
wasn't exactly an accurate representation of the album, which tempers its experi-

mental edges with a relatively measured, comfortable tone that owes more than a little to the golden age of mid-'9os mid-tempo rock. Hey, ain't no shame in that. It's not

as though the Wrens are turning into a nostalgia act. In fact, don't worry about comparisons at all, to the band's earlier work or to anyone else's. "The Meadowlands" may
not be a masterpiece, but it stands well enough on its own merits. Love it for its hummable hooks, its triphammer guitars, its ringing harmonies, its straight-up bass drive,

its occasional accordion and synth flavors, and its vocal tinges of Billy Corgan. Oh,

wait, never mind that last bit.

McCabe exhibit traces origins, development of anime and manga
BY EMILY GASSER
egasserl@swarthmore.edu

So what is anime, anyway? For starters, "anime" is
actually a shortening of the word "animation," according
to Lan Xuan Le 'O4, curator of the new exhibition in
McCabe Library. But make sure you don't confuse the two.
"The reason people categorize anime differently is due
to the incredible diversity and sophistication of its content," she said. "Japanese animation, or anime, covers a
wide range of topics from very innocent kids' shows like
Pokemon and Speed Racer to more adult subjects, like
stalkers in Perfect Blue or even pornographic materials
like La Blue Girl. The extremely sophisticated stories of
anime set it apart from American-style animation."
The exhibition, entitled "Cultural Imports: From
Pokemon to Hello Kitty," will be on dislplay in McCabe
Library next week. Complementing the exhibit will be a
talk, "From Japohists to Otaku: America
Japan in
Cultural and Historical Perspective," given by leading
anime scholar Susan Napier from University of Texas, on
Oct. 3 at 4:15 p.m. in Science Center 199. "Cowboy Bebop
Movie" will be shown on Oct. 9 at 8 p.m. in LPAC.
The exhibition will focus on the origins and development of anime and manga, their global presence, and the
fan culture which has sprung up around them. The material should be interesting to the general public, not just
&

anime junkies.
"The exhibit is geared towards people who don't know
anything [about anime]," Le said. "For a fan of anime and
manga, this is just a treat, an acknowledgement that what
they love is important. A fan would know pretty much
everything that is covered in this exhibit. However, for
your average Joe, this exhibit should show you all the
basics in the world of anime and manga."
Anime got its start in the early 20th century in Japan
with silent black-and-white films, and has developed into a
world-wide phenomenon, encompassing both film and television. The tradition of drawing anime characters with
huge, saucer-like eyes and round heads was begun by
Osamu Tezuka in the middle of the century. He based his
drawings off of pre-war Disney characters, and used their
outlandish features to make them more expressive.
And what about manga? "Manga is an older, native
Japanese word that means something like 'crazy drawings'
to set it off from more formal painting styles," co-curator
Michael Pasahow 'O4 said.
In the modern sense, manga is the Japanese equivalent
of a comic book. Manga is often turned into anime, Le said.
"It's kind of like making a cartoon series of Sandman or
Dilbert."
For more information on anime, visit www.anipike.com
or www.tokyopop.com, or read Susan Napier's book,
"Anime: From Akira To Princess Mononoke."

Film Society
caters to taste
BY MELISSA PHRUKSHART
mphruksl@swarthmore. edu
Film Society is a 20-plus-year-old organization that focuses on
bringing independent cinema to the Swarthmore community.
This year, headed by Duolan Li 'O4 and Stella Kyriakopoulos 'O5,
Film Society plans to revamp itself by doing more promotion and
making independent films accessible to all. "We want films that
people want to see," Li said in an interview.

Film Society differs from other organizations like Movie
Committee in that it centers exclusively around "independent
films that have been in the film circuit for the past couple of
years," Li said. "The distributors we contact are New Yorker,
Kino International, Zeitgeist Films a lot of art house films, stuff
you'd find at the Ritz [an art house movie theater in
Philadelphia]. This year we also want to showcase local Philly

Hong Kong's finest and strangest
Films of Fury pays tribute to the best martial arts films around
BY MELISSA PHRUKSHART
mphruksl@swarthmore.edu

Every Thursday, a contingennt
of hardcore action film fans gathers with a single-minded focus.
Films of Fury, an organization
committed to showing martial
arts films, was started two years
ago by Ben Hamilton 'O3. Today,
Ben Sailer 'O6 and Wynn Wu 'O4
have taken the reins.
The name "Films of Fury" is
an homage to "one of the best
kung fu movies ever made, in
many people's opinion—'Fists of
Fury' with Bruce Lee," Sailer
said.
Films of Fury specializes in
Asian action movies, usually from
Hong Kong. Most are in Chinese
with English subtitles, but, if
there is no other alternative, the
group will show a dubbed movie.
"It makes them stupider,"

Sailer said. "Sometimes dubbing
will be done on purpose, but that's
rare."
Movies the group screened last
year included "Shaolin Soccer,"
"Fong Sai Yuk" and "Bullet in the
Head."
"Suggestions are appreciated,"
Sailer added. "We'll order the

12

movies or find them if they're on
campus already." Films of Fury
especially favors films by John

Woo and Steven Chow and those
starring the actors Jet Li, Bruce
Lee, Chow Yun Fat, Leslie Cheung

and Tony Leung.
Sailer chooses the film careful-

ly every week, scouring movie

review websites, and gaining sug-

gestions through word of mouth.
"I'll look at online retailers and
just browse through all the different movies they have. A lot of the
time I'll look through lists of

movies until the title strikes me
as being interesting," Sailer said.
"If I've seen it's gotten good
reviews, I'll get it.
"There are different kinds of
good action movies," he said.
"There's the kind that are good
because of plot—'Bullet in the
Head' was a legitimately good
movie with good plot, good characters and a message in there
somewhere. I also really like
movies that are so good because
they're so bad. Sometimes action
movies are so bad because they're
so terrible, like the movie we
showed last week, 'Chinese Super
Ninjas.' It had poor production

quality and a terrible script."

The group attracts 15 to 20
viewers each week.
"There's a pretty wide range of
people who show up," Sailer said.
"There's people who come who

know all about the movies we're
watching and know a lot more
than I do about the genre, but

there's a lot of people who just
saw the posters for that week and
thought it sounded kind of cool."

And contrary to popular belief,
"last year there were a few girls
that came pretty regularly."
Sailer reported the atmosphere
of the screenings to be relaxed and
open, with frequent audience par-

ticipation.
"Watching movies with Films
of Fury and the people who come
regularly makes it that much
more enjoyable. It's fun to laugh
at things with people, and people
will generally yell stuff out if they
feel like it. We just generally have
a good time."
Films of Fury recently ordered

filmmakers."
In the past, Film Society has been known for screening world
cinema, classic Hollywood, French new wave, European art
films, and experimental films. "We serve refreshments," Li
added. "One of our traditions is serving Pabst beer."
Movies shown last year included Buster Keaton's silent film
"College," "Faust," by progressive filmmaker Jan Svankmajer,
experimental movies by Yoko Ono, and an ethnography of
Senegalese women by Vietnamese filmmaker Trinh Min-Ha.
About 15 to 20 people show up for each showing. "The most
we've had was at the student video fest last year," Li said. "We
had over 50 people, and that's pretty good, considering it was a
Wednesday night. A lot of people who come to our showings are
really into indie movies, or are Film Studies majors or minors.
Film Society definitely caters to a certain type of taste."
One of Film Society's biggest passions is its insistence on
16mm film. "We only try to show 16mm print because, except for
Movie Committee, every other club shows things on VHS and
DVD," Li said. "We're pretty adamant on showing that. We think
it's important to preserve the film media. The reason DVD and
VHS are so popular is because of the commercial impetus. I
think it takes away from the film experience. But we're not
opposed to showing DVD—we will if we can't get something on
16mm."
Despite the obscurity of many of their past titles, Film Society
aims to reach out. "We're doing more promotion and showing
films that have been in the film festival circuit in the past few
years—stuff people might have heard about and want to watch,"
Li said. "It's so easy to go to movies at Marple 10 and see big commercial blockbusters, but it's hard to go to film festivals or to the
Ritz to see an indie film. Our whole objective is to bring it here.
We're also trying to put fliers in the Ville, too, so it's open not just
to students but to the Swarthmore community."
The Film Society showed "Together," an award-winning
Swedish film directed by Lukas Moodysson, on Wednesday.
"Hiroshima, Mon Amour," a drama by Resnais about a white
woman and a Japanese man, is on their agenda. The group meets

Weird and wise
BY JOHN TUTHILL
jtuthill@swarthmore.edu
Monday night comes again, and out crawl those mysterious
SWIL constituents from points north and south and all over
campus. Monday night is movie night for SWIL, the
Swarthmore Warders of Imaginative Literature. It's a night
that begins with the introduction of some of the strangest and
wackiest films ever made.
At the end of each semester, SWIL meets to jostle and bicker about the movie list for the upcoming onslaught of movie
nights. This week, SWIL presents "The Truman Show," followed by Jan Svankmeyer's "Alice," then "The Purple Rose of
Cairo" and so on, into the depths of obscurity and oddity. The
films and their watchers can be found each Monday at 10 p.m.
in room 101 of the Science Center.
The little-known truth is that we all, as Swarthmore students, are official members of SWIL, while only those who regularly attend SWIL meetings are able to achieve their sentience and become non-members. SWIL movie night is a fine
introduction to the intricacies of SWIL and an opportunity to
see some fine movies with some weird people. Anybody is welthat's all of us
come, and all members
will be graciously
received at any SWIL movie night or other event.

The smell of popcorn wafting through the aisles, people whispering excitedly to friends while chomping on
candy bars, the occasional crying baby, and, most importantly, an engrossing story on screen. It's all part of the
movie-going experience, and various organizations are
bringing the cinema to Swat. One of these organizations
is Movie Committee, which screens current and old
favorite movies on campus, most recently "Finding
Nemo" and, last weekend, "A Mighty Wind."
Movie Committee is composed of a group of students
who decide which films to show to Swarthmore students
on a regular basis. The process is fairly simple: The committee meets once before every semester and the members select different movies they would like to have
shown on campus. Voting takes place, and, if there are
any time slots left, the members review other movies at
the meeting. The committee is also open to some suggestions; chairperson Woot Lervisit 'O4 said all a student has
to do is e-mail someone from the committee and your
movie could be subject to review. How does one become a
part of this organization?
"Student Council sends out applications in the middle
of the semester. Once you get on the committee, you're in
for all four years," Lervisit said.
The committee largely shows movies on 16 mm
"because it's better quality." However, they sometimes
show the films on DVD as well.
To many who might be confused about the time and
place of various movie showings, screenings are held
every weekend in the LPAC cinema and the new Science
Center's big and small lecture rooms. Lervisit said the
the committee provided incentive for everyone to attend,
whether a fan of comedy or drama.
"We show a diverse selection of movies, a few from
each category," Lervisit said.
Movie Committee gives Student Budget Committee a
budget at the beginning of the year and then recieves the
desired amount of funding. When the committee was
founded, 40 movies were shown a year (20 per semester).
But, because of a recent cutback on money to student
organizations, there will be fewer movies shown this
year. Usually, the committee shows one movie a week on
Friday or Saturday and two if there is money left over
from funding.
The atmosphere of the screenings is extremely relaxed
and the audience is often diverse in demographics. At the
viewing of "A Mighty Wind," this was strikingly appar•

Character not lost in Translation'
BY ESTER BLOOM

eblooml@swarthmore.edu

The burgeoning subculture of fan fiction pairs two
romantically unaffiliated fictional characters and creates
for them a story of their own. The Internet overflows with
fan fiction about Harry and Hermione from "Harry
Potter," Xena and Gabrielle from "Xena: Warrior
Princess," and various Star Trek captains with each other.
Whether consciously or not, what Sofia Coppola has
created in her new film "Lost in Translation" is a piece of
fan fiction that ingeniously pairs Bill Murray's character,
Herman Blume, from "Rushmore," with Scarlet
Johansson's character, Rebecca, from "Ghost World."
Devising a fantastical erotic scenario for those two
characters would be untrue to both. Instead, Coppola simply places them in the same swanky Tokyo hotel. Their
mutual sense of alienation, coupled with insomnia, is
enough to guarantee that Murray and Johansson will meet
and recognize the other as a kindred spirit.
Murray's character, an aging movie star, is in Japan to
earn $2 million shooting whiskey commercials.
Johansson's, a 22-year-old Yale grad, is in Japan accompanying her husband, a photographer, who is shooting movie
stars.
Both spend their copious unstructured time wandering
around the hotel or the city alone—and then, once they
meet, together. It is in this aspect of the film particularly
that Coppola reveals herself as a skillful director. Whether
Johansson is examining Tokyo's video arcades and high
tech billboards, or temples and a flower-arranging class,
Coppola maintains the same calm pace.
The effect produces more than a consistency of tone.
Coppola captures vividly what is like not to be in Tokyo,
but to be an American tourist in Tokyo. To view the city at

arm's length, fascinated by the details and equally unwilling to attempt to delve beneath the surface.
Neither Murray nor Johansson speaks Japanese. Much
of the film's humor derives from simple yet effective sight
gags (Murray in a packed elevator of Japanese business
men, standing a head taller than the rest of them) and typical cultural miscommunications. Without being offensive,
the film manages to be surprisingly funny as well as, eventually, touching.
The relationship that develops between Murray and
Johansson is what allows both to transcend the limits of
their original "Rushmore" and "Ghost World" characters.
That relationship feels far more believable and, at the
same time, more complex and unique, than what
Hollywood usually comes up with.
Naturally, since they are Man and Woman, and even
more so because as individuals they are so similar, sexual
tension creeps into the story. At no point does it disappear,
but, refreshingly, at no point does it take over. It becomes
just another layer of their many-layered friendship.
Bill Murray deserves special praise for elevating wry,
truly funny disaffection to an art form. If you couldn't tell
from "Groundhog Day" or if you thought Rushmore was a
fluke, his performance here should erase all reasonable

doubt: The man has talent.

Coppola's previous film, "The Virgin Suicides," while
was also self-indulgent and slow.
At moments, "Lost in Translation" feels like it could use
some tough love editing.
But as a whole, it succeeds where "Virgin Suicides"
failed, managing to be a thought-provoking, visually
remarkable mood piece. The risks she takes here, such as
prioritizing character over plot, pay off: They establish her
as an artist as well as one of the most successful practitioners of fan fiction to date.

"The elderly couple was having a really good time
laughing at the dirty jokes. It was cute," Veronica Lim 'O7
said.

Some students say they are grateful for the opportunity to have on-campus access to fairly new releases at no
cost. Willa Kramer 'O7 said she was "glad that [the

...

Class work
An extension of the different extracurricular
organizations that show flicks on campus is the
academic department of film and media studies,
led by Professor Patricia White. The introductory
course in the interdisciplinary study creates for
students a basis to evaluate films through both
technical and analytical means. The first few
weeks of the class are devoted to ideas relating to
cinematography, continuity and montage, sound,
etc. As the class progresses, a closer look at film
history and many different kinds of cinema, such
as the documentary and Third and New National

Cinema, is reviewed. The latter part of the introduction is devoted to media studies, including
aspects of television that deal with genres, history
and the institution of broadcasting. All of this provides a well-rounded general knowledge of film
and television as a medium for popular culture.

Came for message, stayed for bread
BY EVA HOLMAN
eholman2@swarthmore.edu

On Saturday afternoon, it drizzled and
cleared up, and, right around 3 p.m., a crowd of
students, adults, and children gathering in the
amphitheater were caught in a torrential
downpour. But did they leave? Hell, no. They
were promised a political puppet show and
their fair share ofhomemade sourdough bread,
and they were going to stay for it.
The Bread and Puppet Show Theater gave a
free performance of its "Insurrection Mass
with Funeral March for a Rotten Idea" for
Swarthmore College, following a morning
workshop open to any students interested in
participating in the show. Despite weather
worries, the mood in the air before the show
began was jubilant. Laying plastic garbage
bags between themselves and the wet grass,
the enthusiastic crowd danced and clapped
along to traditional music as the troupe set up

for the performance.
Though the show's format was modeled
after a traditional Christian mass, the puppeteers immediately established the mass's
irreverent tone in the "Introduction of the
Gods," which presented "the god of the stone he
is sitting on" and "the god of the buses that take

people to insurrection masses."
Though the show had an anti-war theme, the
company presented it in a t6ngue-and-cheek
way. The mass's "Testimony" lead the audience
through a mock eight-step program on "How to
Turn Stress into Success," which included
"choosing an enemy," taking "the grief of the
afflicted and turning it into rage," and producing "a reason for war." The puppeteers acted
out sweeping reason under the rug (complete
with a cloud puppet marked "reason"), and, in
one of the most popular sequences, donned faceless, black-suit-wearing costumes representing
capitalists and randomly chose an "enemy"
with a finger-pointing machine.
The climax of the show, the "Scripture

Reading," was nothing more than a verbatim
speech by President Bush. Presented immediately after

a haunting interpretation of Walt

October 2, 2003

Whitman's wartime ppem "Beat Beat Drums,"
reading of the speech (which included

the

phrases such as "who them was") was meant to
emphasize the absurdity of America's reason
for war. At the show's end, the puppeteers
summarized their straightforward message:
"The rotten idea of today is Victory over
The puppeteers
everything is a bad idea.'
then led the audience to the Lang Music
Building, where they served sourdough bread
"

slathered with pesto.

Bread and Puppet Show Theater founder
Peter Schumann pointed to war as "a survival
technique."
"We are capitalists who exploit people,"
Schumann said. "We have to take money out of
people's pockets to make a living."
Schumann said he recognized the discomfort some might feel with the show's political
message and said the street puppet form made
his message especially poignant. Addressing
the students who came to the following morning's workshop, he described how the form
"forces people who don't want to be forced to
hear your message...ln inside theater, the people pay money and come to you. In street theater, you go to them."
Indeed, he put that message to reality for the
students who came to the Sunday workshop
wanting to learn more. The students played
instruments, donned cardboard wings and
learned to "fly" puppet-style. They then practiced their own puppet show, called
"Hallelujah," which they later performed outside of Sharpies. While the workshop let students perform a puppet show rather than simply watch, the puppeteers explained little about
how they chose their shows' formats designed
their puppets.
"I thought they were going to teach us about
street theater, how you make a performance
work and engage passers-by, but all we did was
perform something they had already written,
with no explanation of how it works," Sophie
Horowitz 'O7 said.
But, as Schumann may agree, there is little
secret to his company's success. All you need
is the bread.

What are you

doing?!
In a way, I understand.
When you (or your parents) pay $33,000+ for you to go to this
school, you feel like you own it. You misuse paper from the printing
centers, you 'borrow' lounge furniture for your room, you take entire
tubs of ice cream out of Sharpies for the party you're throwing.
I'll admit it, I still have a couple of dirty bricks taken from the new
dorm construction site in my room. Um, don't ask.
But taking a SQU sign from the IC? What were you thinking? If
you're drunk, go vomit somewhere or play on the railroad tracks.
Making a political message? Don't hide, stand up for your beliefs.
Stealing a sign? That's just lame.
Vandals, just grow up and go back to taking silverware from

The real meaning
We have a problem.
No, the problem isn't the fact that the IC was vandalized. It was an intimidating moment for many students,
the sign took major damage that's going to take timeand
money to fix and the fragile peace of our campus has
once more been disturbed but that's not the problem.
Look at smaller, pissant issues like the homophobic
scrawls on the walls of the men's bathroom or the nearconstant stream of almost caricatured anti-Swarthmore
rants on the Daily Jolt, and you're actually closer.
Look at the cynicism about the Meaning of
Swarthmore capital campaign. Or the overwhelming
negative response to the football cuts that "shocked"
President Bloom.
Actually, what you should really look at is the administration's response to all of the above, which was to
ignore them and maintain their policies. The problem is
that the people who run Swarthmore don't really know
Swarthmore. Not anymore.

There are images ofSwarthmore as a sort of socialist
Utopia, a place where bright-eyed Renaissance children
live in harmony, fighting injustice and discovering deep
truths. This is an image that, if it ever really existed outside the nostalgic hindsight of alumni, is certainly an
incomplete description of Swarthmore today.
The world of the early 21st century is a more complex, less innocent time than the 1960s culture that largely created the modern image of Swarthmore. The hippies have graduated, and even if we believe that Quaker
consensus or flower power or some other mystical force
acted to preserve peace and love on campus, that force is

long gone. Most of us fall far outside the Swattie stereotype in politics and culture; a small but increasing number of us, perceiving ourselves as marginalized for not
fitting the classic vision of Swarthmore the liberal arts
paradise, have become embittered and skeptical about
Swarthmore "ideals." Now a few seem to have begun
taking joy in subverting them, to the point of committing crimes against their symbols.
And the administration doesn't seem to know, or if
they do, they won't admit it.
Why, after hiring a dean of multicultural affairs and
an IC director presumably to engage these issues, does

the administration seem less aware than ever? Why do
students, whether IC representatives or College
Republicans, have to draft a letter to the deans before
they even recognize and respond to these events? Why
does their response just consist of an e-mail basically
asking us to fix the problem ourselves?
The deans are wrong when they keep telling us the
beautiful Swarthmore community can maintain its
integrity and idealism through these minor, anomalous
crisis moments. These crises are symptoms of lurking
prejudice, of alienated minorities of various stripes, of
deep cultural divides that run through our student body.
Unfortunately, most of us are not primarily here to
build a better community and ensure a bright future for
the college, at least not directly, and for all the glowing
pictures drawn of Swatties of the past, we doubt any students ever were. It isn't our fault that the face of the
campus is changing; the conservative revolution, the
increasing polarization over issues like affirmative
action, the war in Iraq, Israel and Palestine
none of
these are local problems we ought to be asked to fix. The
administration can't keep calling on the mystical force
of Quaker consensus to make the specters of student
alienation and polarization go away. The fact is that
there is probably no single set of values held by even the
majority of Swarthmore students anymore, no more
knee-jerk reactions we can feel safe defending.
Ifthe deans could let go of their precious image of our
shining college on the hill (and the hefty alumni donations this image generates), they might be able to actively address these root causes instead of burying their
heads ostrich-like until a sudden outbreak of symptoms
forces their hand. Whatever virtues and vices today's
Swarthmore community has, they must be dealt with on
their own terms.
Like it or not, the administration will at some point
have to stop advertising the meaning of Swarthmore

Our black privilege

degree. Half of uscan thank our
parents for buying this privilege outright. Half of us can

thank financial aid for assis-

diploma. Every single one of us
is privileged. To paraphrase
what Spider-Man said of power

TARU TAYLOR

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■

"With great privilege come
great responsibility."
One doesn't have to be
superhero to take on responsi
bility. One doesn't have t
swing through skyscrapers t
assume the mantle of civic

duty. One simply has to be a
man or a woman. But political correctness discourages man
hood and womanhood amongst blacks and women, for it roman
ticizes victimhood. It idealizes the victim. It renders otherwis
legitimate disciplines such as Black studies and Women's stuc
ies mere Victim studies.
Every legitimate discipline, as a body of knowledge, is dialec
tical, for each discipline is a series of studies of opposing ideolo
gies. Each discipline (possibly excepting mathematics) track
the historical movements of the theses and antitheses pertinen
to its field of inquiry. Even the natural sciences, as Thoma
Kuhn's "Structure of Scientific Revolutions" reveals, are essen
tially historical narratives of competing paradigms and para
digm shifts. Twentieth-century physics, for example, come
down to the debate between Albert Einstein and NielsBohr as t
whether or not God plays dice. Anyway, Black studies, as a dis
cipline, bears witness unto the great dialogues of Booker T
Washington and W.E.B. Dußois, Kwame Nkrumah and Franz
Fanon, amongst others. At bottom, Black studies is the dialecti
of the militant ideology of Marcus Garvey vs. the bourgeois ideology ofDußois.
But black studies, as a pseudodiscipline, isn't interested in
dialogue. It's about the monologue of the victim. No dialectic
here. It's the black bourgeois monolith of victimology. Hence
this pseudodiscipline neutralizes the Garveyite passion for self
reliance and equity. It neutralizes black agency. It encourage
the Dußoisian passions of resentment and envy. It entrenche
black victimhood. Dußois is its God. Rev. Dr. King is its patron
saint. "Somebodiness" is its holy grail.
Victimology and identity politics (read "victim politics") ar

I'll show you some victims. Come hop on the

much-needed perspective, if he wrote a companion to his "Trul
Disadvantaged" and called it "The Truly Underprivileged."

Columnist also disrespects victims
Dear Editor:
I am writing in response to Randy Goldstein's opinion piece ("Chalkings disrespect victims," Sept. 25)
about the statements written on the Magill walkway to
commemorate Sept. 1L I agree with Goldstein that 9/11
should be used as a day to remember the victims of such
a terrible event; as my roommate says, "People died;
death is not political."

Goldstein, however, undermines the entire point of
his argument when he makes unsubstantiated and
derogatory remarks about Rachel Corrie (calling her a
"brainwashed radical, not someone worth remembering on America's day of remembrance"). His lack of
knowledge about who Rachel was and what she stood
for make his remarks just as inflammatory as the political chalkings which he complains are not respectful.
As Rachel's cousin, I know firsthand that the death of
3,000 Americans upset her very much, and it was precisely 9/11 which got Rachel involved in the peace
movement for which she gave her life.

In fact, on the first anniversary of the attacks she
a "Convergence for Peace" in Olympia,
Wash., which, according to the pamphlet advertising it,
involved "bread-making and a candlelight vigil in order
to create a space for critical thinking, hope for peace
and social justice."
It is often very easy to feel oneself removed from
such momentous events as Sept. 11 or the ongoing crisis
in the Middle East. However, it is important to remember that the victims of Sept. 11, the ISMers in Palestine
and everyone else involved in world events today are
real people.
Rachel had a boyfriend, went to college and helped
me blow my nose with toilet paper when I was a little
girl. I would hope that, if Goldstein wishes Swarthmore
to respect the memory of all the innocents who died in
the Twin Towers, he will set an example by respecting
organized

Rachel Corrie and all those like her who died for their
belief in peace.

Don't blame SPAC for chalkings
Dear Editor:
To me, Sept. 11 is a highly emo-

tional day. It brings back all sorts of
memories; fear because I didn't
know if my father was dead or alive,
relief when he finally came home
(though shaken and covered with
ash and dust) and sadness for my
friends who were not as lucky as I
was. Because 9/11 means so much to
me, I, a SPAC member, helped
organize the 9/11 remembrance
events.
Naturally, I was quite upset
while reading Randy Goldstein's
highly
offensive
column
("Chalkings disrespect victims,"
Sept. 25) about our Peaceful
Reflection quilt on Magill Walk. We
honestly intended it to be a creative
way for students to express their
feelings about 9/11 and hopes for a
more peaceful future. I completely
agree that a day such as 9/11 should
be reserved for reflection, grieving

and the like; to do otherwise is
insensitive, crass and inappropriate. However, I also feel that his
attempt to twist the truth and make
it seem as if we deliberately tried to
use 9/11 to advance a left-wing agenda is nothing less than deplorable.
Just because certain individuals

chose to chalk highly politicized
statements on the walkway does not
mean that SPAC as a group
endorsed or condoned such actions.
In fact, we wanted quite the contrary; during the planning of the

activity in question, we even considered adding a note to our original sign asking people to respect the
integrity of our quilt and refrain
from chalking such messages.
However, we realized that there was
no point in doing such a thing we

have no control over what individual Swatties want to do, and we figured that people who were going to
chalk these things would probably

ignore the sign anyway. To say that
SPAC, or any other group, tried to
use 9/11 as an opportunity to make
inflammatory political statements
is grossly inaccurate. This is to say
nothing of the fact that we simply

don't know for sure who actually
they can't
did write these things
even be definitively linked to specific individuals, let alone larger campus organizations.
It seems to me that Goldstein's
own personal disdain for the beliefs
expressed or the groups in question
colored much of what he said, as a
great deal of it has no basis in reality. I find it interesting that the other
SPAC-sponsored 9/11 event, a beautiful, peaceful vigil outside of
Parrish, was notably absent from
the editorial. Perhaps if there had
been more signs and leftist slogans
and shouting, it might have garnered a mention.

Said's death rocks Palestinian community
BY SAED ATSHAN
satshanl@swarthmore.edu
Sept. 25,2003, is a date I will never forget. I shed more
tears that day than ever before in my life. My heart has

never ached so deeply. That day, the death of Edward
Said marked the most poignant sense of loss within me. I
was fortunate enough to meet him two years ago when he
came to Swarthmore, and I nearly fainted from how overwhelmingly exhilarating it was to greet him in person.
Said has been my role model throughout my life. He has
been my sole source of inspiration, and despite his death,
the spirit by which he led his life will be with me forever.
Said was revered, not just by me, but by Palestinians
all over the world. No other Palestinian has ever devoted their life to our cause more than he. Said was considered the spokesman of the Palestinian people, and he
embodied our struggle throughout his life. Said continually advocated the legitimacy and urgency of
Palestinian sovereignty, and so our political strife dominated his life. He lived in exile in America, the country
most deaf to Palestinian pleas. He had to combat

America's perception of Palestinians as merely terrorists, and he helped us gain our right to be respected as
humans. Said still managed to reach out to people
heart to heart, soul to soul. He kept the Palestinian spirit alive in the West, despite the endless forces attempting
to deaden it. As many Israeli historians and politicians
claimed that there was never such a thing as Palestine
October 2, 2003

and that Palestinians never existed, Said vehemently
challenged this notion through his visibility and out-

spokenness.
Said will be missed by Columbia University, where he
was chair of the English literature department, and by
his alma maters, Princeton and Harvard. Yet he will also
be profoundly missed by academics and intellectuals
everywhere. His remarkable books, including
"Orientalism," have revolutionized the way we perceive
ourselves and the world around us. Said continued postcolonial discourse in the West and helped us better
understand imperialism in its many shapes and forms.
He reminded us that the legacy of imperialism is still
with us.
I am sure that Said will be remembered by all peaceloving people. He was a Palestinian Christian, married to
a Lebanese Quaker, and upheld Islam in great virtue. He
also cautioned us of the dangers of extremism within any
tradition. He was a father of two, musician, scholar and
advocate of social justice for all oppressed. His egalitarian ideals provided all of us idealists with a pragmatic
voice of reason.
The famous Lebanese writer, Kahlil Gibran, once said,
"The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more
joy you can contain." Let us remember these words, and,
in true Quaker fashion, hold Said "in the light." I hope
that everyone in the Swarthmore community will celebrate Said's legacy of brilliance, eloquence and resilience
that has earned him love and respect worldwide.

It's that time of year again

all the fuss?
The big news has been that the World Trade

two weeks ago in
Cancun to begin a sec-

talks.

after the last round of
talks, known as the
Uruguay Round, obliterated trade barriers that pro-

tect human rights and the environment by taxing
imports which were produced using child labor or
environmentally dangerous methods.
In the same way that a domestic free-market economy promotes a "race to the bottom" to see who can
offer the best deals on highly demanded commodities,
which often pits workers against one another, so too
does free trade.
On account of this competitive market paradigm,
workers in countries who are called upon to work in
inhumane conditions and for miserable wages do so
out of desperation, to the despair of the U.S.'s undercut labor unions. However, the WTO sees these human
sacrifices as "non-commercial interests," and depends
upon that good ol' invisible hand to set prices that are
fair for all. We all know how well that one usually

playing

field for the less developed

In Cancun, the developing countries had hoped to
achieve this by banning the $3OO billion annual export
subsidies that the U.S. and the E.U. pay their farmers.
But this was a lost cause. Although the U.S. and E.U.

demand an equal competitive opportunity for all
countries, they pay off their own farmers to flood the
market in grains, impoverishing the small guys in
developing countries who can't keep up.
The reason for this? The U.S. needs to protect its
farmers, most of whom run multi-billion-dollar industrial farms in the Midwest. Therefore, in Cancun, the
only offer that they gave to these countries was cutting a small amount of their own subsidies in
exchange for increased U.S. investment within the
developing countries' borders.
Surely we could have seen this coming. I mean, we
have an election to win here, people. There is no way
that the U.S. is about to compromise the friendship of
Bush's support from the U.S. farm sector next
November.

But the developing countries weren't messing
around this time. Tired of depending on ill-focused foreign investment, these countries wanted more for
their domestic economies. (Fairness might be a good
place to start.) That the U.S. had no intention of giving
this to them became clear only two days into the talks,
and so, in an unprecedented move, they simply got up
and walked out, to the glee of thousands of protesters
and our very own SPAC kids shouting out from NYC.
So where do you, Swattie drinking coffee in
McCabe, fit into all this? Well, for starters, you are
drinking McCabe coffee. If you look down on that pretty little cup of McCabe coffee you will see the words

"equal exchange."
This means that you are drinking coffee that was
traded in a way that is environmentally and socially
responsible and labeled as such by the Fair Trade
Labeling Organization International rather than pro-

duced adhering to the principles of the free market. In
other words, you are supporting the little guys like
those who walked out of the trade rounds. So the solution? Drink more McCabe coffee and promote other
fairly traded goods like the ones at www.globalex-

change.com.

Kudos to vigilant students
for protesting World Bank

Alums want
living wage

Dear Editor:
I would like to thank the conscientious students who arranged to
protest the World Bank information
session last Friday.
Their efforts to raise the level of
awareness regarding this heavyhanded financial establishment are

Dear Editor:
I am writing in response to
"Poll shows alums give, but not
enough" (Sept. 25).
I found it interesting that while
Swarthmore finds its alumni generally philanthropic, it struggles
to garner adequate donations.
Perhaps if the college played
more to its alumni's "Quaker"

in keeping with Swarthmore's tradition of promoting a more equitable society.
The World Bank representative
sent to indoctrinate and recruit
Swarthmore students was none
other than Daniel Mont, a known
economist.
In the past, Dr. Mont has
unabashedly exhibited his perverse
love for economics as a social welfare policy professor at Cornell
University, an institution known
for its right-wing tendencies.
After he finished corrupting the
nation's youth, he then turned his
attention to Capitol Hill, where he
further promoted his selfish economic ends in his capacity as a congressional disability policy adviser.

He has also financed his economic reign through the publication of his book, "A Different Kind

Protesters at
Swarthmore fought
valiantly to protect our
sacred campus.
The list of his indiscretions continues, but suffice to say his current
goal is to "both broaden and deepen
the World Bank's involvement with

sensibilities ("social justice, civic
responsibility and a strong sense
of community"), it would receive
more generous donations.
For example, if alumni felt that
their money would go to pay

Swarthmore employees a living
wage
furthering economic justice and a more equitable community
rather than having their
hard-earned dollars spent on
fancy chairs and expensive stone,

perhaps they would donate to
Swarthmore College in the same

manner that they donate their

organizations.

From Al Gore's decision not to run to Howard Dean pushing
John Kerry from front-runner status to the surprise success of
Wesley Clark, the Democratic presidential nomination battle
has certainly had its share of presumed front-runners and surprising changes offortune. Will
there be any more twists and
turns?
A sizable group of political
observers believe that there
will be and have pumped up the

notion that Hillary Clinton
may jump into the race. The
theory is that Hillary was planning to wait until 2008 to run,
believing that any Democrat

was sure to lose to Bush. With
Bush's approval ratings falling
steadily, though, Hillary has
become
worried that a
Democrat could beat Bush and
thus kill any chance ofher running until 2012. Thus, she is
carefully
watching Bush's

PATRICK HART

The Drawing Board

rankings, weighing whether to

make her move now or wait
four years.
That, at least, is the theory, but it is not a very impressive
one. Running in this election would probably not help Hillary's
long-term political stature. If she were to jump in after having
stated repeatedly that she wasn't going to run, she would have
a huge credibility problem, which opponents would be able to
exploit by painting her as an opportunist. In addition, she has
not completed her first Senate term, which is set to end in 2006,

and she would be vulnerable to the charge of inexperience, not
without reason: AU the Democrats currently running, except Al
Sharpton and Clark, have more political experience than
Hillary.

Conventional wisdom holds that Hillary would win the nomination easily if she were to enter the race. Certainly, there are
polls to support this thesis, but I believe she would have more
trouble than people think. Winning the nomination isn't about
being on top of national polls, it's about winning key primary
states. Hillary would have to contend with powerful Dean and
Clark grassroots networks in these states, and it seems doubtful
that any candidates would drop out if she entered the race. With
many party professionals already committed to one candidate
or another, a Clinton victory would be far from a sure thing.
If Hillary does not enter the race, on the other hand, she will
remain a powerful figure in the Democratic Party, have a decent
shot at capturing the vice-presidential nod (especially if the
nominee is the Clinton-connected Clark), and be the logical
front-runner for 2008 if the Democrats lose to Bush next year.
Hillary is a smart politician, and if she were going to run she
would have joined the race earlier in the year, when the field
was more open.
Why, given all this, does the idea of Hillary's running persist? There are two reasons, from different ends of the political
spectrum. There are many on the left who are desperate to beat
Bush and love the thought of Hillary sweeping in and returning
the Democrats to power. And on the right there is such hostility to and suspicion of the Clintons that it is easy to believe that
Hillary must be nefariously planning a run, even when evidence suggests otherwise.
A recent case in point: Wesley Clark has surrounded himself
with many of Bill Clinton's former associates and has garnered
kind words from the ex-president. Doesn't Clinton's nearendorsement of Clark make a Hillary run less likely? Not
according to conservative New York Times columnist William
Satire, who on Sept. 22 proposed that the Clintons were using
Clark to defeat Dean and pave the way for Hillary's nomination.
"If Bush stumbles and the Democratic nomination becomes
highly valuable," Satire wrote, "the Clintons probably think
they would be able to get Clark to step aside ... rewarding his
loyalty with second place on the ticket."
It's possible, I suppose, but unlikely. Both Clintons probably
prefer Clark to Dean, but there is no reason to believe that Clark
is not sincerely trying to win the 2004 nomination. Hillary will
probably not be joining that quest. If she does enter the race, I'll
feel stupid, but, in the meantime, don't be fooled by speculations
on Hillary running written by either Hillary-lovers or Hillaryhaters.

NASA: heir to

On the 21st of September, at 3:43 and 14 seconds p.m., a

both the scientist and the historian in me; its mission was

to investigate Jupiter and its
moons and it is, of course,
named for Galileo Galilei, who

discovered those moons nearly 400 years ago. Galileo the
Elder's insight (and exceptional eyesight) lent strength to
the Copernican model and
pushed our understanding of

step further into the realm of
science. Galileo the Younger
gave us new insights into the
fascinating variety of our own
solar system and upset our

previous expectations.

Launched in 1989, the satellite provided us the first images
of an asteroid close up (complete with a moon, much to the
surprise of terrestrial observers). More memorable were the
breathtaking images of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet's impact
on Jupiter. But the most interesting of Galileo's findings were
yet to come. In December of 1995, six years after being

launched, the spacecraft began the main phase of its mission:
studying Jupiter and its moons, Europa, Callisto, Io and
Ganymede.
Europa, it now seems likely, is covered by liquid water
under the ice that forms its surface; moreover, Ganymede
and Callisto also may bear underground seas. lo's volcanoes
were discovered to be far, far larger than any Earth has seen
for billions of years, but they are similar in other ways. The
Galileo satellite was destroyed to avoid the possibility of it
crashing into one of the watery moons, on the chance that
they might contain traces of native life. It's a radical idea,
perhaps, but it gives us a powerful incentive to return.

The man on the moon, Voyager, the
space shuttle, Galileo soon,
perhaps, a space elevator are
integral to who we are now.
It's been a bad year for NASA. The Columbia disaster
drove home the continued risks of manned space travel; the
findings from that disaster indicated the serious problems
endemic to the space program. But it's clear that space travel is essential to our culture nowadays. The man on the moon,
Voyager, the space shuttle, Galileo

are integral to who we are now. We are entranced
by the wondrous allure of space, just as we used to be spellbound by the Wild West or the Orient or the New World.

There's valuable knowledge to be had out there

and technological, from moon-mining to asteroid composition to zero-gravity construction to extraterrestrial life. As
we look at the setbacks of the past year, we should also
remember that there are great heights in our travels into the
void as well as dangerous missteps.
Where will we go from here? For the moment, our
exploratory sights are set a little closer to home
at the
promise of the new wave of Mars explorers that may bring
back a little of the red planet. Jupiter once again seems far,
far away, even as space seems tantalizingly closer
and

we will revisit Jupiter and go on to see

other venues in our solar system, and our views will be challenged even further. It's our responsibility to see that we continue to indulge our curiosity for the extraterrestrial. We've

bring us its astonishing views of Jupiter and its moons. Who

Council lauded for dedication to students
Dear Editor:
While' deleting reserved-students emails Monday, we
were surprised to see "[reserved-students] BOARD OF
MANAGERS MEETING SUMMARY: 9/19-9/20", an email sent early that morning by the Student Council CoPresidents Anna Morgan and Emiliano Rodriguez. The
letter informed students of some pressing issues discussed by the board, including the living wage, the
financial status of the college (the progress of the capital campaign and potential budget cuts) and the possi-

bility of increasing the size of the student body. The letter has already sparked discussion among students on
campus. We want to take this opportunity to draw
attention to the subtle brilliance of their letter.
In spite of restrictions placed on their participation,
Rodriguez and Morgan have used their role as
observers of the Board of Managers to draw students'
attention to what seems often ignored: those issues of
great importance to students over which they have no
formal control. By creating awareness of these proceedings, the co-presidents have begun to work toward
greater transparency of the administration and thus
taken important steps towards making the board
accountable to the student body. That our elected representatives have interpreted their duties as observers
of the board in this way is laudable. What is so outstanding about their letter is that it is the first time in

our memories that Student Council representatives

have so appropriately politicized the role of the council
in bridging the gap between the student body and the

board.
It is this

savvy and long-awaited politicization of

October 2, 2003

Student Council that distinguishes the leadership and
responsibility of our current co-presidents. We hope

that encouraging dialogue about the board will be a catalyst for continued struggle on the part of the council to
most effectively represent the student body in all
aspects of campus life. In sharing with us the proceedings of the board, the letter illustrated the extent to
which Morgan and Rodriguez's leadership can differ
from that of past councils. Their conception of leadership creates an opening for the redefinition of Student
Council's relationship to the administration. It is clear
that student body representatives should be given a
substantive voice in the proceedings of the board, not
merely allowed to observe some yet be excluded from
other (non-confidential) discussions. Indeed, everyone
in the community, administration included, should
work toward facilitating a more dynamic role for
Student Council.
The possibility of change at Swarthmore requires
subtle brilliance. The council members have begun to
show theirs. Their leadership opens a prime opportunity for all members of the community to critically
engage the issues before us. The work of others, howev-

er, is required to facilitate this engagement, in the
press, in conversation, at fireside chats, at board meetings and elsewhere. To effect needed change, we must
start somewhere; we call on all to make this a beginning. As students, we thank our representatives
Rodriguez and Morgan for this beginning: Student
Council is clearly behind us.

SWARTHMORE SPORTS IN BRIEF
Men's ultimate
Last weekend, Swat men's ultimate Frisbee competed
in a tournament at Turkey Swamp Fields in New Jersey.
The sectionals in the fall are mostly a venue for club teams
to compete, but a few college teams also attend to see how
they're going to stack up this season. Swat sent both an A
and a B team, and both fared well, considering who they
were up against. The A team finished the weekend with a
1-4 record, but it played among the likes of last year's
Master's National Champions. The B team ended the tournament with a 3-1 record against other B teams in the tournament
Zack Weintraub 'O6 said, "We have a very athletic team,
but, with the graduation of eight seniors last year, we have
to try to rebuild the experience." He also noted that the
outlook for the season seems bright and that, although this
was just a training tournament, it helped the team realize
what it needed to work on.

Women's rugby
Swarthmore women's rugby suffered a serious
defeat to York College last weekend. The Garnet fell 059 against last year's fifth-ranked Division II school.
One of the team's star players, Nicole Brunda 'O4, suffered a broken collarbone in the game. Brunda is
expected to be out for the rest of the semester, but she

is optimistic about returning for spring play. Her
injury forces the small women's team to adjust positions for the rest of the semester. Co-Captain Aja
Peters-Mason 'O4 believes that the "first two teams
[they played this year] weren't as tough, but were more
indicative of the level of team women's rugby can generally expect to play."
The team next hits the field to play the combined
Haverford and Bryn Mawr team for a chance at making
it to divisionals. The game starts at 11 a.m. on
Cunningham Field this Saturday.

Women's tennis
The Swarthmore women's tennis team competed in
the ITA Southeast Regional tournament this past
weekend, hosted by Mary Washington College. The
doubles team of senior Anjani Reddy 'O4 and Sonya
Reynolds 'O7 earned a second-place finish in the division, the highest place in the tournament held by any

member. Seeded third in the tournament, the Garnet
duo earned its spot in the finals with an 8-4 victory
over their Washington College opponents. In the
championship match, the Tide fell to second-seed
Washington and Lee, 8-4.
In the singles matchups, Caroline Celano 'O4
advanced to the quarterfinal round, where she fell to

Washington College's Ne'Ko Browder. Veterans Reddy
and Kristina Pao 'O4 lost in the round of 16 in the singles bracket. The women are scheduled to attend the

Sports, cheesesteaks and The Family Guy'

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY ALEX RYAN-BOND
aryanbol@swarthmore.edu

If you've been by the Lamb-Miller Field
House this year, odds are you've run into
Larry. If you've needed cleats, a sweatshirt, socks, you name it, you've probably
met Larry. And, for those of you who
haven't, he's the big, affable guy with the
goatee in the equipment cage. So go and
say hello, but only if you've got a half hour
free. Otherwise, you'll have trouble getting
yourself out of an interesting conversation.
I recently sat down with Larry Yanelli
after his first month here at Swarthmore
working as an equipment manager with
longtime friend and Swarthmore institution Ray Scott. I found out not only where
to get the best cheesesteaks in town but
that some of the most interesting stories
come from outside of Swarthmore.
Alex Ryan-Bond: So, let's start with the

basics. How have your first several
weeks here been?
It's been great. Everyone is terrific. I
mean, it really helps a lot when everyone
is nice, and, when you don't know something around here, you don't feel weird
about asking people because everyone is
so helpful, so it's really been great so far.
You just came here from Widener, which
is a very different school. How different
is it here, and would you say it's better

or worse?

Well, at Widener, it was pretty much
the football team, and the rest of the teams
weren't all that super. But I wouldn't say
it's any better or worse. The kids are having fun, and, in the end, you're here to get
an education, not play sports, and the fact
that the kids here are having fun is great.

Do you miss the football on Saturdays?
Yeah, I miss it, but if I'm off on a
Saturday I can always run over to Widener,

because they're my alma mater too. So I
can go over there and watch it if I'm off, or
listen to it on the radio, but only when I
know nobody else is around
because I
but nobody
am supposed to be working
needs to know that.

Now for the tough questions; where can
I get the best cheesesteaks in town?
I'd have to say Liberty Tavern has the
best. Get there whenever you can.
What's your favorite cartoon?
Most definitely "The Family

Guy."

Stewie is hilarious. I don't know why they
ever took that show off the air. It's probably
one of the funniest shows ever, and I still
watch it on Cartoon Network when I can.
Which cartoon comes in second?
Simpsons, easy. It's a classic.
What are the best stories about Chester

and Philadelphia that nobody knows?
Well, there are plenty, but there are tons
of people around this place that you'll just

run into. The other day, my buddy was
driving through an old neighborhood and
decides to stop by a convenience store and
grab a six pack for old times' sake. When
he walks in, a guy asks him to spare five
bucks, and it's none other than Smokin'
Bert Cooper, who's from around here and
was one punch away from becoming heavyweight

of the world before

Evander Holyfield knocked him out in the
ninth round. Another buddy of mine saw
him at a free hot dog night at a bar, too, and
said he saw Smokin' Bert run out with all
the hot dogs. But he's a nice guy, just having some hard times.

Ray Scott: Yeah, Smokin' Bert used to

come down here and work out a couple of
years ago, and he was always talking about
getting a second shot. He was down here all
the time. He's a great guy. He'll pull himself
together.

Last question. What's the hardest part of
your job? Dealing with kids like Carlton
Davis?
The kids here are great. I have no complaints about them, and it's most of the reason I like my job here.

Women's soccer loses 3-0 to two Centennial Conference teams
BY REUBEN HEYMAN-KANTOR
rheymanl@Swarthmore.edu
The Swarthmore women's soccer team now faces adversity for

the first time this season. Last
week, the Garnet Tide (5-5, 1-2)
were riding high after winning
their Centennial Conference opening match 1-0 over powerhouse
Franklin & Marshall. This week,
the team left wondering how to
move on after a pair of 3-0 defeats
to Gettysburg and Muhlenburg .
Last Saturday, Swarthmore
faced last season's conference runners-up Gettysburg (5-3, 2-0). In the
very early going, the Garnet Tide
were able to control the pace of the
game. "Play was a little sluggish to
start, but combinations were
occurring. The forwards were
finding some nice seams up top
but we weren't quite able to find
the right passes," coach Amy
Brunner said.
But, in the 11th minute of play,
a cross from the left side by
Gettysburg sophomore Kristin
Igusky dropped behind the
Swarthmore defense. Junior
Maggie Cirrito made a back post
run and knocked the ball in the
net for the Bullets first shot and
goal of the day. While the
Swarthmore defense stiffened
and did not allow another goal

the rest of the half, the team as a

whole was unable to match
Gettysburg's play as it had in the
early goings. "We were dominating before the goal, but, after
that, it seemed like we gave up,"
Natalie Negrey 'O7 said. "Our
passes weren't on. We couldn't
play to feet. We kept on losing the
ball to the other team."
The Garnet Tide came out in

the second half with renewed
energy and enthusiasm and were
once again able to control the midfield. Midfielders Tanya Hahnel
'O5 and Sarah Hobbs 'O6 were both
able to get off quality shots, but
Swarthmore continued to be
unable to find the back of the net.
In the midday heat, the Garnet
Tide slowly lost momentum. In
the 62nd minute, a cross from

Cirrito found junior

Jenny

Line.

The forward gave Gettysburg a 2-0
lead when her header went over
the
hands of Swarthmore's
onrushing goalkeeper Catherine
Salussolia 'O4. The Bullets were
able to tack on an insurance goal
in the 77th minute on a breakaway as Swarthmore desperately
pushed forward to get back in the
game.
Overall, Gettysburg outshot the
Garnet Tide 15-7. "We weren't playing with as high intensity as we
were in the past. We got scored on

really early, and that definitely got

us down. It was hard to recover
from that. It set a bad tone for the

rest of the game," lamented forward Stephanie Chapell 'O5.
On Tuesday, Swarthmore traveled to Allentown, Pa., to take on
Muhlenburg (6-3-1, 2-1). The Mules
opened the scoring in the 24th
minute of the game on a goal by
Courtney
Levine.

Swarthmore was able to keep the
score 1-0 until the 78th minute,

Cross country chews up Salisbury
BY AMY STOCKER

astockel@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore cross, country teams showed on
Saturday that they are a powerful force in the running
world. Both teams achieved terrific results in the 8k
and 6k races that included schools from all three
NCAA Divisions.
The Swarthmore men captured first place, besting
the men's Haverford B team by 14 points. Swat's top
finishers included Lang Reynolds 'O5 (26:21), James
Golden 'O5 (26:27) and Garrett Ash 'O5 (26:58), who finished second, third and eighth respectively. Also at
the top of the field were sophomores Adam Hunt,
Keefe Keeley, and Jim Kreft.
"Two components are creating the results that we
are seeing this year," coach Pete Carroll said. "One
component is the top three who are developing into
really strong runners [Golden, Ash, and Reynolds]
and the second component is the sophomores who
trained extremely hard over the summer [Hunt,
Keeley, and Kreft]
this bunch has just made leaps
this season- making a huge difference for the team.
These six runners create two packs which are key to
winning races."
Running in packs is also a key aspect of the
women's team. "Running together in packs really lets
us push each other," said Elizabeth Gardner 'O5.
That extra push between teammates was what
earned the Swarthmore women's cross country team
a great fourth place finish at the Salisbury Invite on
Saturday. Although the team placed fourth, it did earn
the top finish among the Div. 11l schools present at the
meet.
The top women finishers for Swarthmore included
Debbie Farrelly 'O6 who placed 10th (23:30), and
Elizabeth Gardner 'O4, Lauren Fety 'O6 and Caroline
Ritter 'O6, all of whom ran together to claim the 16th,
17th and 18th spots on the course.
Overall, coach Carroll said he thought the
women's team "ran solid." He said that "Elizabeth
and Lauren really ran well together which did a lot
for the team, and Debbie did a terrific job placing in

the top 10 to help earn us our finish." The team, however, was missing its lead runner Maria Elena
Young 'O4 due to a minor injury, which was said to
be a noticeable hole in the team's dynamics on

Saturday.
"Whenever a runner is missing from a meet, it is
noticeable, because everyone is a vital part of the
team, whether or not it changes the team's results I
don't know but an absence does make a huge difference," Gardner said.
The team said the course was the fact that the
course was relatively flat and therefore made the
run times considerably faster. "I feel like we have an
edge on some courses because our home course is
not flat and we are used to running hills," Gardner
said.
The weather was also a factor that both teams had
to overcome on Saturday. Gardner said that "the heat
and humidity were problems, at least for me, this
weekend." But that did not stop the Swat runners.
Coach Carroll reflected on the conditions of the
race. "Although the times were slower than expected
for such a fast course, the teams pushed through the
humidity and pulled out the finishes we wanted," he

said.

Once again, the Swarthmore runners stressed the
importance that training has had in the results that
they are achieving. Farrelly is just one of the many

Swat runners that have a great appreciation for the
training they have undergone.
"I think our success can be attributed mostly to
the consistency and solidity of our training," she
said. "We have built a very strong base over the past
few months of training that is facilitating the success
we're experiencing now."
The men's and women's teams are now concentrating on the next meet this weekend at Dickinson.
This meet is an important one for both teams, since
it is the course that will host the regional meet Nov.
15. The runners, as well as coach Carroll, are hopeful
that the experience from this upcoming Invite will
ultimately lead to success at the Mid-East Regional
competition.

yourselves to
the fact your team sucks this
year. Don't worry. I can sympathize. I'm a diehard Orioles fan.
I've been feeling that way for five years in a row now. And just as
I began building up real hope for next year, we fired our manager on Monday! Talk about letdowns. Grover is one of the best.
Before I get to the topic at hand for this column, previewing
this weekend's Eagles-Redskins game, let me first discuss some
accusations that have been flung my way over the past couple
weeks. I have been accused of "spewing idiotic vitriol" and making up characters in my column. I have been accused of writing
a "stupid column" that was "just dumb and not funny." I have
been accused of being a typical Swarthmore athlete and destroying the "vision" that was supposedly given to our athletic department several years ago, give me a break. Someone has even
accused me of being handsome! To all of these people I have just
one thing to say: You all have no clue (except that last person).
Take a lesson from Jeremy Shockey's recent actions and keep
your mouth shut. If you don'tknow what I'm writing about, then
I'd suggest you not try to criticize me only to look like a fool yourself. If you think I'm being inconsiderate and offensive, I don't
care. Feel free to take it up with me personally.
Now, back to the game. My Redskins are 3-1 and atop the NFC
East. After two abysmal performances, the Eagles have climbed
to 1-2. This weekend is a huge divisional matchup for both teams,
as the Eagles find out whether or not they can overcome a poor
start and the Redskins, already 0-1 in the division, look to expand
their lead over the (shocker!) Cowboys and Giants.
The Eagles defense, though severely beaten up, presents a
challenge to even the highest-powered offenses. The Redskins are
no different. Though they seem to score whenever necessary,
they also seem to lose important divisional games year in and
year out. After questionable play calling by the ball coach nearly
cost the Redskins their last two games, look for the 'Skins to try
to put the Eagles away if they gain the lead.
Donovan McNabb has caused problems for the Redskins ever
since he left Syracuse. The Redskins often fare miserably against
mobile quarterbacks, and McNabb, though he has looked terrible
this year, has been a dagger in the hearts ofRedskins fans for too
long. Trust me when I say you can throw the records out the window this week. If there were ever a must-win in week five, this is
it for both teams. The intensity will be high, the game will be
close, and the play will be physical.
One question. If the Eagles were so excited to have left
Veterans Stadium, why have they lost their first two at Lincoln
Financial Field? Maybe because the stadium has already garnered the stupid nickname "The Line." Which reminds me of a
conversation I had yesterday.
Flip: "Yo, C, you coming to the house to watch football

Me: "Will your sister be there? She's pretty hot."
Flip: "I will break you."
Me: "I'd love to, but I'm going to the Line."
Flip: "The sink? What the heU is the sink?"
Me: "No, the Line."
Flip: "The rink? The Flyers season hasn't started yet."
Finally I just told him Lincoln Financial Field. The name
sucks about as much as France (Flip agrees). At least when I say
FedEx Field, people know what the hell I'm talking about.
At any rate, go Redskins.

Quotable quotes
A few weeks ago, my esteemed colleague Mr. Aaron
Wasserman wrote a witty and insightful column regarding baseball's system of recorded scorekeeping. I must
confess that like Mr. Wasserman, I too am an avowed scoring junkie. Perhaps the only difference between myself
and Mr. Wasserman in this regard is that while we have
both attended no hitters, I was wise enough to score mine,
and thus I have a souvenir of the greatest pitching performance I have ever witnessed. Regardless, Mr.
Wasserman's column was a sharp and discerning look at
baseball's hidden language.
Baseball, however, has

been

represented

quite

well in our own language.
Here I am referring to
baseball's wide and weird
world of quotes and dictums. Witness the name of
my column, 90% Half
Mental. This item comes

from baseball's foremost
linguist, a Mr. Peter

BEN WHARTON

90% Half Mental

Lawrence "Yogi" Berra,
who said that "baseball is
90% half mental." Either
that or he said, "Baseball
is 90% mental, and the
other half is physical." Or
maybe he said neither. Or
both. You get the picture.
Reams and reams of prose
have been spent on Berra's

poetry, so I'll only mention a few of the more obscure
gems. "He hits from both sides of the plate. He's amphibious." "It ain't the heat, it's the humility." And perhaps my
favorite, "Nobody goes there anymore because it's too

crowded."

But there is a world beyond Berra. In the limited space
of this column, I'll mention a few of the more lucid
authors and their most praiseworthy cultural contributions. After Berra. Casey Stengel is most notable for his
own turns of phrase. Stengel, considered one of the greatest managers in history, won seven World Series, yet he

had the misfortune of managing the worst team ever, the
expansion 1962 Mets. His quotes range the wide gulf in
between. "The secret of managing is to keep the guys who

hate you away from the guys who are undecided."
Speaking to outfielder Bob Cerv, "Nobody knows this
[yet], but one of us has just been traded to Kansas City."
And there are quite a few from his Mets days. "No, even
my players aren't players." "You have to have a catcher
because if you don't you're likely to have a lot of passed
balls." "We've got to learn to stay out of triple plays." And
the greatest rhetorical question in all of baseball history,
"Can't anybody here play this game?"
If you're looking for ludicrous malapropisms and a
genuine sense of the ridiculous, longtime San Diego
Padres announcer Jerry Coleman is your man. Foremost
in his art is the classic Dave Winfield call: "Winfield goes
back to the wall. He hits his head on the wall
and it rolls
off! It's rolling all the way back to second base! This is a
terrible thing for the Padres!" If that wasn't bad enough he
also said, "If Rose's streak was still intact, with that single
to left, the fans would be throwing babies out of the upper
deck," along with, "Hats off to drug abusers everywhere."
Many of Coleman's quotes show a unique ability to get lost
in a game that indeed has its share of dead ends and bottomless pits. "The first pitch to Tucker Ashford is ground-
