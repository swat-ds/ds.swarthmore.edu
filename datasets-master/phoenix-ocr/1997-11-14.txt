of the week

Last Sunday marked the beginning ofSurvivors' Week, a six-day series of events and
exhibits intended to promote awareness and
support for survivors of sexual assault. According to Samira Mehta 'OO who worked
with Hillary Thompson '99 to coordinate the
week's activities, "a survivor is anyone who
has survived an experience of rape, sexual
assault, incest, domestic violence, or violence
against homosexuals. The word 'survivor'
is used rather than 'victim' because the latter word connotes helplessness, rather than
someone who is coping with their experience."
Mehta went on to explain that "the primary
purpose of Survivors' Week is to raise awareness, while the secondary purpose is to show
support for survivors. I say that awareness
is the main objective because an aware community is often a supportive community."
She hoped that the week would increase consciousness of sexual violence on campus and
help people understand how they can react
appropriately to it. "We want people to understand that there's more to being supportive than just wearing a yellow ribbon [a symbol that shows support for survivors]," asserted Mehta. "We need to let them know
what the issues are [regarding sexual violence]."
Survivors' Week opened with a display of
approximately thirty t-shirts hanging from a
clothesline in Parrish Parlors. The shirts were
made by friends and relatives of survivors,
as well as by survivors themselves. "It's important to remember that each of these t-shirts
stands for an individual," emphasized Mehta.
Indeed, the messages painted on the t-shirts
serve as powerful reminders that sexual violence is an issue that pervades even the "safe"
community of Swarfhmore. At Monday's
meeting of All Women Over Lunch, Assistant Dean and Gender Education Advisor
Karen Henry spoke about what the College
does to provide support services for survivors and help prevent occurrences of sexual
assault, adding that it is difficult to know
exactly how many survivors there are on
campus: although Henry herself helps many
students with issues ranging from sexual violence to "uncomfortable" feelings about a
sexual incident, she said that there are still

The Swarthmore Human Relations
Department has expanded its efforts
to attract women and minorities for
two open Public Safety positions,
Human Relations director Barbara
Carroll said yesterday.
Public Safety has been left without
any women or minorities on its patrol staff since the resignation ofOfficer Kelly Dodson on September 15.

Department is seeking to fill, along
with a corporal's position that has
been open since this June.
Human Relations began the applicant search for the first of the public
safety jobs this summer. The standard
search procedure for officers' jobs,
according to Carroll, entails advertising in local newspapers such as the
Philadelphia Inquirer and the Delaware County Daily Times as well as

Last Sunday Budget Committee voted to
prohibit Phoenix Editors-in-Chief Arun
Mohan 'OO and George Balgobin 'OO from
entering the student publications office,
where The Phoenix is produced, for one
week. The recommendation came after Student Publications Coordinator Sam
Schulhofer-Wohl reported to BC that the
two had failed to properly lock the door to
the publications office for a second time
this semester. On Monday, in violation of
the BC decision, Balgobin tried to make
his way into the office, only to find both
Jones and Schulhofer-Wohl awaiting him.
The latter summoned a public safety officer to remove Balgobin after he refused
to leave. On Tuesday, Budget Committee
voted to temporarily reverse the prohibi-

tion until this Sunday.
The dispute has its origins in the first
week of the semester, when SchulhoferWohl first discovered that the door to the
office had not been locked sufficiently. He
subsequently emailed both editors-in-chief,
warning them that the entire staff would
lose its right to work in the office for a week
upon a second offense, as is, he stated,
stipulated in rules of the office. Mohan,
Balgobin and Dan Fanaras '99 hold that
they were unaware of these rules until after Schulhofer-Wohl had issued the warning as the rules were first issued via email
three hours after the warning was conferred.
The publications office contains, according to Schulhofer-Wohl and BC treasurer
Vincent Jones '9B, at least $30,000 worth
of equipment. It is secured by three locks

to guard against theft and vandalism,

which, Jones noted, is a perennial concern
on Parrish sth. One lock engages automatically when the door is closed. A second is
a combination lock that is operable without a key. The third is an alarm set by a
key. The office therefore cannot be left
unlocked unless the door is left ajar, which
is not in dispute. Schulhofer-Wohl, who is
responsible for the equipment, has said that
the first lock is flimsy and not an adequate
safeguard. The second lock does not require a key and can be locked by anyone
from the outside without a key. The third
(alarm) lock requires a key; one is available from Public Safety and two were provided to The Phoenix by Schulhofer-Wohl
at the beginning of the semester. The Phoenix asked for a third key for Fanaras, but
Schulhofer-Wohl refused, citing as reasons

the fact that the keys could not duplicated
and only be purchased from the alarm
manufacturer at a high cost and also the
large number of publications which share
the office.
On Thursday, October 30th, SchulhoferWohl sent The Phoenix an email to inform
them that he suspected that they had failed
to lock the office again. According to
Schulhofer-Wohl, while the door locked
itself automatically, the deadbolt lock was
not engaged and the alarm was not set.
Balgobin admitted failing to set the alarm,
"simply because I didn't have the key." He
continued saying, "Because we're short on
keys, I had to give my key to Arun earlier.
It was 5:30A.M. when I went to leave, it
was also raining and I live in ML." But he

A letter from
the Editors
We feel the need to clarify the events surrounding this door locking
controversy. Many students initially read about the situation in the Gazette, a piece we feel has many incorrect statements. However, we also
feel that many incidents that we regard as important were not presented
to the public.
Most importantly, we wish to say that the entire situation has been
severely blown out of proportion and that the entire adjudication process
is simply a petty power play.
That said, we never received a copy of the Publication Office rules
before the first warning was issued. The rules were sent post-facto three
hours following the warning, effectively nullifying that warning. To lend
some humanity to this situation filled with words like "unsecured" and
"adjudicated", the first incident occurred during the first week of school
while we were still getting acclimated to our new positions. In that situation, we forgot to secure the alarm and lock the deadbolt. The door
was, however, locked and it was 4:30 a.m. In the second incident, George
Balgobin was alone in the office. He had given his key to Aran Mohan
earlier that evening so that Aran could come up the next day. Aran had
given his key to Dan Fanaras, the publisher, the previous day. So, George
was without the alarm key when he went to leave at 5:30a.m. To dispute
what appeared in the Gazette, George remembers locking the deadbolt,
especially since he was without the alarm key. We were confronted by
the Publications Coordinator the following day and admitted that we had
left the alarm unsecured. George asked him to give us a third key as a
simply and easy solution to the issue. The Publications Coordinator, and
also Gazette editor, responded that "he didn't feel comfortable" giving
The Phoenix a key for each of their management. We offered to pay for
the key when he mentioned it was expensive. No dice.
In contrast to what the Gazette reported, we did respond to the emails
that were sent. While we admit that our responses had a tone of abruptness, we did mention that we were sorry for the situation and that we
would simply like to have a third key to aid in not repeating the mistake.
Which is what is was, a mistake, and not something that needed to be
adjudicated, especially in front of a committee which sets budgets.
The thing that most concerned us was that the situation was immediately perceived by the Publications Coordinator to be one that deserved
punishment. First of all, it was, technically by the rales, our first offense
(recall the rules being sent out after the warning) and it only involved
one of us. Yet we were both suspended. And suspension further indicated
to us how our judges only saw this situation in terms of punishment.
Suspension was not a solution to a problem since ours was not one where
we might have damaged the equipment through use. We felt that the
more appropriate response would be to either give us a third key, or if
they didn't trust us with the keys, take our keys away for a week. Yet
suspension was merely punitive.
However, an entirely unaddressed and important issue was did BC and
the Publications Coordinator, appointed positions and students just like
we, have the power to suspend other students from student space? Well it
certainly wasn't in their charters as we read them. We found the interpretation thatBC had to protect its investments ludicrous, as the same argument could be used to regulate all student groups. While we do see the
need for the Publications coordinator to be able to protect the equipment, he had absolutely no right to prohibit us from entering the office or
from using the machine unless our presence endangered the equipment.
And as all would agree our presence would not affect the equipment. We
do agree that the Publications Coordinator had the right to take away our
keys a more relevant response to not alarming the door, he certainly had
no reason to suspend us.
Regardless there must be a check on the Publication Coordinator's
power. His decisions must be made by him, not by Budget Committee,
as they are not fit to serve as a judicial body, and must be directly appealable to Student Council.
The rest is just bickering. Everything, in fact, is just bickering. We
made a mistake, we're sorry as we've said before, and we wish the whole
situation would settle down a few degrees as Bob Gross said. We're just
students, I guess sometimes things just get a bit carried away.

Classroom use in Kohlberg

If I were indeed the Space Czar,

be able to eliminatefrom this campus by stern aspect and royal decree the problem of two bodies
attempting to occupy the same

'space', it often falls to me to juggle
conflicting needs.
Some students are using classrooms as study space in the
evening. The problem arises when
that classroom has been reserved,
and the reserving group arrives to
find the room occupied. Of course
the 'squatters' have to leave, but the
situation is uncomfortable for everyone.

of events and student group meetings, and most Kohlberg classrooms
are reserved most weeknight evenings.

"Polish Concentration Camp"
is a misnomer
To the Editor:
Last week, a reproduction of one
of the photographs from the Genocide exhibit, GLuckmann's photo
of the beds at Birkenau, was labeled
as the photo of beds in a "Polish
Concentration Camp." This caption
is, in some ways, correct. The beds
are part of a concentration camp
which is now in Poland. Labeling
it as a "Polish concentration camp",
however, is not only wrong but also
insulting. There were no Polish
concentration camps during the
second world war. As a matter of
fact, there was no Polish state in
existence during this time. The concentration camp in question,
Auschwitz-Birkenau, carries a German name because it was built by
the German state even though it
stands on what is now Polish terri-

tory. The mis-identification of the
crimes of German Fascism with the
Polish state and people has led to
much unneeded animosity between
Jewish and Polish organizations and
people throughout the world. The
Jews and the Poles have plenty of
problems to sort out, and little mistakes such as last week's aggravate
the already sad state of affairs. I am
not trying to absolve all Poles ofany
responsibility for anti-semitism; but
never has a Polish organization
committed crimes comparable to
the Nazi death camps, makes me
sad that in the weekly paper of a college such ours this distinction can
go unnoticed.

Commentary on Cabaret
To the Editor:
The lack of diverse leisure
events on campus makes me
grateful for Cabaret, where dancing, performance, and drinking is
served from a different angle.
Some avenue to walk that isn't the
generic pleasure scene. So, I liked
the atmosphere. The problem?
The content. Two women who
can talk only about having sex and
are turned on by guys referring to
them all the time as sex objects
and actually make efforts to put
themselves in the sex object role.
The four guys are seen as wanting sex too, but generally take a
more condescending attitude toward women and can talk about
things besides sex with each
otherâ€”uh, even if it's limited. I
don't think I saw one scene where
Emily or Anne ever talked to each
other about a subject outside of
sex. Emily came out of the role
of stupid girl or sexually obsessed
female once or twice. At the end
of the play when she turns out to
have been the detective of the
crime and then when giving advice to Anne Frickeâ€”the ever obsessed sex childâ€”Emily mentions that perhaps Anne's obsession is a problem. Umm, pretty

lame, yo. I understand that the
play was supposed to be a spoof,
but solely sex, and therole choice,
has been very overused. I was
hoping that Swarthmore people
would have material outside of
sex to contribute to a play, so that
people could laugh at something
new, andâ€”in terms of its presentationâ€”less demeaning. It's kind
of the equivalent of mean jokes.
Yeah, they can be really funny, but
they hurt other people. If you're
really skilled you can work with
limited material and make really
funny jokes that don't hurt people.
I wonder whether these particular writers would have been able
to create humour with more limited materials and really showed
off a degree of skill. It's not hard
when you're building off the overused.

question, I was agreeing with the initial
comments made about the bubble of

Swarthmore College in which we all live.
I was completely thrown when it lead to
a discussion about racism on campus. I
knew then that this campus has reached
an insane level of paranoia.
The problem here at Swarthmore is that
everyone lives in their own little world and
when they leave that world to enter thereal
one, they are in for a great shock. In fact, I
feel that many people at this school are
learning how to not function in society. Yes,
racism is a problem a world problem. I
am not denying that it exists, but so does
sexism and so many other types ofdiscrimination. The problem comes when people
let themselves feel self-conscious about
their differences and look at the world
through a defective lens, reading issues into
situations which are simply not there. I feel
that this may be what has happened in this
particular case.
I feel that the woman who feels offended
by the events of the evening shouldreevaluate the situation and even speak to theother
participants as I feel that they have been
wrongfully accused of having racially motivated actions. I saw no evidence of any
tension, but instead Swarthmore students
enjoying themselves, and no one was certainly thinking or caring about what would
happen if an African-American women
would win and have to go on a date with a
Caucasian male. It is not fair to speak about
the beliefs and motivations of others when
the accuser is not familiar with those being accused. It is also unfair to make generalizations about the students of
Swarthmore College based on unsubstantiated events such as those expressed by
the woman who feels offended. I am sorry
that the woman felt that the environment
to which she was subjected was one
unsupporting of diversity, and I would hate
to feel that way myself, but as a witness, I
really do not see evidence to support her
claims.
In short, I think that the students of
Swarthmore need to stop pointing fingers
at everyone else and takeresponsibility for
themselves and their beliefs. Minor incidents are constantly being made into the
bigger issues that they are not. This happens so often that I have never felt comfortable on this campus as my actions or
verbalizations may unintentionally offend
someone. Diversity and equality do not
exist as long as people are not allowed to
hold opinions that differfrom another's. I
do not attend the school that I thought I
was coming to three years ago. It is truly
sad that last week's article needed to be
written.

Paranoia

pervades life at
Swat

A3

By Anne Frankenfield

I am writing in response to the recent
Phoenix article which read racism into the
Singled Out event held last weekend on
campus. I was not only an audience member, but a participant as well and I think
the writer of the article and I were at two
differentfunctions. Personally, I think that
the event was one of the healthiest and most
fun events on this campus in a long time.
Everyone there was having a good time at
the expense of no one except themselves,
and everyone involved in the game itself
was the victim of stares. I myself was relieved when I was eliminated from the pool
of women as I dreaded being one of the

three left to be gawked at by all. All of
the women who made it to the finals
were stared at. They were the center of
attention. They were not being singled
out (excuse the pun) because they differed in skin color, gender (as in the case
of the one male remaining), or sexual
preference. If I had been one of the three,
I probably would have been self-conscious and felt as if everyone were staring only at me as well. This would not
have been because I have blond hair, blue
eyes, and was wearing a white shirt and
jeans. It's called nerves, not racism. In
fact, when I began reading the article in

Prop 209 a step
toward equality
By Charles Fischette
Voltaire once said, "I disagree with everything you say, but I will defend to the death
your right to say it." In typical fashion, the
ideologs of the Left have lambasted the citizens of California for exercising their right
to choose the government of their state. By
stating, as an article in this newspaper did
last week, that Californians were not aware
for what they were voting in passing Proposition 209, the liberal community again
shows theirtrue disdain for the workings of
democratic America and again asserts that,
far from being the party of the majority, they
will stop at nothing to subvert the will of the
people when it contradicts their agenda.
Proposition 209 effectively ended affirmative action in California by the state for use
in university admission and the like. Far from
deploring this, we should take is as a movement away from the racial impasse of the
twentieth century and as a beacon of hope
for all those who truly desire to live in an
America where "all men are created equal."
Yet, as always, the Left views the vote of
the people ofCalifornia as grounded in ignorance andracism and contrary to the spirit
ofequality. In so doing, we shouldall finally
come to realize the true motivations of the
Left and why America has, after so long, finally escaped from the terrible rhetoric of
quotas and preferences and come into the
belief in a new America.
We can see so clearly here that the Left
has no affinity for the will of the people. If
they did, they would not have challenged
Proposition 209 in federal court. Instead, the
Left, as always, considers the people as inherently ignorant and stupid and believes, to
which numerous examples will attest, that
only it has the ability to lead America, not
by convincing America, but by undermining the freedom that it professes to defend.
Anyone with a "Mac" or "Mc" will certainly have relatives that can remember a
time when they were beaten down in the
streets of the east coast. Now they are those
same cities' mayors. By the tool of affirmative action, we are prohibiting this transformation to happen for an entire generation
and race ofAmericans. Affirmative action not
only discourages whites from the cause ofblack
America, but underminesthe ability ofblack
America to achieve parity with society.

As the case of California will attest to, the
silent majority of America no longer favors
affirmative action. They perceive it as a system of discrimination again them that unfairly punishes them for, in essence, being
in the majority. They have had enough, not
only of less qualified people taking their
place, but also of the University ofCalifornia rejecting the applications of Asian students because they had already met their
quota. They have had enough of politicians
preaching freedom and instilling prejudice.
That have had enough, and they acted.
The people of California new well what
they did on November 4. They signaled an
end to an idea whose time both passed and
never was. Nothing has done more to widening the racial gulf in America than affirmative action, and the people ofCalifornia
knew it. Far be it from anyone to accuse
someone of ignorance when their opinion
disagrees with theirs. That, friends, is the
essence of speech we at Swarthmore profess to decry.
And the non-caucasian population ofCalifornia had had enough of the government
telling them that they could never be as good
as white people on their own. This is the true
and sad core ofaffirmative action. Its belief,
as is that of liberal government always, is
that people, in and of themselves, do not have
the capacity to overcome the bigotry and
ignorance ofindividuals and that whites can
never move beyond theirhistorical prejudices
and into a beliefof true equality.
I do not believe, nor can anyone of sound
mind, the America is now a place of racial
equality. I cannot now say that blacks and
whites, women and men, Jews and Christians, are now equal in the eyes of the people
of America. I, with all ofyou, wish for that
day to come. But by allying whites against
blacks, by promoting the belief that blacks
cannot hope to achieve the same things as
whites without help, and by condemning
democracy, we do not promote that goal.
Proposition 209 is the first step in what will
certainly be a long road to equality for all. I
hope to see an America in which we are all
judged, not by the color of our skin, but by
the content of our character. By eliminating
affirmative action, we have taken such a step.
'Let no one convince us otherwise.

Publications: casting for the real story
You've seen the signs in Parrish. You've read the
long-winded article in the Daily Gazette. You've read
the articles and editorials in this very issue of the Phoenix. But there's still something missing. An event of
such drama, passion, and intrigue as the past week's
Phoenix/Daily Gazette/Vincent and Sam conflict is
dying to make it onto film. That's why I'm so pleased
to announce to everyone that the story has now been
optioned for a movie to be released in the Summer of
'99, courtesy of Producer Jerry Bruckheimer (of Con
Air and The Rock fame) and Universal Pictures.
Initial development is now underway. This reporter
is so excited at the prospect that he cannot resist giving his own casting suggestions. So peruse the following list and if you disagree or have other ideas, by
all means write into the Phoenix and let us know your
picks!
George Balgobin The crusading editor-in-chief
determined to reveal the truth. The semi-deranged lunatic apt to irrational behavior and outrageous outbursts. Seemingly calm, but always something deep
and foreboding going on beneath those eyes. Who else
but the man who played the crusading editor who
-

mouthed off to the powers-that-be in The Paper and
seemed normal but had another side to his personality
that was totally psychotic in Batman could take on
this challenging role? Get me Michael Keaton on the
phone!
Sam Schulhofer-Wohl Hero to some, arch-enemy
to others. For a role as complex in this where some
members of the audience are sure to hate him and others to love him, we need an actor as comfortable playing the righteous man in charge as the supervillain on
his own insane power quest. Perhaps a man who has
played a quiet hero in Hoosiers, a supervillain in Superman, and, most appropriately, the man in charge
of a nuclear submarine who believes he is on a righteous quest but comes into conflict with the young
upstart below him in the chain or command in Crimson Tide? Let's find a curly hairpiece for Gene Hackman.
Vincent Jones Given thepaucity ofAfrican-American actors in Hollywood, let alone those who can take
on the role of possibly the biggest personality on a
campus of 1400 people who think they deserve the
spotlight, this is a difficult role to cast. Mesach Tay-

-

lor, late of Designing Women, bears more than a passing resemblance, but has never had a role this big. The
most logical choice at this point, however, would
have to be Ving Rhames. Anybody about to appear
on HBO as Don King, possibly the biggest personality in the country, can certainly handle a role
of such a powerful and self-righteous campus
leader.
Dan Fanaras An innocent just trying to do his job
and caught up by circumstances beyond his control.
A man pushed to the edge by the insanity that surrounds him, almost forced to quit rather than snap. He
doesn't seem to be an activist taking sides in a battle,
but can't stand to see injustice. Having done nothing
wrong in the situation, he remains in his position to
hold the newspaper together. If The Phoenix conflict
is a train wreck (and who can doubt that it is?), then
Mr. Fanaras is surely most appropriately played by
someone with experience playing a meek man turned
into a Fugitive, Harrison Ford.
Bob Gross The dean of students with the power to
end it all, should he so choose. Is he on the side of
right or wrong? Will he exercise his powers? It must

be somebody who is immediately recognizable, with
a lot of experience in a supporting role as the administrator holding back the warring parties, and someone
comfortable wearing a beret. Although it is not totally
loyal to the source material, let's see if we can't get
James Earl Jones on board for this one. (Note to script:
Let's work in a scene of Bob alone where he deals
with the stress of the situation by repeating to himself
"No matter you say or do, I am still a worthwhile person")
Of course there will be smaller roles, such as the
quiet sidekickArun Mohan (I say we cast an unknown
for this quirky role), Associate Dean Ted Goundie
(what's Jeff Goldblurn's asking price these days?), the
mysterious figures cloaked in shadows who create the
signs that go up Parrish (perhaps the guy who played
DarkmanT), and Al Bloom, the pleasant college president trying to stay above it all (will Mel Brooks act in
a film he doesn't direct?).
Attach the trailer to the new James Bond flick and
advertise heavily in college markets and this is sure to
be the disturbing yet comedic hit thriller of the summer of 1999!

Let's put some effort into diversity
By Kristin Chadderton
One night last week, I set my alarm
clock to play the radio when it went off.
I woke up the next morning to a song on
a Philadelphia pop music station. I liked
the song, but began thinking that I ought
to reset the radio to WFLN 95.7,
Philadelphia's classical music station.
Because I've been an 'FLN listener for
several years and usually set my alarm
to that station, I wondered why I hadn't
already done that. It wasn't until I woke
up more fully that I remembered that this
fall, WFLN was replaced by a pop music station because it wasn't earning a
sufficient profit. Although I'd known
about this event since it happened, it was
only when I discovered that I couldn't
set my alarm to that station any more that
I realized its implications.
Like other Philadelphian classical supporters, I was shocked and disturbed
when I learned about 'FLN's closing. I
followed the stories in the papers, reading angry letters to the editor from both
classical and jazz fans about the Temple
University public radio station, 90.1, formerly an all-jazz station and now also
broadcasting classical music in an effort
to replace 'FLN. Many classical supporters felt that our music was being forgotten by a society that was streamlin-

ing itself for profit and ignoring diversity.
At the time, I wouldn't have been the
person to ask to draw objective conclusions about the closing of 'FLN. I was
caught up in the conflicts and reacting
more on the basis of emotion than reason. But my experience last week has
made me think further and realize that
the issue is, in fact, about more than
classical musicâ€”it's an issue that is relevant to everyone.
When we talk about diversity in general, we all tend to accept this idea, but
do we understand what it means? If we
do not allow for diversity, we reduce opportunities for development and fall into
a pattern of uniformity, with only one
set of ideas to which we all subscribe.
I don't think we are deliberately trying to create an environment of this kind.
The problem is the fact that to create a
diverse society, more effort is required
than many people are willing to give. In
the example of WFLN, a publicly-supported station, it would have taken more
than only classical supporters to provide
enough funds for the station to operate
at a profit. Other listeners not as interested in classical music would also have
needed to donate their efforts. But how
often are we willing to step beyond what
we are accustomed to and support another cause'or culture that we aren't fa-

miliar with? Speaking from my own experience, the easiest route is to do
what I enjoy and not worry about Ml&
other pursuits that don't interest
me. I believe this is an attitude that
many people share, and because of â– 
it, we see an increasingly uniform â– 
society in which the will of the ma- 1
jority is supported because it is the 1
easiest to support, but other ideas are
allowed to be forgotten. I think in order to save the diversity of society as a
whole, we must all go outside our experience and be exposed to new things.
Again, I think we all agree with this idea
in principle, but how often do we do it
in practice?
As I was thinking about my own reaction to the 'FLN situation, I began wondering why classical music is so important to me. As a child I often found it
boring; I was more interested in pop
music. Then I remembered one of the
first lessons I had with a piano teacher
with whom I studied for several years.
He asked what kind of music I liked; I
told him jazz and popular. He taught me
only classical music, because it was a
large gap in my experience and he knew
that filling that gap would add a valuable aspect to my life.
with. We all agree to this in principle,
In order to keep the kind of society that but at times the effort required is more
benefits all of us, we need to be willing than we want to give. I think that if we
to learn about what we aren't familiar do not make that effort, we will lose

many opportunities for learning and
broadening our experience. I think the
closing of 'FLN is not only an issue for
classical music fans, but a warning to all
of us that unless we work to maintain it,
the diversity of our society will be lost.

BC to make decision regarding DuPont projectors
By

Drew Mast

At the Budget Committee meeting last week, the decision on a
proposal to replace the movie projectors in Dupont was postponed
until this week's meeting pending
a poll of student support. The proposal, brought by head projectionist Rafi Dowty (and supported by
Movie Committee kingpin Josh
Alloy, and Film Society coordinator lan Bricke) called for the im-

mediate purchase of two new projectors for Dupont. According to
Alloy, the reason for the urgency
is that both of the LPAC projectors are out of commission,
meaning that all movies must
now be shown on the aging
Dupont machines, which are
"old, decrepit, prone to breaking,
and past their prime."
Rather than depleting the General Reserve Fund, which would
potentially cripple funding for

events later this year, the BC decided to make their decision this
coming week after hearing student
opinion on the matter. A workgroup was set up by the BC to independently poll the student body,
and an email was sent out to determine whether students preferred to
foot the bill now or wait until
spring budgeting. The latter option
would mean that the budget could
be adjusted "across the board" to
cover the cost, but, according to BC

Treasurer Vincent Jones, the new
projectors would not arrive until
the beginning of next year. If then,
the current projectors were to break
down this year, new ones would not
be available for at least a month.
Since Sunday's meeting, two
events have occurred that may influence the BC's final decision.
First, because of the resolution of
a Cooper Foundation conflict,
about $ 11,000dollars has become
available to the BC. These funds

These t-shirts have hung in Parrish Parlours during Survivors week. Take
Back the Night, the final event of the week, will be held in the Friends
Meeting House tonight at 8:00.
The evening will conclude with Voices,
a forum in which men and women divide
into single-sex groups to share survivor experiences and to raise concerns about
sexual violence. Mehta felt that the forum
would provide a place where participants
"can speak openly without worrying about
the responses of others. People won't be
told that they should go to Psychiatric Services or that their experiences are invalid."

Voices represents an appropriate finish to
a week aimed at ending the silence that
often surrounds issues of sexual violence.
Added Mehta, "There's a sense of security
at Swarthmore that makes people feel like
[sexual assault] can't happen here.
Survivor's Week is largely meant to make
people aware that it can and does happen
here; in fact, there are survivors on cam-

lege has come under fire by some members of the community for condoning activities like Pub Night, which was started
three or four years ago by the directors of
Paces. Back then, according to Goundie,
Pub Night's emphasis was on conversation
and entertainment, not on drinking. But
when booze became the focus and problems resulted from a prospective student
attending Pub Night and drinking excessively, the Paces directors discontinued the
Thursday night gathering. Since then, Pub

According to Jones, student support has so far been in favor of replacing the Dupont projectors now.
Alloy would like this trend to continue, and says, I truly hope that
the campus votes to buy the projectors now rather than later".

Other events that occurred throughout the
week included WSRN's broadcast of
Stained Glass Windowsâ€”a reading ofpoetry written by survivorsâ€”a mural painting in Clothier Foyer, a poetry reading by
Becka Birtha, and a performance of "Some
Kind of Misunderstanding" by the studentrun Catalyst Theater Company from Johns

Take Back the Night, which will be held
tonight in the Friends Meeting House at

Annapolis Naval Academy, and Gail

about her personal experiences as a survivor and how they influenced her choice of

Night nonetheless has been started up
againâ€”this time under the name Cheersâ€”by the Senior Class officers.
The College has also been criticized for
failing to take action when SAC-funded
parties serve only alcoholic beverages.
While it is SAC policy not to pay openly
for alcohol, student groups have admitted
presenting thecommittee with fake receipts
and, in this roundabout way, purchasing
alcohol with College money. Many students disagree with the policy that does not
allow SAC money to be spent on alcohol.
As Alvarez explains, "If we're all respon-

sible drinkers, why can't SAC funds be
used for alcohol as much as for pretzels?"
However, in the wake of criticism and in
an effort to curb the illegal funding of alcohol, new SAC policy dictates that groups
hosting parties may not present receipts
from any businesses that sell alcoholic beverages.
Goundie, who chairs of the group that
sets College alcohol policy, plans to hold a
meeting before the end of the year to review where the College stands in its attitude towards alcohol and to make improvements to the existing policy.

plained that BC has a responsibility to protect the Student Activities Fund's investment, and that the publications coordinator is charged by BC with safeguarding and
maintaining the equipment in the office.
Mohan and Balgobin also were dismayed
that they were not present at the meeting,
terming the decision to suspend them without their presence "absolutely unacceptable and unprofessional."
Mohan further questioned his suspension, since Balgobin was alone with the
alarm was not set. Both said that
Schulhofer-Wohl's positions as publications coordinator and an editor of The Daily
Gazette could constitute a conflict of interest. Finally, they argued that since the
alarm was left unset for only approximately
four hours there was no "realistic opportunity of theft." Fanaras further noted that
even without the alarm the door was locked
and a thief would have had to pick the lock
or break the door down to gain entry.
On Monday morning Balgobin defied the
suspension and entered the office at 11:30,
as he had indicated to Jones. Jones and
Schulhofer-Wohl were waiting for him,
and Schulhofer-Wohl told him he had to
leave. When Balgobin refused, SchulhoferWohl told him he would call Public Safety
after he counted to 10. When SchulhoferWohl finished counting, he called Public
Safety and spoke to the officer on duty. The
officer called Associate Dean Tedd
Goundie for instructions, as this situation
had never before occurred, according to
Goundie. Goundie asked the officer to ask
Balgobin to leave, and to write a report of
the incident if he did not comply. Balgobin
left after the officer arrived bearing
Goundie's instructions.
Subsequently Goundie spoke with Jones
and Balgobin and suggested that BC consider the situation again with Balgobin and
Mohan present, during the BC meeting
scheduled for this Sunday. Balgobin and
Mohan have stated a desire to appeal to
Student Council, as they feel BC is hostile
towards The Phoenix.. SC is also expected
to consider the matter on Sunday, according to Ari Plost '9B, SC co-chair, who has
been attempting to negotiate a resolution
to this issue.
Recently signs have appeared around
campus which appear to condemn
Schulhofer-Wohl's and Jones' roles in the
incident. Today Goundie condemned these
signs while expressing hope for an early
resolution to this conflict.

contested Schulhofer-Wohl's recollection,
stating that he "definitely locked the
deadbolt."
On October 30th and 31st SchulhoferWohl discussed the matter with Balgobin
and emailed The Phoenix again to inform
them he had checked the records in Ben
West and concluded that The Phoenix was
at fault, and that according to student publications procedures The Phoenix could be
suspended for a week. Schulhofer-Wohl
said in the email that he did not want to
shut down The Phoenix and solicited alternatives from Balgobin and Mohan, suggesting cleaning the office or using the keys
at Ben West as examples. In abrupt reply
Balgobin expressed regret that the office
was not locked and made clear his conviction that Schulhofer-Wohl would not suspend The Phoenix over the incident.
On Sunday November 2nd SchulhoferWohl spoke with Mohan and Balgobin, and
asked for written statements that would
reassure him that they would keep the office secured with all three locks. By
Wednesday neither had replied and
Schulhofer-Wohl wrote again, warning
them that ifthey did not send him the statements, he would "refer the matter to Budon

By Sunday Mohan and Balgobin had not
written the statements, and on Sunday night
Schulhofer-Wohl presented the case to
Budget Committee. As publications coordinator, Schulhofer-Wohl is an employee
of BC and felt that he did not want to take
such a serious step as suspending the
Mohan and Balgobin, especially without
consulting BC. The committee heard
Schulhofer-Wohl's report and voted to
suspend them for one week, effective 9 a.m.
Monday November 10. It was decided that
Public Safety would be called, and Mohan
and Balgobin treated as trespassers, if the
suspension was violated. During the deliberations Josh Kramer abstained due to bias
against The Phoenix. (Editor's note:
Kramer was dismissedfrom his position as
Arts & Leisure editor in late September.)
Informed Sunday night ofBC's decision,
Mohan and Balgobin expressed concerns
about the extent of BC's authority to prevent them from entering a campus space

Redgrave said that "we're committed to
having a diverse department."
He also said that in his twenty-one years
in the Swarthmore Public Safety Department, "though there have been some lapses,
we've always had female patrol officers
since I started here. Which at that time was
really out of the norm."
"The basis of the current recruiting difficulty is that there are not many women in
law enforcement," he explained, adding
that the payscale at Swarthmore put them
at a disadvantage.
"The few qualified females that are in
the system get snapped up by those who
pay more than we do," he said. All state
and municipal police forces offer higher
pay than does Swarthmore, according to
Redgrave.
Some students, including the college

Addressing those concerns, Redgrave
acknowledged the benefits of hiring a female officer, although he stressed the versatility of the department as a whole.
"Certainly some female members of the
community are going to relate better to a
female officer, whatever the issue," said
Redgrave, "but I like to think that our staff
is trained well enough that that wouldn't
be too much of an issue."

Handbook II: The Quickening

The

Swarthmore College Stu
dent Handbook is a nifty

thing. This condensed guide,
much like Cliff's Notes, lays
out, in consistently dry form,
every single administrative tidbit about
the College you could ever want to know.
Should you wake up in the middle of the
night with a burning desire to brush up
on rules and regulations, College services,
or residential life (in case you don't
know) the booklet's your man. What's
more, its aerodynamic design and convenient size make it a handy object to fling
at yourroommate when he decides to play
yet another Al Pacino Quicklime movie.
But for all its strengths, the handbook
is lacking. Published back at the beginning of the semester, it has grown obsolete, brandishing a truckload of explicitly
laid out dos and don 'rs that have simply
fallen out of rune with the needs of today's
frazzled student. So, just as New York's
Mafia kingpin, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,

called for a crack down on "quality of
life" crimes in the city four years ago, I
adamantly proclaim that it's time for some
shaping up around here, as well. Let's
earn our inflated ranking, gosh darn it!
With that said, it is with great fanfare,
and under much fatigue, that I hereby lay
out a proposed set of rules to be included
in the next edition of the handbook
ones that will hopefully improve quality
of life within the Bubble (albeit without
Mafia assistance) and pacify us all that
much more.

A rare treat is the doodle gallery. Curator Wilson Kello has assembled the finest products of distraction south of some

An untold story
aside my nagging doubts and tried to
convince myself that asking anything more
was not important and that I didn't really
want those things. I wanted to know him. I
wanted him to know and like and be impressed by me. What I really wanted was
for him to call for some other reason than
going for a drive. After that first day, I reduced my hopes to just that.
Our first date consisted of him driving
me home from school and hanging out in
my living room. It wasn't long before we
were kissing. It wasn't long after that he
took off my shirt. I'd never removed my
shirt in the presence of a guy before. I still
had my jeans on, but I was cold, and I was
scared. I froze. He laid down. And laid me
down on top of him.
I'd been here before. This was where I
was supposed to start kissing him. I was
hoping for a kiss on the mouth, but that
wasn't coming, so I tried kissing his neck.
After ten minutes he said, "Isn't there
somewhere more comfortable?" He
grabbed me by the hand and took me upstairs to my bedroom. He lay down on my
bed and looked at me, waiting for me to
resume where I left off.
I continued to kiss his chest, but when I
went back up to his neck he said, "Hey!" I
wanted to know what I had done wrong. I
almost panickedâ€”had I hurt him? Had I
shown my ignorance about men? "You're
a tease," he said. "Going down and then

arm that was holding my face and shoulders up lost its strength; my face hit the
pillow three inches from his. I felt his hands
at his

shoulder, the fingers pointing directly down
my back, his thumb just above my clavicle
on my neck. I felt my torso being pushed
down his body. When I got low enough,
he transferred his hands to the top and back
of my head and pushed it into his crotch.
It was dark and scary and hot and uncomfortable and close and confusing. And he said,
"come on, suck on it," and he groaned. He kept
his hand on my head I was only whimpering,
"n0..." and I don't think that he heard me.
The hand didn't move. I didn't feel like I

do. I started to cry and took his penis in
my mouth, hoping that it would be over
soon. It seemed like it took forever. When
I stopped, his hands, still on my head, continued the rhythm, intermittently choking
and teasing me with freedom.
When I think back, the only thing I feel
is hatred for my weakness.

among political thrillers. The audience discovers along with the investigators exactly what the killer's
methods are, and little pieces of
information all come together in a
short, stunning burst of action at the
end of the film for a classic resolution.
Amazingly enough, Caton-Jones

and scriptwriter Chuck Pfarrer
seemingly did not notice these
things about the original film, and
instead decided that the way to remake it was to throw out pacing,
logic, continuity, and characterization, and go straight to lame
'thriller' cliches and recycled plot

elements. The original film is about
an attempt on Charles DeGaulle's
life by a renegade element of the
French army. This movie has

bullshit Russian mobsters as
villians who, of course, want to
knock off some American official
just to teach us Capitalist Pigs a lesson. I'm so tired of watching postCold War Russian mobster bad
guys, I could almost throw up.
Think about it: Air Force One,
Goldeneye, Maximum Risk, First
Strike, The Peacemaker, all weak
movies, with weak, undefined Russian bad guys. During the Cold
War, there was an honest threat, but
now, Russians make pretty crappy
villains.
In this film, we see nothing ofthe
Jackal's methods; he hops around
from one place to the next in disguise, but we never actually get a
sense as to exactly what he's up to
and why. Instead, Caton-Jones and
Pfarrer created the Gere character

(completely not in the first movie)
to allow another 'name' actor to
enter the cast. His character and
performance both stink, too, and
the audience is given no justification as to why we should care about
him or his backstory.
Willis' performance is truly remarkable. Never before has a lead
actor spent such little time on
screen. Most of the time he's just sitting or standing around with that smirk
on his face; he certainly isn't acting.
Someone should have informed

Willis, however, that the movie isn't
a comedy, and his numerous, humorous disguises simply distract
the viewer from the film's plot.
One scene, where the Jackal poses
as a gay man and picks up a guy in
a D.C. nightclub, would be offensive if it weren't so outrageously

Give you

over-the-top.
Technically, the movie is in good
hands. Carter Burwell's score is a

particularly strong element, as is
German cameraman Karl Walter
Lindenlaub's competent photography. The special effects are not incredibly stunning, however, and the
climactic train sequence, which has
some awful visual effects, should
have been edited out in a big way.
In the end, The Jackal serves as a
good reminder that Hollywood
should not attempt to remake great
movies. Hopefully, this film will
get people interested in the original, because it packs quite a punch.
I think Hollywood in general, and
this big-budget remake in particular, couldlearn a simple lesson from
the original The Day of The Jackal:
Less is more.

Ultimate teams unite for coed tourney
commented co-captain of the

By Annie Bacon

This past weekend a team of

Warmothers and Earthworms traveled together to participate in a two

day coed tournament. Although the
weather was gloomy and dark, and
a little bit windy, their spirits were
high. The first game was against a
combination team made up of
iDrexel, Haverford, and Bryn Mawr.
Experimenting with different zone
defenses and playing as a cohesive
team, Swarthmore creamed them,

11-2. Swarthmore lost in the second game to the Purple Trader, 8-13.
In the third game against the Quaker
City All-Stars, (a team which included more than one memberof the
infamous Philly Peppers team),
Swarthmore still managed to score
3 points, and was complemented on
their play after the game. "Saturday

With a downsized team of seven
diehard Frisbee fiends, the
Warworms set off to crush the competition on Sunday. Though somewhat slighted by Sharpies (the apples
were 100% pith, and bagels were
100% invisible), the crusaders managed to muster enough strength to
come out strong. The fields were
wet, but the mist was not heavy
enough to freeze hands or to shorten
throws: perfect weather for bidding.
Their first opponent, Tough Girls

Field hockey captures first ECAC Title
Jean Quinn

The Garnet wrapped up their season last weekend with an impressive pair of victories over Drew and
William Paterson to capture the
ECAC title. This is the first Eastern College Athletic Conference
championship for Swarthmore in
any sport.
The top seed in the tournament,
the Garnet faced the number four
seed Drew whom they had dispatched of easily earlier in the season. The team had no trouble repeating the feat, knocking off the
Rangers 3-0. Jen Hagan '99,
Danielle Duffy '9B, and Donna

Griffin '99 each scored, while
Duffy and Kristin English 'Ol
notched assists. Goalkeeper Jane
Kendall 'OO blocked two shots to
pick up the shutout. Coach Karen
Borbee commented, "The game
was very similar to the first time
we played them. Other than the
field conditions, which made the
game a lot sloppier, we dominated
Drew for most of the game."
Third-seeded William Paterson
upset the number two team
Gettysburg 1-0 in their first round
match, which excited many
Swarthmore players. Lynne
Steuerle '99 said that the prospect
of facing a new opponent made her
"a little nervous, but actually

pleased, because we didn't have any
history to rely on. For instance, had
we played Gettysburg, it wouldhave
been easier to say, 'We beat them 52 last time, we can win again.' Instead, we had to get ourselves up and
ready for a new opponent." Coach
Borbee cited a second reason why
the team was eager to play the Pioneers in the finals rather than the
Gettysburg Bullets, 'The coach from
William Paterson was a member of
the committee that did not select us
to go to the NCAA Tournament. I
really wanted her to see this team
play and see that the decision was a
mistake. I feel we made our point."
Indeed they did, as the Garnet
squashed their opponent, 4-1.

MichelleWalsh '9B scored from the
top of the circle and Julie Finnegan
'OO followed with a goal off a rebound to give Swat a 2-0 lead. The
Pioneers' only goal came off a penalty stroke. Duffy scored a pair of
second half goals to give the team a
three goal lead. Hagan and Holly
Baker '99 picked up assists in the
title game. Duffy was named the
Tournament's Most Valuable Player.
"William Paterson's defense was
very strong; however, their offense
was not as potent as we have seen in
other teams. Because of this, we
were able to dominate the
gameand keep it on our end of the
field most of the game," said
Steuerle. "We played our game, even

through the mud. We played as a
team and broke down their resistance," said Sujin Seo '9B. "We
stayed hungry right to the end with
everybody playing solid if not stellar games."
The team was thrilled with the
tournament win. "It's always nice
to end the season with a win AND a
championship but it was so appropriate for this special team. They had
an incredible season and deserve to
be recognized for all their accomplishments," said Borbee. "Although
it was disappointing not to make it
to the NCAA's this year, winning the
ECAC's and knowing that we've
sent a message to those involved in

Swarthmore's success was attributed to the infamous Artingstall "increase your aerobic threshold"
workouts.
Seven men wrestled for Swat in
the tourney that allows each man
to test his skills early in the year.
Wrestling up in the 158-pound division, Pete Balvanz '9B dominated
the mat with only one takedown
against him. After many successful matches, Balvanz placed first.
Alejandro Montero 'OO in the 177
pound division placed fourth as did

AdrianWilson '99 in the 134pound
class. Wilson though seemed to be
dissatisfied with his appearance. In
the heavyweight class, Sean Lewis
'OO finished in third. Aaron
Kobernick 'OO and Matt Kahn '99
each wrestled a few good matches
although both were outmatched in
their weight classes. In his debut,
Ben Gaines 'Ol performed well.
Overall, Balvanz felt the day was
productive and "allowed everyone to
cut loose and experiment with everything they had learned in the past few
weeks." The wrestling squad will
travel to Princeton next weekend to
face Princeton, New York University
and Monclair State.

Rugby ends slump, takes

By
and

Saturday, in the mud-pit formerly
known as Dupont field, the Swat
women's rugby team exploded out
oftheir two week slump and made
swiss cheese out of their
Shippensburg opponent. After a
disappointing loss last Saturday, the
Swat team arrived on the pitch with
something to prove. They did just
that, and Shippensburg left the field
with two losses added to their
record. A-side made mincemeat of
the opposing squad in the first game
winning 20-5. The B-side team
pulled out a heartstopping last second victory, 8-5, with the winning
try being scored in the last minute
of play.
Megan Brennan 'OO started the
scoring frenzy early in the first half
with an aggressive drive into the try
zone in the wake of the Swarthmore
forwards. Swarthmore's pack, led
by captain Becky Snyder '9B dominated the rucks and mauls pushing
the weaker Shippensburg team
down the field gaining much offensive yardage. Joan Hoffmann '9B
and Sarah Cross '99 provided essential strength and stability to the
Swat scrum, despite the swamp-

like conditions. Turning on the
guns, Mary McGuire 'OO, wearing
her mud mask, aggressively
hustled to support her teammates.
Danielle Thomas '99 returned to
the field after two weeks of injury
time and tackled with enthusiasm
and force bringing players to the
soggy turf repeatedly. Kim Hart
'9B and Phil Meehan 'Ol played
spectacularly in theirA-side debut,
stopping incoming Ship players
again and again. The Swat backs,
led by Courtney Clark '9B, played
their best collective game of the
season and dazzled the fans in attendance with tremendous offensive prowess, executing passes with
accuracy and fluidity. The second
try, scored beautifully by Liza "where's
the video camera" Bonilla '9B, was the
culmination ofthe efforts of the entire
back line. Charity Miller '9B set up the
zone for Bonilla with lightning quick
hands and the great ability to create
scoring opportunities for her teammates. Cathy Vaughan 'Ol and Noelle
Goodin 'OO played brilliantly at the
wings, blocking kicks and making
important tackles. Beth Wiles '9B
played a great game as well and used
her amazing foot to add 5 more
points to the scoreboard. The final
try was scored by the aggressive and

out

talented Bridget Arbour '9B, who
dominated the game with her impressive rucking ability and unbelievable
speed.
The B-side game was just as exciting and rewarding. The back line
followed in the footsteps of A-side,
passing and looping effectively and
expertly as the ball progressed down
the field. Morgan Kelly '9B led the
backs at fly half and played ex-

The Garnet Tide dropped a 56-0
decision to playoff-bound Western
Maryland last Saturday. The Tide
were outmanned by the Terror's 95
man roster and were shutout for the
third time in a row and sixth time
in nine games this season.
The Green Terror struck early,
scoring on its first play from scrimmage on a long pass. Afterwards,
the defense, which has been playing more physical as the year has
gone on, shut down the opponents
on the next three series. Western
Maryland took advantage of two
late Tide turnovers deep in their
own territory to pull ahead 21-0
after the first quarter.
The Green Terror added three
more touchdowns in the second
quarter while Swarthmore's offense
could only manage two first downs.
Western Maryland then returned
the opening kickoff of the second
half for a touchdown and then
coasted the rest of the way to victory.
Asked to reflect on the game, senior co-captain Ben Hall commented, "With the exception of one
play, we stayed with them for a
while. Unfortunately, we weren't

able to sustain the intensity level
because so many guys were going
both ways." Due to the lack of
numbers, nine players, including
Hall all contributed on both sidesÂ»j
of the ball. In an era where it is
extremely rare to see even one
player taking some plays on both
defense and offense, Swarthmore
has no choice but to play their players both ways.
"For the third straight game, the
defense played physical," commented defensive coordinator Don
Burns. Seniors Bernard Nossuli,
Aaron Hultgren and Ben Hall each
had a sack, as did Matt Asano.
Tucker Zengerle 'OO once again
played an excellent game, finishing with a game-high 17 tackles.
Zengerle leads the conference with*
an average of over 15 tackles a
game.
Offensively, the Garnet were never
a threat to score. However, Mason
Tootell '99 continues to be a bright
spot for the Tide as he finished with
7 receptions for 88 yards. Tootell is
third in the conference in both receptions and all-purpose yards.
The Tide (0-9) travel to Virginia to
play Washington & Lee for the last
game for senior co-captains Hall and
Nossuli. The Generals, at 3-6, are a
beatable team.

Shippensburg
tremely well both offensively and
defensively. Ursula Lang 'OO and
Erica Anderson 'Ol also had great
games. Lang passed well and gained
ground often helping Swat effort to
move down the field. Anderson tackled aggressively and didn't let Ship
players past her.
The forward pack played hard in
the midst of mud and slop. Marisa
Chavez 'Ol and Arianna Freeman

'Ol, stepped up to the challenge and
hustled their butts off for the whole
game. Alexa Miller'oo was all over
the field carrying the ball and charging toward the try zone. Rhiana
Swartz 'OO kicked a 3 point penalty
to put Swat on the board and Miller
sealed the victory with a last minute*
dive into the try zone. Swartz and
Miller celebrated with a slide
through the mud.
