Following recent trends for most colleges and universities in the U.S., Swarthmore's
acceptance rate declines to 15 percent, with an increase in the number of applicants.

BY ELI SIEGEL

esiegel2@swarthmore.edu

Nine hundred and seventy seven
prospective students have been accepted
to the class of 2015. These students were
admitted out of 6,547 total applicants, the
highest number ever, for an acceptance
rate of approximately 15 percent. The

admitted students come from six continents, 64 nations and 50 U.S. states as
well as the District of Columbia, Guam
and Puerto Rico. Among them are an
accomplished trick water skier, a ballroom dancing champion and two
prospective engineers who have built
hovercrafts.
This year saw the highest number of
applications on record, with the largest
increases coming from California, New
York and outside of the United States.
Jim Bock '9O, Dean of Admissions
and Financial Aid, believes that the college is better able to attract international students due to the increased number
of people abroad who want a liberal arts
education and see Swarthmore at the top
of the rankings in this category.

The class of 2013 has about 28 international students. This number rose to
roughly 44 for the class of 2014.
"Many international students are
interested in a small supportive liberal
arts education," International Students
and Scholars Advisor Jennifer MarksGold said. "Sometimes they don't have
family or extra support [in the US], I
help
get
[to
them
acclimated
Swarthmore]."
Joyce Wu, a member of the class of
2015 from Hong Kong, said the commu-

nicative academic environment drew
her to the college. "A big [reason I liked
Swarthmore] was the atmosphere of
learning for the sake of learning and not
for grades."
Anushka Mehta, an admitted student
from Egypt, was attracted to the range of
different students on campus. "I wanted
a college with a large international community where diversity was embraced,
so I could meet people from different
countries and maybe fellow Egyptians
and Indians," Mehta said.
Out of the admitted students, Bock
hopes to yield a class of 383 members, a

April 14, 2011

In the event that the admitted class
size is not large enough, or underenrolled, admissions would move to the
waitlist to look for additional candidates. About 950 people were offered a
place on the waitlist this year. In general, Bock said, about one-third of these
students accept the offer to be on the
waitlist, another third reject the offer
and the last third do not respond.
However, it is rare to be admitted from
the waitlist. Last year, only seven students were accepted.
"We've taken as few as zero, but as
many as 75 [from the waitlist]," Bock
said. When deciding whom to take from
the waitlist, admissions is looking more
for students who really want to be here,
rather than for students who would fill
certain needs of the college, such as
members of athletic teams or musicians.
As students decide whether to come
to Swarthmore, Bock hopes that they
will take note of the unique community.
He said that the external pressures,
such as class ranking and GPA, are
pulled off and instead students work in
collaboration to succeed. Additionally,
professors take an active interest in
their students, working with them oneon-one and challenging them to be real
scholars.
"I've never met a more accessible student body or faculty," Bock said. "Some
of the best conversations I've ever had
have been with Swarthmore students
and faculty."
Ben Grandis, a member of the class of
2015 who has already accepted the college's offer of admission, said the collaborative academic atmosphere attracted
him to the college.
"Swarthmore felt right to me because
it really felt like the kind of school
where the academic challenge would
ultimately be worth it. It is full of the
intelligent peers necessary to truly
inspire me and enrich the future of my
education," Grandis said.
Other admitted students, such as
George Price from Pittsburgh, are
attracted to the college's campus.
"Swarthmore has an epic walk in the
middle of an amazing arboretum and a
fast train into Philadelphia." Price said.
Students have until May 1 to accept
the college's offer of admission.

On April 1, President Barack
Obama officially declared April to be
Sexual Assault Awareness Month.
Vice President Joe Biden spoke
recently at the University of New
Hampshire to encourage colleges and
universities to take on new responsibilities in enforcing Title IX guidelines regarding the handling of sexual assault and rape. This nationwide
focus on issues related to sexual
assault and misconduct provides the
Swarthmore community with an
opportunity to facilitate further discussion regarding recent and past
incidents on campus.

Opportunities Officer.
According to Dean Henry, the letter may change some aspects of

Swarthmore's policy on sexual
assault. For example, Swarthmore
may be obligated under the new clarification to pursue every perpetrator
of sexual assault.
Currently, Swarthmore allows the
survivor of the assault to decide
whether further action is taken or
not. "A student who comes forward
might not have control about
whether we investigate," Henry said,
who worries that students may be
less willing to report cases under the
new stipulations.

Nationwide spotlight on sexual assault now hovers over Swarthmore
The administration strives to do all it can for the
survivors of sexual assault. "The school provides
many avenues for survivors to take in the aftermath
of an attack. I think our philosophy has really been
first and foremost, supporting the survivors and
making sure that they're aware of all the different
options. I think it's really important that all the survivors know," Dean of Students Liz Braun said.
These options include available support from the
deans, SMART team members, Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS), Worth health center
and the RAs.
CAPS members are available to students 24/7 and
provide therapy sessions with complete confidentiality. "I think it's very important that clinicians not
have an agenda for what a student should do. We're
there to help the students unpack this experience,
CAPS director David Ramirez said.
CAPS not only provides support for students who
seek it but also helps to train RAs so that they can
provide another dimension of support for survivors
of sexual assault who come to them.
Students can also seek help and advice from the
deans and SMART team members. Members of the
deans' office and SMART team members officially
report any incidents brought to them, and Dean
Henry tries to help the survivor take whatever steps
she or he wishes. "Some of the first things I do is to
try to attend to the student's medical needs ... and
then we talk about various options for resolving the
situation. We encourage students to go the police, to
go to the student judicial system, and any variety of
informal ways resolve an issue of sexual misconduct," Henry said.

mention the ever-growing stack ofreadings on your desk that you haven't even
looked at yet, probably because of some
combination of the aforementioned factors?
I have been a devout multitasker for
as long as I can remember. During the
three minutes I spend brushing my
teeth in the evening, I empty my trash,
recycle my bottles and compost my
fruit. Whenever a professor has to
warm up the projector to start a presentation, I utilize those seconds to check a
few news sites and sift through my email inbox. However, the mere fact that
we are good at multitasking does not
mean that multitasking is good for us.
During my four years at Swarthmore, I
have routinely encountered scenarios
where multitasking backfires, sometimes catastrophically. For example,
sleep multitasking is a myth. If you find
yourself waking up at 3am to check
your e-mail, Twitter, Facebook, etc., I

tasks grow more complex, our ability to
effectively multitask,disintegrates into

probably knows by now that if you need
to concentrate on something complex
like a problem set or a seminar paper,
your' cell phone is one of your worst
enemies. Time and time again, just as
you get over the hump of distraction
and truly begin to concentrate, your
phone will vibrate, selfishly beckoning
your attention. Smartphones are particularly devious, because they not only
notify you of text messages, but also of
e-mails, Facebook and Twitter updates,
instant messages, new updates for your
apps and, I swear, half the time these
phones vibrate just to let you know
they're getting lonely in your pocket
and want some attention. Even something as simple as iTunes can send your
productivity to zero. When you're deep
in thought, constructing a sentence for
a paper, how many times has iTunes
started playing a song you didn't like,
and you suddenly had to stop everything and switch songs or playlists?
It's not just the complexity of the
task at hand that matters to our productivity. Studies show that the proportion of time you spend doing other
simultaneous tasks matters, too. If

to look up in Google, your concentration won't be too adversely affected.
However, if you choose to explore

will suffer.

Hungary poses challenges to assimilating ethnic groups

preparation for her study
abroad in Budapest this
summer, as she was trying to determine whether

Hungarian Identity
me about my experience
as an Asian in Budapest.
To be honest, I had
nearly forgotten that I am an Asian living in
Budapest, since there has been no such experience
against me that reminded me particularly of my
racial identity. However, as I consider my past three
months in Budapest, I have definitely explored the
general issues of diversity and tolerance in Hungary.
The first time that I encountered issues of diversity and tolerance in Hungary was in Pecs, an old
town in southern Hungary. In the center of the town,
there is a Catholic church that resembles a mosque
with Turkish epigraphs and Islamic decoration preserved on its walls. The building is truly extraordinary, and I've never seen a Catholic church embedded in Islamic artistic traditions in such a way.
Historically, there was a church of St.
Bartholomew in Pecs during the Middle Ages, but
the Turks destroyed the church and then turned it
into a mosque when they conquered Pecs in the 16th
century. After the Turks were driven away, the
mosque was given to the Jesuits who chose to preserve the remnants, rather than destroy the church

as the Turks did.
In the breakfast room of the hotel that my landlady's family and I stayed in, there was a stone plate
on the wall that commemorated the laborers who
actually built the villa in the end of the 19th century.
My landlady told me that the last names indicated
that not all of the people were (originally)
â¢Hungarians, and that many had Russian, Polish,
Jewish, Romanian and German last names. My landr
lady told me she has a German last name too, as her
father was a Swiss. During my stay in Pecs I got the
impression that Hungary is religiously tolerant,
diverse in nationality and has respect for ordinary
laborers.
However, modern Hungary seems to face new
challenges. Impressed by this diversity I had discovered thus far, I mentioned to a Hungarian friend that
Hungary is much more diverse and tolerant than I
had originally believed. Yet, he cut me off to clarify
and said, "Well, diverse, but not necessarily in a
good way. As you see their restaurants everywhere,
there is a growing Arabic and Chinese population,
but they are not really integrated in our country."
His comment surprised me, as the diversity I was
speaking ofreferred to the people of German, Jewish
and Russian descent. However, for a Hungarian, the
first people who come to mind in consideration of
diversity were the Chinese and Arabic populations.
I realized my friend was right, specifically in
regards to the difficulty of assimilation of the
Chinese and Arabic population, which I noticed
firsthand. There is an Arabic family near my neighborhood who aren't completely integrated. They
emigrated from Palestine more than ten years ago
and the husband sells gyros near the house where I
reside.
He is very nice, and understands English but
doesn't take my order unless I speak in Hungarian

and teaches me some Hungarian words whenever I
visit his gyros shop. Though my landlady seems to
like him, the manner in which she and her husband
talk about him suggests that they do not consider
him as a true Hungarian. The major reason is that
his Hungarian is not perfect.
On the other hand, I remember an instance in the
Japanese conversation club I attend where a gentleman, who spoke Hungarian so well that everybody
(including the Hungarians) believed him to be
Hungarian, revealed he was Italian. Such stories do
not suggest any sort of racism, but suggest to me
instead that language ability and appearance are two
of the most immediate and apparent features used to
identify nationality. Thus, these characteristics
become the keys to appearing "integrated."
Another group of people who do not seem to be
completely integrated in society are gypsies. I was
asked by a Japanese teacher to read and comment on
some of the Hungarian Japanese-majors' discussion
posts online. The second post I read discussed a criticism of prejudice and discrimination against gypsies in Hungary. The student addressed stereotypes
of gypsies as uneducated and unwilling to work
hard, but the student explained that such social prejudices are simply unacceptable.
This is what I've observed as to diversity in
Hungary and the problems Hungary has seem to be
ones characteristic of most multi-ethnic countries.
In general, the challenges of assimilation and particular stereotypes for certain populations within a
country are not easily resolved. However, in
Hungary's case, a possible resolution that a differentiated person can have is to be optimistic, since that
is sarcastic diversity to the legendary pessimistic
and sarcastic Hungarians.

for National Public Radio's "Morning
Edition." To avoid giving too much information away, the alum kept the description of
his lecture
"Swarthmore Made Me: A
Critic's Secret Life"
brief yet intriguing.
"There were events that happened to me at
Swarthmore that I think were critical in
where my life ended up and both in my
becoming a writer and a film critic," Turan
said.
Following graduation from Swarthmore
with a B.A. in history, Turan received his
from Columbia University's
Masters
Graduate School of Journalism. Afterwards
he worked as a sports writer and feature
writer for the Washington Post, and has
worked as a film critic since 1991 for theLos
Angeles Times, Director for the Los Angeles
Times Book Prizes since 1993, and provides
movie reviews for NPR's "Morning Edition."
Professor and chairperson of film and
media studies Patricia White considers
Turan a personal role model and admires his
presence as a daily film critic "right in the
belly of the entertainment industry," as a
weekly voice on NPR, and as an author of
numerous books on film and theater.
"That's striking a balance between being
constantly 'on' and taking the time for reflection that longer works require," White said
in an e-mail. "I think being an intellectual in
the public sphere, bridging entertainment
and politics, is a worthy post-Swarthmore
goal and something the college prepares you
for."
When questioned about his career "journey," Turan described the experience as a
gradual process of figuring out what is right
for you. He said, "When you are on journeys
like that, you don't think of them as journeys.
You are really just trying to figure out what
to do next and that's what I was always trying to figure out âwhat would happen next."
Sans a grand plan, Turan simply knew that
he "loved journalism and wanted to be a part
of it."
Teaching film reviewing and nonfiction
writing at the University of Southern
California, Turan sees a lot of himself in his
own students. "I'm excited by the field and I
was hoping there was a place for me, which is
exactly how my students feel," he said. The
academic atmosphere of Swarthmore influences Turan's own teaching style, which he
feels is "an attempt to make my students get
as much out of my class as I got out of the
classes I took at Swarthmore."
Any film review will yield disparate reactions whether readers are nodding in agreement or pounding their fists with anger and
irritation. In response to Turan's 1997 review
of "Titanic," entitled "'Titanic' Sinks Again
(Spectacularly)," director of the film James
Cameron angrily demanded that Turan be
fired by the Times. Whether positive or negative, Turan believes it is best to refrain from
thinking about the outcome of a review and
"not to try to second guess yourself ahead of

the fact. You just write the best, most honest

review you can do
that's what you have to
do. You can't think about who might either be
upset or happy about it
you have to be true
to your own ideas and not think about how
people might react to it," Turan said.
In consideration of Turan's work, White
admires the writer's dedication to the field.
"[Turan's] work is populist without ever
dumbing things down. He's passionately committed to independent film, to world film culture, and he takes the responsibility of a film
critic for establishing a filmmaker's reputation or the viability of a film very seriously,"
she said.
Each movie critic approaches films in
their own style and hones in on particular
qualities that they believe are essential to the
film. To critique any film, Turan explains, is
very personal and thus for him, he considers
whether or not a film is what he had hoped it
would be. Is the comedy making him laugh
and is the thriller provoking excitement for
him? Also, Turan relies on a second piece of
criteria. "I'm basically looking to see if the
living up to
film is fulfilling its potential
its aspirations for itself," he said.
Few movie critics would be successful or
even entertaining in the long run without a
levelheaded and sensible approach to their
critique. Reviewing a film merely to lambaste
it as 'the worst film ever' or exalting it as 'the
finest piece of work ever produced' is neither
helpful nor insightful. Turan explained that
though he would instinctively watch films
and analyze them, he had to fine-tune this
"inborn tendency to being a good critic" and
being levelheaded through practice because
"practice is a good things, practices makes
you better."
the
Turan does have a favorite film
French 1945 film "Les Enfants du Paradis"
(Children of Paradise), which tells the story
of a young courtesan and the four men who
love her, set in the Parisian theatre scene of
the 1820s and '3os. Along with appreciating
foreign film, Turan appreciates foreign cultures and believes that if given the chance to
rewrite his Swarthmore days, he would
enroll in many more foreign language courses. Since he did not have an affinity for languages, he kept his distance from them as
much as possible as a student. However,
since his profession requires him to travel to
film festivals and interact with people who
know several tongues, Turan has grown to
appreciate language skills. "It's not just
something to know, it is a way to communicate. I wish I had more ways to communicate," Turan said.
This weekend's first Art Weekend will
replace the customary Family Weekend in
the spring semester, which was moved to the
fall semester/With a successful career in the
arts and with broad appeal, Director of
Advancement Services and Arts Weekend
organizer Drusie Sheldon believed that
Turan would be a fitting speaker for the
weekend. In addition, Turan's own desire to
give something back to the community
inspired Sheldon's selection. "[Turan] was
more than someone we just wanted at the college, but we know he is ready to come and do
something himself. It's a wonderful combina-

as we want him to do it for us," Sheldon said.
Along with Turan's lecture, this weekend
will also feature exhibits, lectures and performances including Rhythm and Motion, the
theater department's Advanced Directing
Workshop's Swarthmore Follies 2011, and also
a talk by former faculty member Teya
Sepinuck who taught in the Dance department for more than 15 years. Sepinuck is the
founder and artistic director of the Theatre of
Witness Programme, which performs a form
of theater (called "Theatre of Witness") that
Sepinuck developed while on the faculty of
Swarthmore College. She spent the last two
years* in Northern Ireland working on
Theatre of Witness productions where she
draws from her work with prisoners,
refugees, survivors and perpetrators of violence to create a safe place for audiences to
explore issues of social justice.
Since two students have interned with
Sepinuck abroad, Sheldon believes the lecture "brings the opportunity to not just hear
about faculty member's work, but also how
that links into internships and experiences
for the students." Also, Sheldon hopes that
the weekend will encourage students and parents to "understand one another a little better" and open up dialogue about the benefits
of the arts in the College's curriculum.
The College's arts programs draw students
from various departments, which Sheldon
believes emphasizes "the value that the arts
brings to the whole educational experience
and helping [students] to think more creatively." In anticipation of this weekend,
Turan appreciates its objectives and purpose
to promote the arts and said, "I think that the
arts have not always been at the forefront of
how the college presents itself and I'm really
happy to see that changing."

Style

Name: Alexander Hollender

Year: 2011
From: Charlotte, Vermont

Current Residence: Wharton

What He's Wearing:
Hollender is wearing a grey wool cardigan over a buttoned up blue Oxford shirt, along with floral-printed white
denim shorts and off-white Superga shoes, sans socks.
Usually, he opts for plain items of clothes, while mixing and
matching different fabrics and colors. Featured in his outfit, his white shoes have been a staple in his wardrobefor
many years. "No matter what I'm wearing, I'll feel alright if
it just does it for me," he said.
I have white shoes on
...

How He Describes His Style:
Steering away from expensive garments, garish colors
and shiny fabrics, Hollender prefers muted colors and
simple, classic items. "I usually try to pick generic items
like jeans and shirts, and I will find one thing to wear that
is more fun, interesting and breaks the monotony," he
said. Occasionally, Hollander will choose to wear pieces
unconventionally, such as buttoning up his shirt to the top
and describes peoples' irritation with this style as "the
top-button phenomenon." "People are always trying to
correct the way you dress which is kind of a funny
thought," he said. "People definitely notice."
Fashion Inspirations and Influences:

Aside from being influenced by his mother's taste for
subtle styles, Hollender is inspired by photography in creating his outfits. "Old photographs [are] where you can
find some of the best fashion and style," he said. Citing the
black-and-white works of renowned American photographers such as William Klein and Robert Frank, Hollender
enjoys studying how people dressed in the past. "The further back you go in time, the more uniformly people
dress," he said. In particular, he is inspired by the trends
of the 'sos to early 'BO and by looking at photography, tries
to identify the "standard" item worn during this period.
Then, he tries to recreate the iconic looks, albeit with a
modern flair.
Also, Hollender has an affinity for "Trad," a style of
men's fashion displayed by Ivy League college students
during the late 19505. Often interchanged with "preppy,"

Fashion and His Interest in Art:
For Hollender, who is an art history major, both fashion and art have a
lot in common. "[Fashion is] an outlet
of creativity. It includes a lot of the
same processes that art does," he said.
For him, dressing up echoes creating a
collage since both require selecting and
compiling materials to make a cohesive
whole. "When you're interested in art
and in touch with the art world, it turns
fashion into a fun game," Hollender said.
On Creating Fashion:

Instead of pursuing typical extracurricular activities at college, Hollender became
an entrepreneur by heading a fashion label.
Collaborating with two friends, Jordan
Boyea and Jesse Zorski, Hollender established a T-shirt company entitled "Create
Build Destroy" three years ago. "I don't wear
that many graphic t-shirts anymore, [but]
they used to be a huge part of my wardrobe. I
think that led me wanting to do a t-shirt company," he said.
With internship experience at Helmut
Lang, Hollender's connections with the prominent fashion brand influenced and assisted ir
the production and construction of his compa
ny's garments. He describes the style of th
graphic, printed t-shirts as being "edgy an
iconoclastic." Hollender said, "It didn'tturn into â â -wKumm
so much a business endeavor thana creative and
experimental endeavor." Despite his creative intentions,
"Create Build Destroy" garments are now sold internationally in locations such as France, Italy, Denmark and

this Sunday but things were grim as ever
anyway. This was largely because everyone was so disappointed to discover that
they were no longer drunk and were

wearing more than their underwear, a

jarring realization under any circumstances. Yes, this particular Sunday was
not so good for anyone.

I have often examined the effect of
Swarthmore on campus wildlife, but
have not previously looked at what it can
do to technology. This isbecause I do not
get along with technology. You know how
people who are not very good with computers are always talking about how computers shut down in their presence? I'm
one of them. "Computers don't work
when I'm around," we say. "They catch

from me!" I'm worse than average.
Seventy percent of the time I don't even
recognize computers and start treating
them as though they're cats. I am however very fond of my computer. It is true
that the poor thing leads a pretty weird
life with me and sometimes it becomes
overwhelmed. On Sunday, with the feeling on campus being what it was, my
computer actually became so distressed
that it gave up entirely and refused to do
anything but play the song "Blame it On

On Monday the weather was such that
the student body was thrown into a sort

clutching our homework to our chests,
hoping readings would be read and problems would be solved without any help
from us because there certainly wasn't
going to be any. No one knew what was
going on
many were suspicious. Most
were simply short-circuited. By midnight j
a substantial number of students had

and chanting "Too little sleep!! Too Little

StaffEditorial

In light ofbudget debacle, Obama offers prudent fiscal plan
As members of Congress look to congratulate
themselves for avoiding a complete shutdown of the
federal government, they overlook the fact that the
real possibility of the federal government closing
should never have been on the table. For mere hours
to stand between legislators and a shutdown demonstrates the irresponsibility of those preventing another stopgap budget from passing.
Furthermore, the concessions made by both
Democrats and Republicans reflect poorly on both
parties. Democrats let some of their favored programs and campaign selling points receive cuts, such
as the President's high-speed rail initiative and
Department of Education programs. Republicans let
social programs, such as federal funding of Planned
Parenthood, be left out of the more ideologically
indiscriminate short-term project.
Some of the cuts made to prevent a shutdown were
not controversial and entirely reasonable. For example, Congress cut unspent money in funds for projects
that have been completed or won't be completed, such
as SL7 billion from the Census fund and $2.5 billion
from highway funds. However, other targets veer
towards potential dangerous defunding
$7OO million was taken away from clean and safe drinking
water programs, while $276 million was cut from programs to prevent pandemic flu.

stop

Nonetheless, the aggressive cuts Congress will be
making in the future will undoubtedly strain federal
workers further as entire programs, and thus jobs,
are cut.
As the jobless rate shrunk in March, the potential
for Obama in the 2012 election looked up. However,
with the negative press surrounding the budget and
the elimination of federal jobs looming, this gain
could easily be reversed. The concessions made by
Obama and the Democrats could be used as a major
selling point for the Republicans in 2012, when they
would have the opportunity to portray their opponents as weak and poor advocates of their own ideals.
On the other hand, Democrats could portray the

cartoon

by

emma

GOP as cutting programs that are pro-future (proinvestment programs such as the high-speed rail program) and helpful to those who cannot completely
support themselves (such as the potential cuts to
Medicaid).

President Obama looked to do just that in his
detailed speech on fiscal policy Wednesday. He rightfully acknowledged that the cuts made last week are
only part of the solution to dealing with the U.S.'s
mounting debt. The President warned Wednesday
that "this rising debt... will prevent us from making
the investments we need to win the future." For this
reason, Obama presented four steps as part of "a more
balanced approach to achieve $4 trillion in deficit
reduction over 12 years."
The first step is the deal agreed upon last week.
The second step is to further reduce defense spending, continuing the work Secretary ofDefense Robert
Gates has done in the past 2 years cutting $4OO billion
of wasteful spending.
The third step is to reduce health care spending.
The President aptly pointed out something
Republicans seem to be missing: the poor and the elderly should not have to pay more for their health
care. Rather, the government should spend less by
reducing the cost of health care itself. This approach
accounts for the fact that the existence of entitlements is not a problem, despite what many conservatives may say.
As Obama emphasized in his speech, the American
spirit is critical of excessive government while recognizing that the government should provide a safety
net
one that includes Medicare and Medicaid.
The fourth step is tax reform. Obama pledged to
allow the Bush tax cuts for the wealth expire, citing
improvement on the progressive logic of our income
tax system. While raising taxes is never popular, cutting spending alone will not sustain this anti-deficit
and debt craze.
Obama also correctly noted that these cuts must be
phased in over the next decade. The economy's fragile recovery would be severely disrupted by sudden
drops in spending, and growing the economy lessens
the deficit, so it is in all parties' interests to promote

waitzman

growth. Austerity in the near future will not solve
any problems.
The President's emphasis on the government as a
protector is not a view shared by all, or even most
members of Congress. The budget compromise last
week has forced a broad discussion on the proper role
and size of the federal government, a discussion that
will likely remain prevalent in the 2012 election.
Though many voters have articulated in polls that
cutting the deficit and reigning in the federal government is a priority, they hesitate to support cutting
any programs from which they benefit.
Accordingly, the Democrats may have the upper
hand on the issue of the deficit and debt if they follow Obama's tenets laid out in Wednesday's speech.
Republican members of Congress will have to face the
music with their constituents when they insist on
cutting popular programs rather than, for example,
fixing the underlying problem with health care,
namely its rising costs.
Nonetheless, both last week's budget battle and the
upcoming mudslinging over raising the debt ceiling
will reflect poorly on both parties in 2012.

lion at the federal level.
This is a welcome change. The past couple of years
have seen a rapid expansion of government with the
bailouts at the end of the Bush administration and
President Obama's stimulus package and healthcare
reform legislation. Even earlier on in the Bush administration, Republicans were abandoning their principles
and spending without balancing the budget.
This budget victory for the Republicans has shown
that the country is ready for a smaller government.
America elected Republicans, including many members
of the Tea Party, to cut the budget and reduce that deficit.
And that is exactly what is going on.
Even President Obama appears to recognize this fact,
evidenced by his decision to compromise. Obama went as
far as calling the cuts "historic," and he attempted to take
the spotlight away from Speaker John Boehner, whose
leadership was more instrumental in bringing about the
compromise. This is a far cry from the days of the $787 billion stimulus package.
While some Congressional Republicans, including Tea

activist and potential GOP presidential contender
Congresswoman Michelle Bachmann (R-MN), are complaining that the budget was not cut enough, they need to
understand that this was a step in the right direction.
Last year, we saw a 14 percent increase in domestic discretionary spending. In 2011, this spending will be
reduced by 4 percent. We cannot undo the major expansion of government that has taken place over the last few
years overnight. Any step in the right direction must be
Party

celebrated.
We have seen that both President Obama and the
Republicans can work together and pass legislation. The
Republicans are no longer just the party of "no." They
should use this advantage as they debate raising the debt
ceiling, an action that will need to be taken soon.
Legislation should be attached to any bill about raising
the debt ceiling to make sure that this does not need to be
done again in the near-future. The Wall Street Journal's
April 11 editorial has a few ideas for this legislation: preventing Congress from allowing the debt to go above a
certain percentage of GDP, making Congress start with a
budget framework that does not have "automatic increases" every year, etc.
Republicans should not make the mistake of tying
social issues to budgetary matters in Congress. While I
take issue with government-funded abortion and the
amount of money we give to Planned Parenthood, these
are issues to be dealt with as a separate matter. There is
a much larger contingent of the American electorate that
favors cutting spending and reducing the debt than there
are opponents to funding for Planned Parenthood.
I do not agree with Governor Mitch Daniels' (R-IN) call
for a "truce" on social issues. I just think there is a time
and place in legislation to deal with those types of issues.
Budgetary matters are not one of those places. The government could very well have shut down last week over
the Republicans' desire to defund Planned Parenthood.
This move would not have net positive effects for the

Republicans.
Republicans have found a winning issue in being serious about slashing government spending. Prior to the
threat of a shutdown last week, public opinion polls found

that Obama and the Democrats would be blamed for the
shutdown about as equally as Republicans. It is likely
that the President would only have allowed a shutdown to
happen if it was politically savvy for him to do so. Once it
became clear that this was not the case, Obama came
around and went along with the budget the Republicans
were offering.
Republicans have returned to being the party of limited government. Over the next year as the party assembles
a new budget in the House and votes to raise the debt ceiling, Republicans should continue to flex their budget
muscle. Republicans must look for waste in government
and eliminate it. Find programs that are duplicates and
combine them. End programs that do not accomplish
what they were meant to do. This would not only reduce
the size of the federal government. It would also make the
government more effective.
We all know that it is not possible to reduce the deficit
only by decreasing domestic discretionary spending.
Republicans and Democrats alike are going to eventually
have to reform the Medicare and Social Security systems.
Now is the time to offer solutions to solving our Medicare
and Social Security problems while the country is in the
mood for a smaller government.
Republicans have finally listened: be the party offiscal
responsibility, and the public will reward you. President
Obama cannot stop an American electorate looking to
change the face of government. Republicans should iake
small strides toward reducing the deficit and the size of
government, reveling in their accomplishments each
time. This is going to be a long process, and each move
toward fiscal sanity is a step in the right direction.

mundane and far enough away to feel less
than real. It's telling that it's become a
cliche to point out that a hundred killings
of poor men in urban ghettos get less
attention than the murder of a few white
women by a serial killer.
Part of the reason for inaction is that
even the most ardent do-gooders feel helpless. In the battle against urban poverty
and violent crime there's no obvious
enemy and no movement to join. Even a

getting rid of concentrated urban poverty
is like building a competitive third-party
or passing single-payer healthcare; it
won't ever happen, so why bother trying.
Part of the problem is an ahistorical or
historically misguided perspective. A few
common myths should be decisively
rejected. The experience of blacks and
Latinos that make up the majority of
today's urban underclass has never been
comparable to that of poor white ethnics
in earlier periods of American history.
Thomas Sugrue's "The Origins of the
Urban Crisis" describes the unique obstacles faced by blacks in urban Detroit.
Hyper-ghettoization was the direct result
of local and federal officials' success in
excluding blacks from New Deal housing
subsidies and homeowners and community members' success in barring blacks
from moving into their neighborhoods.
Meanwhile urban renewal projects
lessened the already minimal pool of
housing stock available to poor blacks

reduced the tax base that supported
invaluable public institutions like schools
and parks, but also created a spatial mismatch between work and residence for the
urban minority poor.
Personal responsibility has little to no
explanatory power in describing the rise
of today's urban underclass or in distinguishing today's urban minority poor
from the white ethnics who came before
them. As a framework for conceptualizing
potential solutions it may have some use,
by, for example, suggesting the importance of strong role models and high
expectations at school. But as the single or
one of the most important causal factors
for the state of today's urban ghettos, it is
nothing more than the academic codification of a racist ideology rooted in the politics of white backlash.
To suggest that today's urban minority
poor are somehow less responsible than
others would be living in the same context
with exactly the same history is to suggest
that there's something qualitatively different about "those people." The strong
association between race and class in the
minds of most Americans today has made
this contention even more salient.
Throughout all of American history it has
been used against both minorities and the
poor. In this context it should be unsurprising that many middle-class and upperclass conservative minorities have
jumped on the personal-responsibility
bandwagon.

To what extent housing and employment discrimination still impact black

debate. Although grass roots community
resistance may have lessened, white flight
remains prevalent and public housing policy still does little to promote real integra-

Yet even if we pretend that there is no

the legacy of the processes discussed
above
the monstrous, brutal and completely legal institutionalized discrimination of the criminal justice system. The
mass incarceration of America's minority
poor largely for non-violent drug use

shows us that institutionalized racism is
alive and well in colorblind America.
Last week the NAACP released a report
entitled "Misplaced Priorities: Over
Incarcerate, Under Educate." It shows in
detail how the prioritization of ineffective
punitive criminal justice strategies over
quality education has undermined poor
urban communities. The angle is smart

and the argument powerful, but equally
important and compelling is the impact
of today's system in exacerbating violent
crime. Today's drug policy not only creates an underground market that advan-

tages thugs and drives desperate addicts
to crime, it wastes invaluable resources
that could go toward protecting people
from real dangers from fists, knives and
guns.

Whether you're a radical member of
the new Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS) or a principled conservative, the
racism, inefficiency and moral bankruptcy of our criminal justice system should
appall you. That marijuana is illegal but
handguns and assault weapons given special legal protection should strike you as
not just bizarre, but disgusting.
Those looking for a concrete enemy in

Each of the above paragraphs are tiny worlds of stories, the type of thing that to an improv comedian can
materialize into a rich and funny scene. There's depth,
suspense, conflict, and most importantly, real people.
Improv scenes can last a few seconds, a few minutes, or
sometimes over a half an hour. While there's a considerable amount of skill that goes into improvising and
even more guts, at the heart of every improv scene are
two elements that if grasped by an athlete could pay
major dividends : a concrete set of rules and a whole lot
of practice.
In his book "Blink," Malcolm Gladwell looks at our
brain's ability to make snap judgments from a variety of
angles, one of which is through the lens of improv and
sport, he writes:
"Improv is an art form governed by a series of rules
and they want to make sure that when they're up
onstage, everyone abides by those rules. 'We think of
what we're doing as a lot like basketball' [the improv
comedians] said, and that's an apt analogy. Basketball is
an intricate, high-speed game filled with split-second,
spontaneous decisions. But that spontaneity is possible
only when everyone first engages in hours of highly
perfecting their
repetitive and structured practice
shooting, dribbling, and passing plays over and over
and over again
and agrees to play a carefully defined
role on the court. This is a critical lesson of improv too."

What game on does is to conduct mini improv workshops. Why they're there is because they've figured out
improv's relationship to sports and are experts at teaching it. Each session is a grouping of games where the
athletes are challenged to think like an improv comedian, something that most of them aren't aware that
they're already doing, but more where thereal learning
occurs is in the actual rules of improv.

But the Birmingham, Ala., native

Instead, she used it as a tool to address

Last spring proved to be a pivotal
time for Lupardus. Following the

"and to let their own voices be heard,
if not to the people that were there
but to themselves."
Lupardus, a senior psychology
major, used a program created at the
University of Tennessee's athletic
department as a model to put her idea
into
action. Tennessee's
Team
Enhance, a comprehensive program
comprised of clinicians, social service
workers, physicians, athletic trainers
and coaches helps female athletes
recover from mental health disorders
and injuries.
She then approached senior associate director of Athletics Alana
Shanahan, who put her in contact
with Counseling and Psychological
Services deputy director Denise
Lenksy and director of the Center for
Sports Psychology, Joel Fish. The
group worked together and created a
message to present to leaders ofathletic teams.
"Jessie really played a pivotal role
and just took so much initiative,"
Lenksy said. "She was just really
instrumental in speaking from her
experience as a member of a team
here, just having such valuable perspective on what would be the most
important kernels of information we
could impart in a brief concise for...

mat."
Lupardus said she believes the phi-

losophy invoked in sports cliches like
"suck it up" and "no pain no gain" may
be effective on the court or the field,
but is detrimental in dealing with personal problems.
"They get you through conditioning
when all you have is adrenaline and
lactic acid; they work. But when that
extends outside the boundary of the
field or the court, that's when its dangerous," she said.
"We'll think that we can handle it
and be Superman and suck it up and
do it because that's part of the essence
of being a great athlete. But you can't
suck up psychological symptoms."
According to Lensky, there is an
obstacle associated with the fact that
athletes want to "keep things within
the team."
Fish, who has worked with the
Penn athletic community for 11 years,
had a good feel for the culture and also
provided information about the effects
of depression in athletes.
Ultimately, the message presented
at the monthly team leaders meeting
consisted of a need for visibility, validation and support of student-athletes
suffering from these mental health
issues.
According to Lupardus, once the
silence surrounding these issues is
broken, athletes can then seek external resources and gain the support of

April 14,2011

their teammates and coaches.
Following the presentation to the
student-athletes in October, Lupardus
and her colleagues were given the
opportunity to speak at a coaches
meeting in November.
"I think the fact that the athletic
department was willing to take hold of
this idea and run with it and be fully
supportive was definitely a testament
to the fact that people here care," she
said.
Neither Lupardus nor Lensky are
aware of any increased student-athlete
participation at CAPS, but both said
they feel the message was wellreceived by its intended audience.
Lupdardus will graduate in May
and may continue working on this
project before attending graduate
school. She said she hopes people both
inside and outside the Penn community will continue to embrace her message.
"You can see what silence does, we
can learn from it. We can learn from
[Owen's] silence and speak out now.
And I hope that people take that to
heart. I hope we have no other athletes
that commit suicide," she said.
"It really is indicative of how hard
it is to be a Penn student and an athlete and what these pressure situawe
tions can do. We're only human
hate to admit that as athletes, but
we're human."

Lacrosse teams face difficulty against Diplomats
BY DANIEL DUNCAN

dduncanl@swarthmore.edu

Both the Swarthmore men's and women's lacrosse

teams suffered tough Centennial Conference losses

this weekend, as each fell to Franklin and Marshall.
The losses put the Garnet in a tough position for
making the conference playoffs.
The women looked strong going into the weekend,
demolishing Wesley 21-1 L After a tight first 20 minutes, the Garnet went on a 9-1 run to close the first
half and take a 14-6 lead into the locker rooms. The
lead only grew in the second half.
Several players put up staggering offensive numbers, led by 10 points from Annalise Penikis 'l3. She
scored five goals while adding five assists. Marie
Mutryn 'l2 had eight points off four goals and four
assists. Corinne Sommi 'l4 (five), Nicole Vanchieri
'l3 (four), Emily Evans 'll (two) and Beth Martin 'l3
(one) also got the ball in the net for the Garnet.
But the offensive show ran into trouble against
one of the top-ranked teams in the country, as then#7 F&M ran over the Garnet 20-9. The Garnet fell to
8-4, 2-3 CC, while the Diplomats improved to 12-1, 6-0
CC.
After falling behind early 5-0, the Garnet fought
their way back into contention by scoring three of
the next five goals in the game. But F&M, led by six
goals from Erin Dunne, pulled away towards the end
of the first half, and held a 17-5 lead late in the game.
Swarthmore went on a 4-0 run, but it was too little,
too late to pull off the comeback.
Sommi led the offense with three goals, helped by
two goals each from Mutryn and Evans. Penikis had
a goal and three assists to continue her steller season. Her 31 assists this season rank in the top five
season totals in school history
and the Garnet
have four games to go. Penikis' 77 points on the season rank in the top 10 in school history.
"Though F&M is one of the best teams nationally,
they are definitely beatable," Caroline Murphy 'l4
said. But she added that although the "team did a lot
of things well Saturday, such as transitioning the
ball to the offensive end of the field," the Garnet "did
not play to the best of our ability, and the score
reflected that."
Last night, the Garnet traveled to Muhlenberg to
try to keep their playoff hopes alive, suffering a
tough 15-7 loss. Penikis and Sommi led the offense
with two goals apiece.
The Garnet men took to the pitch against F&M in
possibly their ugliest game this year, falling to the
Diplomats 11-5 on Senior Day. Swarthmore fell to 3-8,
1-4 CC, a loss that all but eliminates them from the
Centennial playoff chase.
It was a disappointing final home game, and
Richard Brode 'll said it was a bittersweet moment.
"The requirements of such a physically demanding
sport coupled with this school's notorious academic
requirements have been at times incredibly rewarding and incredibly frustrating."
"I have always cherished the opportunity to play
for my teammates," Brode said, but he feels "mixed
emotions that I've represented Swarthmore as an
institution, due in large part to a student body and
administration that is seemingly apathetic towards
athletics in general."
The Diplomats jumped out to an 8-0 lead by the
third quarter. Until Steve Selverian 'l3 got the
Garnet on the board about halfway through the quarter, Swarthmore had given up 12 unanswered goals, a
streak dating back to their loss to McDaniel last

fray.

April 14, 2011

After trading a series of goals for an 11-3 score in
the fourth quarter, the already physical game took a
turn for the worse. An earlier scuffle among players
that the referees didn't penalize gave way to a minor
fight after some hard fouls from Garnet players. As a
stick went flying, players gathered and the situation
threatened to escalate before the referees took over.
After the refs sorted out what happened, five
penalties were handed out in all, including an ejection for an F&M player who left the bench to join the

The Garnet offense enters the defensive zone of the Franklin
by a score of 11-5.

Everything turned out for the best though, as the
Garnet seemed to be a little energized after the skirmish, going on a 2-0 run to close out the game. But
the improved second-half performance was overshadowed by the other events of the half.
Max Hubbard 'l2 had two goals to lead the Garnet
offense. On defense, Geli Carabases 'l4 led the way
with four caused turnovers.
Brode said the game reflected how injury-depleted
the Garnet are. "Our offense played with a sense of
anxiety, leading to an uncharacteristic amount of
unforced turnovers and other errors," he said. "On
the defensive end we came out in a zone which
proved ineffective against their feeding oriented
offense."

Marshall Diplomats. The Diplomats defeated the Garnet

"We lacked the intensity and drive that it takes to
win a conference game," Aaron Stein 'll said. While
disappointed with how Senior Day went, he concluded nonetheless that "I would not trade my lacrosse
experience for anything."
The Garnet traveled to Drew University last night
in a non-conference matchup. But Swarthmore
found no love outside of the Centennial either, as
Drew pulled away late in the third quarter to a 9-5
win over the Garnet. Max Hubbard led the offense
with two goals.
Swarthmore plays away this weekend, traveling
to Dickinson College in a Centennial Conference
matchup. The men face-off at 12 p.m., while the
women follow at 3 p.m.

Baseball defeats Hopkins and Washington, third in CC

History

has been made, the
Centennial Conference is on alert and
the 2011 Swarthmore College baseball
team has boldly gone where no Garnet
ballclub in recent memory has gone
before. Roaring back from a rough fourgame stretch against Gettysburg and
Haverford, Swarthmore turned the
Conference on its ear by sweeping the
nationally-ranked Johns Hopkins Blue
Jays in a doubleheader on Sunday, and
finished off a two-game season sweep of
the Washington Shoremen on Monday.
With a 16-8 overall record and a 7-3
Conference record, the team is tied with
Hopkins and is just one gamebehind coConference leaders Haverford and
Franklin & Marshall.

all I have to do is throw one

His record-tying save was perhaps
the biggest of the year, as the dormant
Hopkins bats had started to stir, putting
the go-ahead run on base against a tiring Rodriguez. "As I got warm in the
bullpen, I could tell I didn't have my A+

his consistent domination by shutting

Conference.
"He has to be in the conversation [for

Stan Exeter said. "He's our top guy, and
we're one of the top teams, so he has to

"I've always had the confidence that
I could be an effective starter,"
Rodriguez said. "I'm flattered that people are ... thinking of me [as a top starting pitcher, but] personally, I think I
need to improve greatly in certain parts
of my game."
He claims that his numbers, however
exemplary they are, are not his primary

"These were two great wins for the

"But [Monday's game] was really the
one that helped us in the standings."
On Monday at Washington, the
offense picked up where it left off,
pounding out thirteen hits to rout the
Shoremen, 13-4. McTear, Burnett and
first baseman Mike Cameron 'l2 each
had three hits; Burnett and McTear
both drove in three runs.
Waterhouse went 2-for-5 to raise his
average to .394, fifth-highest in the
Conference. McTear stole his 13th base

Centennial. Starter Neil Mejia 'l2

six over nine innings.
The win moved Swarthmore past
Washington in the standings and into a
tie for third place.
While obviously pleased with the
winning streak, the team knows that

the stretch run is still ahead, and that
dwelling on past victories is not an
option.

"We still have a lot [of games] left,"
Exeter said. "[But] we're fielding
incredibly these last five or six games,
compared to where we were. We need to
continue to pitch like we are and field
like we are."

"I think [the wins] solidify us as a
real force, not only in the Centennial
Conference but also in the region,"
Rodriguez said. "We can't dwell on what
happened last week, though. We need to
continue playing good baseball. It's

Morgan Langley signs with Harrisburg Islanders

Parker Murray, Jakob Mrozewski and Olivia Natan Phoenix Staff

BY ANA APOSTOLERIS
aapostol@swarthmore.edu

As a first-year in 2007, forward Morgan Langley 11 didn't start a single game for the
Swarthmore College men's soccer team. In 2008, he worked his way into the starting
lineup for the majority of the season, recording the sixth-highest single-season assist
total in program history. He broke out his junior year, scoring 31 points (second alltime) and 14 goals (fourth all-time), resulting in Centennial Conference First Team and
All-Region Second Team honors. Langley's swan song last season earned him AllConference, All-Region and All-America recognition, and now he's taken his game to
yet another level, signing a professional contract with the Harrisburg City Islanders.
"Every kid that starts playing a sport dreams to one day play that sport professionally," Langley said, who holds Swarthmore's school records for career points (95), career
assists (27) and single-season points (42). "It feels awesome. I'm very excited."
The Islanders are theUSL Pro affiliate of the Philadelphia Union, a major league soccer team. As a member of the Islanders, Langley will be eligible for a call-up to the
Union at any point during the season.
The Langley-led Garnet has made NCAA tournament appearances in each of the past
three seasons. During his four years at Swarthmore, the team has won more games
than in any other four-year period in program history.
Langley counts the recent turn of events as something of a surprise, as he considered
his competitive soccer career to be on the wane. "In the fall and early spring I was interviewing for financial firms and banks. I was driving to [New York] and interviewing on
Wall Street," the Honolulu native said. "I thought that's what was in store for me."
It was his coach, Eric Wagner, who set the chain in motion by initiating contact with
the Union. Wagner, who has guided Swarthmore's soccer program since 2002, called
Langley "one of the best players I've been privileged to work with."
"I'm thrilled to see that the work we have done together has helped [him] develop to
the point where he was able to get... offered a contract," he said. "It's a wonderfulaffirmation of our player development; and of our program as a whole." Langley is the second Swarthmore player to be signed professionally this year, as Ladule Lako Lo Sarah
'O9 signed with a Ist Division Macedonian team in the fall of 2010.

Swarthmore's reputation for a low-key athletic environment geared towards player
development was what attracted Langley to the school in the first place. "I was small [as
a first-year] and wouldn't be able to play [regularly] with a [Division I] school," he said.
"They would not [have allowed] me that time to develop. Dili allowed me to grow and
develop as a player at the perfect pace for me."
Ironically, he viewed his choice of a Division 111 school as mutually exclusive with a
professional future. "[Playing professionally] was definitely not a goal coming into college," Langley said. "I looked at choosing a Dili school as basically saying goodbye to
such a dream. But it turned out that [it was] what I needed."
According to Adam Hertz, Swarthmore's Director of Athletics since 2001, Langley
made the most of the opportunities he was given to develop as a player and as a person.
"I think what has been so special about Morgan's development at Swarthmore has been
his overall maturation," Hertz said. "He ... learned to recognize what was and was not
in his control, [and] he became a stronger, more disciplined player who worked better
as a member ofhis team."
Langley's journey to the pros began in December, when Langley said Wagner contacted the Union about playing possibilities for the soon-to-be graduate. He was invited
to a joint tryout with the Union and the Islanders, where he was tagged as a prospect of
interest. After a month and a half of weekly tryouts, he was invited to the Islanders' preseason to compete for a spot on the team with other prospects whom Langley referred
to as "high quality players." He was offered a contract midway through the preseason
schedule.
His departure will leave a significant hole in the Garnet lineup, which has relied on
him heavily for the past two seasons. "Teams-, I believe, regularly planned their defenses around Morgan," Hertz said. "His speed and ability to take a game over were a constant distraction to the opposition."
Wagner called the signing bittersweet. "We've invested lots of time and energy and
emotion to help Morgan achieve a level of ability, maturity and mental tenacity that
has put him in a position to be one of the best players in the country," he said. "Now we
have to say goodbye to him and let someone else enjoy his talents. But that's what our
program is all about."
The Islanders open their regular season schedule on Saturday, April 16.
