Taking a swing at a
new way of slotting

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Two years after football cuts, more sports get more slots in every
incoming class. How have athletics changed? By Matthew Fitting

Baseball

coach Frank Agovino remembers certain
away games a few years ago when a single injury
would have forced his team to forfeit.
Agovino would lead a team of exactly nine baseball
players to places like Washington College. He offered a
hint for those not up on their baseball: "You need at least
nine to play," he said.
His problem, he explained, had nothing to do with his
roster. The problem was attitude. A few years ago, too few
students were devoted enough to baseball to spare the time
for a trip to a game at a college several hours away at least
once a week during spring semester.
But those days are over, at least for now. And after eight
and believes
it will
years as coach, Agovino hopes
stay that way. His players now "are more serious about the
sport," and last year the full roster of 22 students almost
always traveled to away games. His teams from a few years
ago consisted mainly of walk-ons, while his roster now
consists mainly of recruits.
Now, according to Agovino, "a different breed of student
athlete" takes the field for the Garnet Tide baseball team.
"Slotting has done that for us," he said. "Slotting has
given us a direction, a positive direction."
He concedes his team's change doesn't show in records.
"Our record [last year] wasn't better than many other
years, but our team was different," he said. "The games are
quicker, the scores are closer."
A few years ago, when baseball received no slots,
Agovino's hands were tied when trying to get talented
baseball players to come to Swarthmore. "We could still
attempt to recruit," he said. "But when push came to shove
there was nothing we could do."
The baseball team's experience does not reflect those of
all sports at Swarthmore. The field hockey and women's
cross country teams, for example, won Centennial
Conference championships in 1996 and 1997, during days
when the football team received more slots than any other
team, and field hockey and cross country got fewer slots
than they do today. Field hockey took the conference
championship in 1995, as well.
But after the decision to cut football in December of 2000,
slotting at Swarthmore changed significantly in both the
admissions office and athletics department, andathletics has
changed along with it. Slotting guarantees a certain percentage of applicants a boost in the admissions process. The athletics department decides which applicants get that boost.
Fifteen percent of every incoming freshmen class is
now slotted or given preference, as the pthletics department says
which translates to roughly 55 students out of
this year's class of 375.
And though 18 percent of applicants were slotted before
cutting football, many of those slots went to the football
team. So despite the percentage drop, cutting football has
meant more players for more teams.
Now, all 21 NCAA Division 111 varsity teams at
Swarthmore get at least one slotted student. Before the
cuts, only 12 teams per year were allowed slots in the
admissions process. Those 12 teams were meant to change
every year, resulting in each team getting a roughly equal
number of players over the years. Most agreed, however,
that the system failed to benefit everyone equally.
The new system's goal is to field more competitive
teams in every sport. For Agovino "competitive" means a
student athlete at Swarthmore should expect to compete
for a playoff spot or a conference championship in at least

one season during their athletic career. "I think if a coach

tells you he doesn't want to win, he's probably lying to
you," he said. "In our worst year we want to break .500 and

be competitive."

Despite only one year of existence, and a common
refrain among many athletic officials that it's "still early"
in the process, many in theLamb Miller Field House share
Agovino's optimistic attitude that this kind of competitiveness is now possible for teams that struggled during

the football years. The redistribution of slots is one of the
main reasons why.

DEFINING SUCCESS

Associate Athletic Director Adam Hertz knows success
he saw it, in
in Swarthmore athletics when he sees it
fact, just last Saturday.
The women's soccer team, after 12 straight previous
defeats, topped rival Gettysburg College 1-0, and made
Hertz a very happy man.
"That I consider a step in the right direction," Hertz
said, jabbing his finger in the air. "Now we're starting to
beat the teams we need to beat."
When the Athletics Review Committee decided almost
two years ago to cut the football and wrestling teams and
make badminton an intramural sport, they cited making
Swarthmore sports stronger on the whole as one of their

main objectives.
October 3, 2002

"The goal all along was to strengthen the program,"
said Jim Bock '9O, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid,
and the key non-athletics official involved in the redistribution of slots. "But this decision let us strengthen the
whole program, not just one or two teams."

"[Before the cuts], we could all
attempt to recruit. But when push
came to shove, there was
nothing we could do."
Baseball coach Frank Agovino
Though team records have seen little change, mainly

because the new way of slotting has existed for only a year,
many coaches say they're now fielding more competitive

teams

or will be soon.

But different coaches and administrators keep different
opinions of the results a successful Swarthmore sports program should produce.
For Hertz, "the opportunity to go out on the field and
win the game" is key. Records, he agreed, aren't everything. The men's soccer team, he pointed out, had a record

From SLOTTING, pg. 3
of 8-8 last year, its best in about a decade. But they still finished second to last in Centennial Conference standings.
"So I don't consider that successful," he said. "But I con-

sider it development."
For Agovino, the old adage may not be true. "Who
shoots for mediocrity in this whole place? Everybody tries
to be the best, and we should too."
Athletics Director Bob Williams and Bock almost
repeated each other when asked about what success means
for Swarthmore sports.
"Competitive means that every time a Swarthmore
sports team takes the field, the court, the pool, they feel
they have the same opportunity for success as their opponent," vVilliams said. "Then we're offering our students a
worthwhile experience."

as a department... so is everybody else."
The refusal to award athletic merit scholarships, he
said, does make things difficult. "When push comes to
shove, [prospective student athletes] just get a better package from our peer schools, and they're just better packages
we can't offer."
Women's soccer coach Amy Brunner agreed. "Other
schools can often tell them, 'Yeah, I can get you in,'" she
said. The college's unwillingness to guarantee admission
can make it "hard to drag these kids along," she added.
But, she pointed out, the new slotting system has
improved her team so enough to change her recruiting

method. "Sometimes I have to choose a student who is not
the one I really love as a person, but who I still think has a
Swat personality," she said. The focus now is more on talent. "There's no sense in me bringing in students who are

just going to add numbers to the bench."
And despite restraints on what she can offer when
recruiting, "I think we all know as coaches here that's
what we're going to get, and that's what makes us
unique."
Agovino echoed her, saying, "I think we have a special
lot of coaches. I don't think there's a coach who doesn't
understand the special mission of the college. They understand its place in American education."
And despite their inability
and perhaps unwillingto employ rival colleges' tactics, Agovino said
ness
most coaches still believe "that we can get where we need
to go, and it can be done."
Williams said he would like "to see all of Division 111
get away from awarding athletic merit scholarships."
Until then, however, Swarthmore athletics will always,
in some ways, be playing a game of catch up.
-

"When our students step on the
field they should feel like that have
a shot at winning."
Dean of Admissions and Fin. Aid.
Jim Bock '9O
"I think when you step on the field the idea is to be able
to be competitive," Bock said. "When our students step on
the field they should feel like they have a shot at winning."
But expectations still differ. While Hertz emphasized
the men's soccer team's second to last finish, Bock got
greater satisfaction from the 8-8 overall record, "their best
year yet," he said.

A QUESTION OF TACTICS

There are days Agovino sits, he said, and wishes.
Looking at his computer screen and an e-mail from one of
the many prospective baseball players he's met with the
past few months, he sees a 1080 SAT score, a 23 on the ACTs
and a solid "B" average.
At some colleges in the Centennial Conference, an athletically talented student with those numbers would meet
with almost automatic admission. Moreover, some schools
are rumored Williams stresses these are just rumors
to be in the habit of offering eleventh-hour "academic"
merit scholarships to certain student-athletes they're particularly determined to bring to campus.
Williams recognized "we do have some catching up to
do in their terms of that experience" of active recruiting.
And along with the new redistribution of slots, all varsity team coaches will be full time by the start of next fall
semester
a step long employed at rival colleges, and long
needed at Swarthmore, many in athletics said. This way,
"[Coaches] spend more time actively recruiting, so we're
generating more exposure to our school," Hertz said.
Williams pointed to coaches getting off campus more to
recruit as a step in the right direction, as well as his
department's new ability to bring especially coveted
prospective students to campus for an overnight stay and
admissions interview.
"This is all new ground for us," he said. "It's difficult
trying to decide how much of that we should do."
And Hertz added that, despite recent abilities given athletics to recruit, to slot for more sports "It's a difficult

position to work from."

Williams was hesitant when asked how far Swarthmore
should go when it comes to recruiting. "I think we need to
keep up," he said. "We need to remain competitive. And
who's to say down the road we won't be awarding aid for

athletic merit?"
Questions like these are driving a possible future split
in Division 111, Williams said, between those schools willing to award athletic scholarships and those not. "We're
not as like-minded as we used to be," he said.
Swarthmore would probably join the latter group, and
no matter what happens to Division 111, will always play in
the Centennial Conference.
But while certain tactics at other colleges might result
as well as days when
in stronger athletic programs
Agovino and others might wish they were used here
many in athletics said these methods won't, and shouldn't,
come to Swarthmore.
"We're keeping academic standards," Agovino said,
despite the current climate. "We are getting more aggressive

PRESENT AND FUTURE

Despite several changes to the system, one important
element remains: coaches and the athletics administration decide which teams receive how many slots every
year, not Bock and the admissions office.
So Bock, in Parrish, worries about different things
than the coaches sitting across campus in Lamb Miller.
His admissions office focuses more on numbers, on how
his office and athletics can work together to meet the
Board of Managers' mandate from two years ago to cap
slots at 15 percent of every incoming class.
But the difference in the number of slots and teams
that receive slots is showing already. "The freshmen are
making a large impact on every sport this fall," Hertz said.
Freshmen have been starting for both the men's and
women's soccer teams, and producing results.
Agovino, for one, applauded Bock's efforts to make athletics as strong as possible within the room he's given.
"He understands the balance we need to keep," he said. "I

tasks has been to oversee the redistribution of slots.
think he didn't sacrifice anything" with the admitted
class last year.
Brunner recalled the process from a year ago of deciding which teams got how many slots as non-contentious.
"I don't remember a lot of issues, but as long as we know
we're all trying to do what's best for the program, yeah,
we might get short changed one year, but they'll come
back to us," she said. "We all just have to hold on and
believe in the system for that to work."
Every athletics official emphasized there was no ill
will in distributing last year's slots.
"Nobody was especially unhappy with the number they
were given," Hertz said, adding, "This is new for everybody down here
the coaches, too. So we're trying to
adjust accordingly."
But though Hertz appreciates the new system, and
likes the control it gives athletics, he thinks sports are
still too undervalued as a strength in the admissions
process. "You can have a soccer player with a 1540 and an
oboe player with a 1540 on the SATs," he said. "And I think
until we recognize athletics as a viable extracurricular
activity
we're going to have to use the slots for that."
Despite the positive results, Hertz expressed a desire
for even more progress. "There's a number in my head
that's more than fifteen percent," he said when asked if he
was completely satisfied with the current percentage of
slots. "We would need double the number we get now to be
...

very successful.
"Do I think we can do it with the numbers we get now?
Yes, I think so."

Committee on living wage to convene soon
Campaign worried about staff representation and harassment as Ad Hoc committee forms
BY AVIVA ARON-DINE

aarondil@swarthmore.edu
When the administration raised the
staff minimum wage to $9 per hour last
spring and agreed to form an Ad Hoc
Committee on a living wage, the Living
Wage Campaign experienced its first major
triumph. Now, campaign members are
once again fighting, this time for their
vision of what the committee should be,
while grappling with cases of what they
call harassment of staff.
According to psychology professor Barry

Schwartz, who will co-chair the Ad Hoc
Committee, the committee hopes to assemble
soon after October break. Members will
include Schwartz, Associate Vice President
for Human Resources Melanie Young, three

or four staff members to be selected by the
Staff Advisory Committee (through an application process), three or four students students to be selected by Student Council and
three additional faculty members. The mandate of the committee is, in Schwartz's
words, "not to evaluate whether a living
wage is a good idea in principle but to examine how to do it in practice."
Campaign members have high hopes for
the committee process. "We're students
and staff and we don't have access to budgets and hard numbers," Chela Delgado 'O3
said. "It's exciting that the committee will
be looking at this issue with the real information in hand."
For some campaign members, however,
ongoing concerns about harassment of staff
overshadow excitement over the committee.

In one incident this year, an unknown individual created fake business cards for a staff
member involved in the living wage campaign. The cards, which were marked with a
graphic of a witch on a broomstick, attacked
the person's involvement with the Living
Wage Campaign and referred to the staff person as "a bitter old" person with "half a brain."
According to Delgado, who runs the campaign's weekly meetings for staff members,
this was not an isolated incident. "I wish
with all my heart that the director of human
resources could hear what I hear down
here," Delgado said. "Everyone looks at me
and sees me as this student who's exaggerating the situation, [but] staff fear is real."
Al Bradbury 'O5, another student
involved in the campaign, described several incidents she heard about from individ-

uals

involved. "One staff member last

semester was told by his supervisor not to
go to the [living wage] rally," she said.
Another staff member told her he got in
trouble for talking to a campaign member

during working hours.

Bradbury and Delgado both view the
college as unresponsive to the issue of staff
harassment. "We've had a series of meetings with Al Bloom and [recently] with

A revamped Paces
promises more for
the coming year
BY JULIA POM PETTI
jpompetl@swarthmore.edu

Time, motion and food: this is the theme of the new
mural being created for Paces.
Co-directors Carmen Barron 'O5 and Jon Fombonne
'O5 wanted to create a colorful, clean and comfortable
space, so last year they requested funding to renovate
Paces, revamping its worn appearance.
Barron and Fombonne, who were hired as co-directors of Paces last April, had both previously worked
there as staff members. Last year there was little they
could do due to limited time. As Barron explained, "You
can't change a horse mid-race."
But both have worked behind the scenes to make
sure the grand opening of the cafe at 10 p.m. this Friday
is something everyone can get excited about.
A Paces revamp has been attempted before. In
September of 2000 The Phoenix reported on the "new
image" ofPaces cafe nights. It involved hiring a hip and
more service-conscious staff and offering more appetizing food.
Now Paces jobs are practically fought over and come
with an undeniable cool quotient. "A lot of people
applied," Barron confirmed. But those dying to join the
scene should not despair, she added. "We rehire every
semester."
Despite the improvements made since 2000, Paces

Rugby team tries to make
amends through workshops
BY PREETY SIDHU

ssidhul@swarthmore.edu

Seeking to restore their image and give back to the
campus community, the men's rugby team has joined
forces with the Dean's Office to put together a freshman
workshop on responsible drinking.
"I decided it was time to revamp and update the alcohol education," Dean of Student Life Tedd Goundie said.
"We need to get a better sense of the drinking culture on
campus and respond to it." In previous years, responsible
drinking has been left to RAs to discuss with their halls
at the beginning of the year. The idea now, however, is
that a more focused workshop will better serve students,
teaching them about Swarthmore's drinking policies as
well as when and how to drink responsibly.
The rugby players, who will facilitate these workshops, plan to emphasize the acceptability of choosing
not to drink and to focus on the secondary repercussions
of alcohol abuse.
"The rugby team experienced first-hand the secondhand effects of drinking," team member Randy Goldstein

THE PHOENIX

'O5 said. Last year, during its spring banquet, the team
inflicted approximately $lOOO worth of damage to Paces,
mostly in graffiti and broken windows and light fixtures.
The team had to pay for the damages out of its own pocket and has faced official sanctions from the college. They
are on probation this semester and not allowed to use college facilities for team social events.
Darryl Smaw, dean of multicultural affairs, suggested
an educational component to the team's sanctions.
Captains Manu Pradhan 'O3 and Axel Neff 'O3 volunteered for team members to head the workshops. They
have tried to make them less of a sanction and more of a
benefit to all involved. "The rugby team admitted respon-

sibility and wanted to do something to help the community," Goundie said. Goldstein, along with Bill Wanjohi
'O5 and team president Brett Klukan 'O3, volunteered to

lead the program.
The workshops are scheduled for the week of October
20, National Alcohol Awareness Week. In future years
they will likely be held earlier in the fall semester, but

hasn't been able to shake its reputation for a slightly

dingy and sleepy atmosphere. Barron and Fombonne

took on the mission of

turning the Paces cafe into

an

energetic mix of entertainment, socializing and distracted studying. Fombonne envisions a swanky "jazz
bar atmosphere."

His plan includes a bright new mural that will cover
all four walls of the room. Studio art professor Randall
Exon counseled Barron and Fombonne on what to look
for in mural applicants. The mural has to walk the

tightrope between "interesting" and "not distracting,"
Barron said. The goal is to end up with a piece that is
"not boring by senior year," Fombonne added.
Tim Applebee 'O3, Jake Beckman 'O4, Melinda Lee 'O4
and Rajaa Shakir 'O4 presented a dynamic proposal that
got them chosen for the project. They are now hard at
work painting the walls. The specifics of the mural are
a secret until the unveiling at the grand opening, but
the artists' credentials are promising.

Students in D.C. protest IMF policies
group as opponents of "corporate" globalization.

BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
ewrightl@swarthmore.edu

About 25 Swarthmore students spent a sunny Saturday
in the streets and squares of Washington, D.C, attempting
to call the attention of world economic leaders to the
harms these students think are inflicted on people in poor
nations by institutions such as the World Bank and IMF.
While the architects of structural adjustment policies
and those who decide how poor nations should pay back
their debts to industrialized nations met at the tightly
secured IMF Headquarters near Farragut Sqaure, mem-

bers of the Swarthmore Progressive Action Coalition
(SPAC) joined with several thousand others in protest.
Backs to the Washington Monument, standing on
patchy grass, protestors participated in a rally that featured a speech by Ralph Nader. Later, they took part in a
permitted march towards Farragut Square. Jessie O'Brien
'O3 said the scene had a peaceful, carnival-like atmosphere.
Some protestors held signs that read, "Disease and
starvation will not be solved by corporations." Others,
including Kim Bussey 'O4, chanted in "radical cheerleader" style: "It's time to say what, IMF goodbye, we're
sick of seeing our world sold out. Take to the streets,
scream and shout. Say break it down, mass exploitation,
break it down, human degradation." O'Brien held a sign
that read simply, "Mindfulness."
About 15 counter-protestors dressed in red, white and
blue gathered to one side of the rally on the other side of
the Washington Monument. Some held signs pointing to
"anti-Americans over there" and proclaiming, "I love capitalism."
Black-clad, bandana-wearing radical anarchist groups
also had a presence at the rally.
Bussey and O'Brien both said the rally, though smaller
than other similar protests, remained focused on its stated
target
international economic injustices.
Protesting the IMF and the World Bank is often equated with an anti-globalization stance. But O'Brien said it is
more accurate to characterize most in the Swarthmore

"Globalization is an economic phenomenon of the
world becoming more interdependent," he said. "I don't
see why that in and of itself is a problem. The problem is
that the people who are directing the process of globalization in such a way that it benefits a small number of very
wealthy people in the U.S. and Western Europe at the
expense of billions of people around the world."
As the marchers moved toward their intended ending
point in Farragut Square, Bussey said. "There was a tense
moment." While the crowd of protestors gathered in the
square, preparing for another rally closer to the IMF headquarters, severalof the protestors set effigies of bankers on
fire. "That got the police upset," Bussey said.

"It's scary to watch as police in riot
gear begin to surround an area and
you don't know how to get out."
Kim Bussey 'O4
Police had already blocked off the two intersections of
Farragut Square that led towards the IMF building. Then
police started to barricade two other entrances, according
to Bussey and O'Brien. "It's scary to watch as police in riot
gear begin to surround an area and you don't know how
you're going to get out," Bussey said. Fearing that the
police would surround the whole square, the group from
Swarthmore retraced their steps and left the city.
"It seemed to me fairly confrontational to try to surround the protestors," O'Brien said.
No police confrontation occurred in the square that
afternoon, though D.C. police had made 649 arrests the previous day in connection with another protest.
[There have been problems at a few protests SPAC has
attended in the past. Students at the A-16 event in 2000
were caught up in conflict between protestors and police,

who used tear gas. Last February, police arrested three
SPAC members protesting at the World Economic Forum
in New York City.
Before the protest, Bussey said, "I'm feeling fine about
it. Some of the people who haven't been to large protests
before are nervous, but that's natural."
O'Brien has two major objections to the policies ofboth
the World Bank and the IMF. "The first objection is that
they require their debtor countries to pay the debt back all
the time, even when that causes massive humanitarian
problems as it does in Africa," he said. "Also, their structural adjustment policies make human and economic aid
contingent on restructuring the economy in various ways
such as privatizing industries and utilities."
"It's a difficult issue," Bussey said. "Probably many of
the people who work for the IMF think they are doing
good."
Though opposition to the World Bank and IMF might be
widespread on campus, it is not the only view. No students
interviewed for this article, however, were willing to discuss views they perceived as contrary to those held by the
majority of students on the record.

Some students doubted protestors would achieve their
intended end through disruptive tactics.
"I have no idea what they are trying to accomplish,"
Elliot Reed 'O3 said. "It seems like the major direct affect
that the protests have is to screw up traffic patterns and
make people irritated at the protestors."
O'Brien defended the value of protest. "I don't know
what the best way to raise these issues is, but it seems like
protest is one way, so why not do it?"
He wondered, however, why this event was smaller
than previous protests he has attended. He said that it

appears that the movement against these international
economic institutions is having some problems. Some in
the movement may be distracted by protesting the proposed war in Iraq, he suggested. He also noted that a lot of
more moderate organizations, such as mainstream labor
organizations, have quietly backed away from the movement, for reasons not entirely clear.

It was standing room only in Kirby
Lecture Hall Tuesday night as students
turned out for Sanjeev Gupta's presentation on the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the poor.
Gupta, assistant director of the Fiscal
Affairs Department of the IMF, delivered a
talk that included an introduction to the
IMF, its mandate, and a look at new initiatives that are designed to acknowledge and
address the problem of poverty.
"Most people," Gupta began, "are
unaware of what the Fund actually does. In
a nutshell, the main focus of the Fund is
essentially on the macroeconomic policies
of member countries." The IMF aims, he
added, "to facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade." Later
in the talk he referred back to the IMF's
mandate when discussing its impact and
its policies regarding the poor.
Gupta also addressed the controversy
that surrounds the IMF, a timely issue in
light of the protests held last week in
Washington, D.C.
"We recognized," he said, "that corruption cuts into government revenues, leads
to wasteful spending, worsens income distribution, and increases poverty." He
emphasized the development of Fund programs that seek to increase focus on gov-

ernment.

The audience exceeded Kirby's 150-person capacity, and met with the approval of
some. "I thought that the lecture was really informative and stimulating," economics professor Steve O'Connell said. "Clearly
there is a lot of interest among the students."
However, not all students present
agreed with or accepted everything that
Gupta said. The audience had many questions. These ranged from requests for clarification about what the IMF does to controversial questions about the IMF's policy-making to the impact of its policies on

member countries' economies and its cur-

New proposals
and decisions
deluge council
BY KRISNA DUONG-LY
kduongll@swarthmore.edu

During Monday night's Student Council (SC) meet-

ing, several major

issues were discussed and debated.

Diversity of opinions sought in new committee
Student Council discussed the appointment of four
students to the Living Wage Committee. Last year,
council was criticized for only selecting individuals
who were highly sympathetic to raising staff wages.
The council agreed that individuals who oppose wage
increases should also be included on the committee. CoPresident Matt Rubin 'O3 stated he felt that no more
than two individuals on the committee should be students who are highly sympathetic to the cause.

Thirteen Swarthmore students joined protestors of all ages from Chester to march for peace last Saturday.

part in Chester peace walk

"Head Start, not Star Wars"
"80% of all U.S. arms exports go to
non-democratic nations"
These were two of the many signs
present at the "Peace in the Streets,
Peace on Earth" march in Chester on
Saturday that struck Pete Mohanty
'O5 as memorable.
For him, they symbolized the purpose of the entire march: to spread the
message that the government is
spending too much money on war and
not enough on general social programs. According to Mohanty, the
U.S. government is "perpetuating violence on an international scale," with
its large military budget and its intention to wage war on Iraq.
For Joanna Taylor 'O5, the most
effective demonstration was a presentation called "A Resounding U.S.
Budget," in which pennies were
dropped into a bucket. Each penny
represented a billion dollars of the
federal government's budget. Taylor
noticed that "social programs got a
few drops into the bucket, but the military's budget went on for a good 30

seconds."
One speaker in particular caught
the attention of Jessica Pope 'O5. "He
talked about the fact that one of the
reasons the United States has such a
large prison complex is that it needs
free labor," she said, "that, in effect,
the prison system is re-institutionalized slavery. By indiscriminately
arresting people from poor communities and placing prisons in those communities, the U.S. government is prof-

iting off of certain parts of the nation
in order to boost the richer, more visible neighborhoods. I thought that his
comments were really compelling,

because he's saying that we have a
system that is oppressive, and it is so
huge that it's hard to point out where
the oppression is happening. This is
where the nation is getting free labor,
this is where the nation is profiting
exploiting certain communities so
other parts have more resources."
these
Saturday
On
three
Swarthmore students, along with 10
others, joined about 200 Chester residents and peace activists in the 3 1/2mile-long peace march in Chester.
The march began at the Islamic

Center of Chester and ended at the
Calvary Baptist Church.
The march drew parallels between
international violence and what participants described as the bloodshed
seen everyday in the streets the participants walked through. As the
group traveled through residential
neighborhoods and business districts,
a stop was made in front of the county's Shelter and Unemployment Office,
and another stop was made at the site
of a recent murder. Taylor said that
speeches made at these stops focused
on how people can end violence and

"turn their lives around." The march
ended with a two-hour rally at the
Calvary Church. This final rally
attracted speakers including Michael
Morrill, the Green Party candidate for
governor of Pennsylvania.
Kelly Kleinert 'O5 was impressed
with the way the march worked to
bring people from different religious,
ethnic and
socioeconomic backgrounds together in solidarity. "The
organizers emphasized how this effort
is really non-denominational," she
said. "I think it helped to break down
barriers between race and classes."
To the students who participated
in the march, the community's warm
response was an encouraging sign of

the event's effectiveness. "I think that

the community really showed how
much power it does have and how
concerned they were about their own
situation," Pope said. "[The march]
seemed to draw in a lot of young people. The older participants also
brought their children."
"The community responded very
well, with people coming out of their
homes and waving as we passed,"
Taylor added.
Mohanty agreed. "They seemed
quite supportive," he said.
Taylor said the group from

Swarthmore was rather small because

the protest in Washington, D.C., against
the International Monetary Fund drew
many students who might otherwise
have attended the march. Mohanty, for
one, decided to give up the opportunity
to attend the IMF protest in order to
join the walk in Chester. "I think that
sometimes, it is more meaningful to go
to small protests
to show your solidarity with local groups and causes," he
said.

Pope agreed, too. "[The march is]
about people coming together trying
to reclaim a certain amount of power
over what happens to them," she said.

"It's the community coming together

to decide what happens to themselves."

Rubin's co-president Ryan Budish 'O4 agreed. "Any
decision will have absolutely no relevance at all and
will not be enforceable at all unless every group feels
that they were fully represented," he said.
"We need people on both sides of the ideological spectrum," Campus Life Representative Joe Dickerson 'O4
said. Council members also discussed reopening the
search for committee members if the first round of applicants consists of only students who are in favor of a living wage. They emphasized the sensitivity of the issue

and its importance to the student body. The Council
hopes to select a committee in the next few weeks.
Some want reading period officially recognized
Budish and Campus Life Representative Ed Stehlik
'O5 brought three proposals to the council's attention.

One involved making reading period less stressful to
students by prohibiting required course meetings and
course exams during the period. The college has failed to
prevent professors from scheduling mandatory course
meetings as well as exams during reading period.
Budish and Stehlik believe the period should be a
time for students to prepare for exams without these

constraints. They acknowledged, however, that activities such as optional review sessions, required seminar
meetings and optional exam times should still be
allowed to take place during reading period. The council voted unanimously to pursue this issue.

Seeking a choice for exam schedules
Budish and Stehlik also proposed that the college
should have self-scheduled final exams. The original
proposal stated that students would pick up their
exams, take their exams individually and return them
to their professors no later than noon the next day.
Stehlik said such a system would allow students to
make travel plans early in the semester, before the
exam schedule is currently posted. It would also solve
the common problems of having three exams in a 25hour period and of having multiple exams either at the
beginning of exam period or at the end of exam period.
Stehlik emphasized the proposal was not a new
honor code. "Having some sort of honor code
isn't at
all like Swarthmore nor it is Quaker," he said. "The goal
is simply to acknowledge that this is any other day."
After several members voiced concerns about cheating, Budish agreed to rewrite the proposal to state that
students must be able to choose one of several time slots
during which to take an exam. Under this new system,
students would take proctored exams in designated
rooms. Newly-elected Secretary/Treasurer Anna Morgan
'O4 proposed that Council delay any voting on the proposal so members would have more time to consider it.

whimsical sculptures, including a giant lawn
chair. The music of The Availables and
Ellipsis will add to the vibrant spirit of the
opening evening. The Availables are a campus group described by Fombonne, who is
also a member, as "Ben Folds Five meets
Guster." They are opening for the alumni
group Ellipsis who feature a fun, soulful combination of guitar, keyboard and vocals.
Along with an assortment of pastries,
cheese and drinks, students will get a first

look at the improved space. The stylish blackand-white mural at the entrance is being
retouched, and a new slate-grey and white
tiled floor has just been installed and waxed.
Brand new gray bucket chairs are ready
to seat students. The benches along the
back wall, a favorite spot for chatting, have
been patched and reinforced. A new bar is
being built, and the stage has been taken
out to provide more room. New lighting
will make it possible to create an atmosphere where the lights are low but the
menu can still be read.
-

Behind the scenes, the kitchen has new
cabinets and a fresh coat of paint.
Unfortunately, the painters were unaware of
the Paces staff tradition of signing the
kitchen wall, and all signatures were lost.
But Barron and Fombonne have pictures of
the autograph wall and will hang them somewhere. This year's staff will start fresh on a
clean wall, continuing the tradition.
Student performances will liven up
weeknights and hopefully bring freshmen
and new customers who might not otherwise have heard about it.

Fombonne promises a wide range of
entertainment: "not just acoustic guitar,"
but something for everyone. A new Web site
is in the works, where students can check
the nightly menu choices and book parties.
The new decor will contribute to the success of wild parties, starting this Saturday
night with the Frisbee team's party and followed by pub nights thrown by the senior

class officers starting next Thursday.
Paces will be open Sundays through
Wednesdays from 9:30 p.m. until 12:30 a.m.,
beginning this Sunday.

have been specifically about staff

harassment [and] they've been less
responsive than I would have hoped,"
Bradbury said.
Eldridge '6l, Swarthmore's vice
president for college and community
relations, assesses the situation differently. "All the staff I know and
encounter are not intimidated," he
said. "In the abstract we [Eldridge
and the Campaign members] did talk
about this as a potential problem, but
in actuality
I don't think that's the
feeling at Swarthmore."
...

The administration did not incorporate the campaign's suggestions for creating what Bradbury referred to as a

"safe space for low wage staff" into Ad
Hoc Committee procedure. The cam-

paign had asked that the committee be
closed to supervisors; instead, it will be
co-chaired by Young, who, as associate
vice president for human resource, is
one of the highest staffofficials.
According to Eldridge, the "human
resources people are staff advocates,
and they would be the first to move to
make staff feel comfortable."
But campaign members disagree.
"It's not that we're against anyone personally," Delgado said. "But it's hard to
talk about what's wrong with your job
when you're sitting next to someone
who has control over your job."
In campaign members' view, the
college has also been unresponsive to
proposals for ensuring low-wage staff
representation on the committee. "We
really wanted to have elections for staff
members," Delgado said. Instead, the
Staff Advisory Committee (SAC) will
appoint members. According to
Delgado, "that's very difficult because
you have this situation where people
who have constant access to e-mail and
computers, people at midlevel, [are
more likely to be appointed]."
Bradbury said that when the campaign took its concerns to the administration, "their response was, 'staff is staff.'"
Eldridge said that SAC could be
relied on to select a diverse group of
representatives and that "low-wage
staff are a part of that mix."
Once members are appointed, the
campaign's next major demand is that

the Swarthmore community be kept
informed of the committee's actions. "If
we can't influence exactly how it happens, it's important that we know exactly what's happening," said Mariah
Montgomery 'O4, one of the campaign's
two co-coordinators. "While I can certainly understand [the committee's]
desire to keep some things quiet
in
my personal opinion ... there need to be
...

real, regular briefings of the community." Increased transparency in all

aspects of college dealings with staff is

one of the campaign's long-term goals.
But according to Schwartz, the campaign may face another defeat on the
transparency issue. "Melanie and I are
leaning towards a view that the commit-

member asked. "As a staff, we have to
advocate for moving people along as
they gain longevity," another said.

tee's work should be confidential," he said.
There is no guarantee that the outcome of choosing committee memebers will satisfy the campaign any
better than the committee's decisions.
"Everyone [involved with the committee] agrees that a world in which lowpaid staff make more money is better,"
Schwartz said. "There's a consensus
but it's not a helpful consensus. The
board at the moment is very concerned
[about the health of the endowment], and
there are two huge and growing expenses: financial aid and benefits." Schwartz
does not think the Board of Managers is
likely to agree to dip into the endowment
to pay for a living wage, so the committee will have to find funds within the
existing budget. If that means deciding
what to cut, Schwartz said, "That's a
conversation I don't relish."
...

"I think we should try to
reduce the problem [of
wage compression]; I
don't think we have to
do that all at once."
Barry Schwartz
Even if funds are found, the question of what exactly to do with them
remains. The Living Wage Campaign
advocates a campus-wide minimum
wage of $l3 per hour. Schwartz noted
that raising wages to that level would
reduce the amount that low-wage staff

members receive through the federal
earned income tax credit by 50 to 75
percent. "[The committee] might
decide on something that costs the
same [as a wage increase]," but is not
distributed through wages, he said.
Living Wage Campaign members,
in response, were skeptical. "Our position on benefits is that benefits are
great [but] it should not be framed as a

trade-off with wages," Delgado said.

"What a lot of people don't know is that
a living wage assumes people already

have benefits." As far as the earned
income tax credit issue goes, she said,
"hopefully the committee will be able
to spend more time exploring that."
At an open informational meeting
held by the campaign in Sharpies last
Friday, staff members voiced their
own concerns about college policies.
Several wondered about the effect of a
living wage

on rewards for seniority.

Schwartz said he understood staff
worries about "wage compression," or

how raising wages at the bottom of the
pay scale may appear to diminish payoffs of seniority. But, he said, "in my
opinion the [previous] committee's, [the
Compensation Review Committee's]
report was overly concerned with this.
The way to respond is educating people
....that because someone else is better
off does not mean that you're worse off."
Schwartz suggested that the committee consider "trickle-up" wage
increases, in which bottom-pay-scale
wages would increase first, followed
by increases higher up the wage scale
when funding became available. "I
think we should try to reduce the
problem [of wage compression]; I
don't think we have to do that all at
once," he said. The committee will
also weigh ideas for "diminishing
increases," increases all along the pay
scale but concentrated at the bottom.
For now, campaign members are
focusing most of their attention on the
committee. "Depending on how many
low-wage staff members are appoint-

ed, that's going to somewhat affect
our response and our program for the
rest of the semester," Delgado said.
The campaign is also working hard to

convince both students and staff to
apply for committee positions. At the
informational meeting in Sharpies,
Delgado told staff, "Everyone should
. People
apply for the committee
with new perspectives are usually the
ones who see things most clearly."
Commenting on campaign relations with staff and on the degree to
which staff members feel the campaign belongs to them, Montgomery
said, "I would say that there have
been high points and low points over
the two and a half years. I think right
now there are a lot of complicated
feelings
We're trying to get the
enthusiasm from last year going
again [after the summer]."
...

....

The campaign just resumed its
weekly meetings for staff in Sharpies.
Between 8 and 15 staff members normally attend these meetings, while
approximately 20 staff members are
on an e-mail list to receive information related to the living wage issue.
The campaign will also continue to
work on getting its message out on
campus. "At U Penn, where staff are
unionized, they are making $l3 or $l4
an hour," Delgado said. "People want
to pretend that the fact that we're not
paying a living wage here isn't a statement

but it is."

not during orientation. "Orientation is packed and the
first-years have no context," Goundie explained.
So far the deans have held two brainstorming sessions, one with the program leaders and one with the
upperclassmen on the rugby team. They have discussed
drinking norms and problems on campus, as well as
workshop goals. The format for the workshop will likely
be modeled after the Acquaintance Sexual Assault

Prevention workshops that are held during or just after
orientation every year.
The rugby team even has a tentative plan to create a counseling group analogous to the Sexual Health Counselors.
Attendance at the workshop will be required for
freshmen and optional for upperclassmen. The program
leaders will soon be recruiting facilitators to work in
pairs with about 20 to 30 freshmen at a time, probably
grouped by halls. The precise approach to presentation
of material has not yet been determined.
Goundie believes the program has four broad goals.
The first is to make it clear to students that it is OK not to
drink. "There are a significant percentage of students on
this campus who don't drink at all," he said. The rugby
team also emphasizes that there are non-drinkers within
its ranks, and hopes that knowing this will alleviate some
of the pressures freshmen might feel to drink at parties.
The second aim is to make sure students have
enough knowledge, so that if they choose to drink, they
are making an informed decision. The third is to help
students make the distinction between responsible and
irresponsible drinking. Lastly, Goundie and the rugby
team want to make sure students can recognize warning signs and know how to get help for themselves or

their friends.
The team also plans to address how to deal with the

secondhand effects of drinking, such as increased
aggression, inappropriate sexual behavior and less serious problems, like vomiting in hallways. They will discuss how to approach a drunk person, and how to attend
parties without feeling the pressure to drink.
Both the deans and team believe that hearing a message
of responsible drinking from rugby players will be especially beneficial to first-years. "Better for us to tell them
than someone who doesn't know," John Turcik 'O5 said.
Klukan agrees. "We understand our reputation on
campus," he said. "The rugby team is apt for this workshop because we do drink and we're not just preaching.
We are a sincere bunch of guys. We want to give back to
the campus, remedy our mistakes, and educate both the
community and ourselves."
"Having them present it lends credibility," Goundie

said. "The message is not coming only from people who
don't drink or who say that alcohol is bad. The rugby
team can testify to the consequences of irresponsible
drinking and identify behavior that shouldn't happen.
It is much more real and Swarthmore-specific."
"I wish a similar program had existed when I was a
freshman," Goldstein said. "I think many freshmen go
overboard in the first few weeks."
"If we can prevent just one person from going to the
hospital with alcohol poisoning," Klukan added, "then
we have accomplished something."

Look at any map of Philly and you'll see four parks prominently placed in the heart of the city. This is Logan Square

10:50 a.m. Geography lesson.

BY RASHELLE ISIP

A GAME OF FOUR SQUARE

Franklin Square
After a brief stop in Chinatown, I set out for the wilds of
Philly's public spaces. While walking east I pass a police horse in
a trailer. His gaze follows me, and when I stop to say "hi" he
looks at me with his big brown eyes. (Now that I look back on it,

I think he might been trying to tell me something ... something
along the lines of: "Don't go that way, sister!") I don't heed his
warning, but keep on going. Coming to a busy intersection, I realize that my horse friend was right. I bet even ol' Ben would be
quite sad to see this park.
I am quite shocked to see a large sign advertising buildings
for lease, scattered debris and homeless people sleeping on the
grass. I get out my camera and attempt to take some photos, but
the batteries are playing tricks on me. Frazzled and frantic, I try
to fix the problem. I don't particularly like the noisy passing traffic or the seemingly bleak Philadelphia Police Department headquarters across the street, or the shifty, sleepy characters in the
park, one of whom just looks at me puzzled and probably wonders what the heck I'm doing there. It is time to go.
As I walk down Bth Street, I come upon the famous
Strawbridge and Clothier department store. I stop in to take a
peek and am rewarded by a cool blast of perfumed air. That is
enough for me. Crossing Market Street, I continue south on Bth.
Soon enough, I enter Jeweler's Row, which is lined with numerous retail and wholesale jewelry (duh) and diamond stores. I try
to take some photos of the storefronts, but the camera is acting
up again (Take my word, there are a lot of stores). I turn left onto
Walnut Street and walk over a few blocks to Washington Square.

Washington Square
Surrounded by office buildings, this park is a little bit more

populated than Franklin Square. There are trees, cobbled paths,
brick walls and assorted benches, and the sun is shining.
Couples are sitting together on benches, people are eating and
reading and relaxing, and two teenaged boys are boxing with
bright red boxing gloves. A police car comes down the walkway
in the park. The officer driving the car waves to the boys, the
boys wave back, and the officer continues on his way.
Everything's all well and good, I suppose. The boys are kind
enough to let me take pictures of them, and I thank them graciously (by this time I was beginning to get a hang of the camera). The only drawback of this park, at the moment, is that it's
undergoing construction. There are some areas that are being
worked on and this somewhat detracts from its charm, in my
opinion.
After struggling with the camera once again, I walk along
Walnut Street, which has an interesting flowing character as you
walk the length of it. Right near Washington Square there are a
lot of hospitals, and people dressed in scrubs and lab coats hustle about. Some people are just getting off of work and rush to
catch their bus. At the same time, students getting off from
school add to the clamor of the street.
But soon, I have entered the more ritzy and glamorous part of

9:00 AM.
Liberty Bell and Independence Hall
opens. Be a complete tourist and
gape at a big, broken bell, just so
you can say that you've seen it.

Walnut street: designer shops, the Forest Theater. Eventually I
cross onto Broad Street (which is really broad, in case you're
wondering) and get a fantastic look at City Hall. Not long after
this, I pass the famous French restaurant Le Bee-Fin. I see the
receptionist/hostess waiting inside, dressed in black and talking
on the phone, and I'm also amazed by the doorbell outside the
door, which you have to ring in order to get in. Pretty snazzy. I
also admire the flags hanging down from the lampposts,
announcing that it's Spinal Injury Awareness Month. Learn
something new each day. After many blocks, I come to
Rittenhouse Square.

Rittenhouse Square
This is the busiest park as of yet in my travels. There are students, people off from work, people talking, eating, lying in the
sun, sitting on benches and just walking around. There are two
painters; one's painting portraits, while the other tries to sell
some landscape works. A long portable table is set up with a sign
near the empty fountain area and some merchants are giving
away free phones (at least that's what they said). Not really interested in that, I continue on and find a gathering of people.
Nothing really earth-shattering here (thank goodness); a few
games of after-work chess are being played by men in dress
shirts and ties. This park's got life to it, not to mention interesting animal sculptures and numerous beds of flowers. There's a
cute little kiosk in the middle of the square and lots of benches.
Just as in Washington Square, there is a cobbled pathway, and
brick walls surround the park.
I continue on Walnut Street, which soon lessens in extravagance and turns into more of a living neighborhood with old
brownstone-like storefronts. I realize I've walked a block over in
my haste, so I turn up 21st Street and walk back over the block I
was supposed to turn onto.
Logan Square
I've now reached the business district of Philly, and I'm getting tired. My feet want a rest, and my hand is numb from holding the camera. Intrepid explorer that I am, however, I push on.
The walk becomes pleasant as I move up 20th Street. It's treelined and is in a somewhat quieter and less frantic area. Coming
up to Logan Square (which has a traffic circle inscribed in it), I

see some familiar landmarks. The Franklin Institute lies on the
west side of the park, the Free Library on the north side, and the
Academy of Natural Sciences on the south side.
The square is a somewhat welcome sight. After timing the
flow of the traffic circle, I venture out into the middle of the
square. There I find a drained fountain; its copper frogs, turtles
and reclining women, now mint-colored, sit silently. The people
are a mix of readers, sunbathers, people in conversation and,
once again, a variety of sleeping figures on the grass. The flowers and the breeze and the sun make for a pretty setting. It's also
neat to feel the world moving around you (well, the traffic anyway) and realize that you're staying in one place.

9:30 AM.
The Franklin Institute opens. Handson scientific fun. Sit in a fighter jet,
ride an old steam engine, or spend
hours staring at whirlpools.

10:00 A.M.
Carpenters Hall opens. History

permeates the site of the First
Continental Congress. Tchotkes
permeate the gift shop.

You can find everything you could conceivably want out
of Philadelphia on 13th street. Or so my friend, who lives at
12th and Pine, claimed. I went out to see for myself.
When most people think of Philly they think of South
Street. I'm no different: all of the funky stores that came to
mind were on or right off of South. But going on the assumption that Phoenix readers aren't interested in the obvious, I
went in search of a new path to blaze.
The blazing began at Rustic Music, a new and used
record shop. Bins outside advertised CDs for as little as $2.

THERE AND BACK AGAIN
BY BENJAMIN KABAK

City

City
Philadelphia is only 15 miles away
from our Ivory Tower of Swarthmore,
but with the limited transportation
options it sometimes seems more like
150 miles.
The most direct way to get "there
and back again" wouldn't be to walk, as
Bilbo Baggins does. Instead, it's best to
drive. Incidentally, this is also the
fastest way to get to Philly. You can be
there in about 20 to 25 minutes depending on the traffic. If you have a car,
you're in luck, or if you or one of your
friends is van-certified, the college will
rent you a van for $0.50 a mile.
My favorite way to drive is to take
the Blue Route to 1-95 North.

Eventually, you'll run across lots of
exits for Philadelphia, and it all really
depends on where you're going.
Parking can be a little tricky, but
around South Street and Center City, if
you find the right lot, it will be around
$lO for the night.
If there are four or five of you, that's
much cheaper than taking the nextbest option, SEPTA.
Those ever-trusty SEPTA trains

provide direct service from the town of
Swarthmore to Center City. The R3
stops at the train station around once
an hour, and 36 minutes later you can
get off at the Market East terminal, just

a short walk from South Street or

Chinatown.
SEPTA will set you back $7.50 for a
round trip. But there's always the family pass trick. As long as one of the people you're with claims to be under 17,
you can get a one-way family pass for
$l5. There is no student discount for
the SEPTA trains. For timetables and

service announcements, check out

www.septa.org.
Once you're in the city, you can use
the subways and buses to get around.
But that's really only good if you're trying to get to an event down by the
Sports Complex. The buses are slow,
and the routes are confusing. Round
trips are $2, and a day-pass goes for
$5.50. You can also ride the newer
PHLASH buses. These run all day and
promise to take you to all of the big
attractions in the city. A day pass is $4.
After you've spent an exhausting
day in the city, you're going to have to
make your way back to Swat. Don't forget that the trains stop relatively early.
The last R3 leaves Market East at mid-

10:00 AM.

night during the week and at 11:19 p.m.
on the weekends. If you're in the city
for a concert or just for a night out, you

better catch that last train. Otherwise
you might have to wait until trains
start running again the next morning.
If all else fails, and you're stranded
in Philadelphia with no other way of
getting back to campus, you can always
take a cab. This works much better
with more people.
A typical cab ride will cost about $3O
to $35 with a tip. Just make sure you
know the way back to Swarthmore;
otherwise, there's no telling where
you'll end up.

Reading Terminal Market closes.
Get that last ice cream sundae.

Rock, Singer-Songwriters from Non-Singer-Songwriters ,
and within that, Male from Female. All that remained was
to parse down to Queer or Straight, Melancholy or Earnest.
A couple stores down, a cute shop called Squaresville
USA offers not only classic 60s reject clothing but time-period junk as well. While it boasts more character than floor
space or actual stuff of interest, it's a fun stop-in. Last Drop
is on the corner across the street, a great place to pull out a
notebook to go with your vegan latte and lofty expression.
The Paces of the neighborhood, it's where the locals go to
run into the people they hooked up with once and never
wish to see again.
If you'd rather fawn over animals than eat them, there's
a shelter around the corner. The folks-at the counter unceremoniously wave you back through a door to an area where
small, forlorn-looking cats watch you walk by. Farther back,
you can conduct conversations with Dalmatians.
If your taste runs more to people thanpets, Spruce Street
Video is a couple ofblocks away. They sell cheap movies on
the sidewalk as well as a see-it-to-believe-it poster of Jeff
Striker. More movies inside, with the most colorful selections on the second floor. (Funny: they also section off Male
from Female.) Further up still on the third floor, Hair
Extraordinaire has a side-room of drag clothing. Essentially
the selection is what you'd find at a vintage store, only the
shoes would fit Shaq. And if you want, you can get a new
haircut to match the dress.
One block over, on Walnut, is the premium thrift store of
the area, Buffalo Exchange. The rules, which I only glanced
at walking in but will repeat with confidence, are that you
can buy straight off the rack or you can bring in your own
clothing to sell or trade. The prices are decent and the range
impressive. I nearly bought an "I [heart] USA" shirt but I
just didn't think I could pull it off.
Nicely tucked away, the used book section of the Reading
Terminal Market on Filbert St. feels like a find. Flipping
boxfuls
through their selection of sex and religion books
of worn romance novels, Crumb comics, Hermann Hesse
is a great way to kill time between
and Nostradamus
SEPTA trains.

A charming little Venezuelan restaurant at 3rd and South, where, although

overpriced and underportioned, the food
is really spectacular. I shared the double

flounder with a cilantro garnish, and one
of wasabi'd salmon with tasty cucumber/citrus salsa as well as an entree of

served some nice bread with super-garlicked olive oil. It is the kind of food you
want to eat in large quantities.

All recommendations are from Brian Hertler, University of
Pennsylvania student and self-described "hip urbanite."
While in Philly, eventually, you're gonna have to get a

steak world: Pat's and Geno's. But which one should you choose
to get your Cheez-Wiz fix? Brian has a simple, time-tested
method: he prefers Pat's over Gino's because, frankly, it's "dirt-

8:46 p.m. Interview with the bagpiper.

FREEDOM IS RINGING AND SWINGING
BY KATE DUFFY

Rufus Harley's brand of patriotism extends far
beyond perfunctory flag-waving and U-S-A chanting. Harley, 66, named
his son America Beautiful. Before a gig, Harley typically dons a Viking
helmet, a kilt, and a star-spangled neckerchief.

For Harley, performing music is the most patriotic pursuit ofall. As the world's first and only jazz bagpiper, Harley
blends a culture usually reserved for haggis-hoarding

Highlanders with the heppest of American art forms.
"The bagpipe is a very special and sacred instrument,"
Harley said. "It has taught me a lot about life and harmony.
I guess you can call me the pied piper. I want to be the pied
piper of bringing peace and music and love and understanding to everyone here in America and around the world."
Though his contemporaries initially considered him a
maverick, Harley once played with some of the biggest
names in jazz: Sonny Rollins, Sonny Stitt, and John
Coltrane. An appearance on "The Arsenio Hall Show" in
1994 paved the way for Harley's piping feature on the Roots'
"Do You Want More?!!!??!" album.
Today, Harley continues to travel all over the planet, presenting Liberty Bell replicas to dignitaries and blasting his

gospel of unity through the international language ofmusic.
Harley kindly granted a phone interview from his
Philadelphia residence.

Phoenix: What was your musical career like before you
began playing bagpipes?
Rufus Harley: Well, to tell you the truth, I'm just a born
musician. When my mother was carrying me—she's a
descendent of the Cherokee nation—there was a shaman. He
looked at her stomach and said, "It's going to be a musician."
That was nailed on me, and from the time I was born up to 8
or 9,1 always used to rock back and forth and moan. I used
to bop my head, like I was keeping rhythm. I thought, "What
is wrong with me?"
I bought a C melody saxophone out of a pawnshop when
I was 12 years old. I shined shoes and sold newspapers on
the streets of Philadelphia, and I paid 65 dollars for it. As
soon as I got that saxophone, that bumping head just left.
When I was in school, I was always trying to play
rhythms on the desk, and the teachers just put me in music
class first thing in the morning. I was in the music classroom all day long. I'd be sweeping the floor and straightening chairs, getting ready for band rehearsal.
The music teacher told me when I was 17 or 18—he said
"You should keep up your music, you should continue." I
had to quit school at about the tenth grade because I had to
get a job, coming from that poor, broken family. The next
step was when I was 22 and I met this Italian-American
music teacher. His name was Dennis Sandoli. He took me
under his wing for 35 years. He taught me the saxophone,

flute, oboe and clarinet."

How did you first decide to play bagpipes?
I was sitting back one day in 1963, and I watched the burial services for President Kennedy.

"Why don't I go ahead and play some jazz on [bagpipes]?" I
looked in pawnshops, but I couldn't find any in Philly. I
went to New York and found a set. I've still got them here, sitting next to me. The pawnbroker says, "You sure you want
bagpipes?" I couldn't play them at first—l thought, this is
going to be rough. You've got to sustain, because it's really
a solar eclipse instrument.
... When I took it to school, the teacher told me, once you
learn the language, you can play it on any instrument. I continued to learn the language—the American international
English language, which is music.
The foundation of American culture is based upon music.

you say pentagon, that's German, when you say we, that's
French, when you say algebra that's Arabic, when you say
ghetto, that's Italian, and paddywagon is English. It makes
you a musician, once you understand the part you play on
the stage of life.
You're not going to understand what American is before
you understand me, and the word "write." And "we," which
is French and "us," which is our modern day intonation for
USA. The people came to America to get themselves in tune.
Once you spell America —A-M-E, there's me. R-I-C, dig it? E

equals mc squared.

Once you come from right to left, you got C-M-E, me. You

see what I'm saying? So now, what is me? Me is the innerme, not the enemy, which the system uses on a negative

level. Inner-me is inner self.
So we go to Revelation chapter three. Automatically, it's
me and we. You're turning that M and W around, and that
three—it's all in there together. Revelation 3, verses 6 and 7
Six says, "he who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
says." Then it goes to seven, which represents the 76ers.
Seven says, "And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia,
write."
Now, when you pick up your hand and hold your hand
up, that's five, five letters. Each one is a note. You have W,
you dig? Then R, which represents red, then you have the I,
which represents the center, middle finger. T, twenty which
is Gemini, balancing yin and yang. Then you have E. W and
the E, you got we, then it's the Constitution of the United
States, "We the people."
Every person came to America to become a write person—not white, not black, not pink. I'm saying that everybody, regardless of nationality, once they have learned to
write their name, they are a write person. That's kind of
deep and a little different, but it's very basic and it's got the
common sense to go with it.
A pool shooter knows how to put English on the pool ball
and clear the table. Thomas Jefferson said—he was a musician, he played violin—we are not going to have any peace
and harmony until we all learn to speak one common language.
You have to realize that when every nationality came on
the center of bandstand, which is America, they had to get
their chops together. If I say that we going to play "Stardust,"
although we got different instruments, we have all got to
understand the language to be in harmony.

What was your first jazz bagpipe gig like? What was the
crowd reaction?

When I first brought it in, I was performing with a group,
playing saxophone. I put blues together for bagpipes, but
when I brought them in, they fired me on the spot. No musicians would perform with me at that time. [Later] I found

three or four that worked.
You've played both traditional bagpipe tunes like
"Amazing Grace" and more unpredictable fare like the
Byrds' "Eight Miles High." After jazz, what's your
favorite style of music?
All music. This is what I love, sounding like Einstein: all
of it is relative. And it all has a part to play. Music is music.
Music is us. Music was just called music? It wasn't called
this type of music and that type of music. Then they sepa-

rated.
There's a verse in the bible that says "to the chief musician." Another verse in the Bible, Romans 16:13—"Salute
Rufus, chosen in the Lord, his mother and mine." Rufus
means red, but the way you spell it, there's U-S in Rufus. Us.
U-S. You can check those verses, and I play off of them,

because it's all about getting them write, which is the original note, other than me.

How many Liberty Bell replicas have you given away?
I've presented between 300 and 400 Liberty Bells around

the world. I gave one to the President of France, and I gave
one in Moscow. I gave one to Ed Rendell and one to Bill
Clinton. I gave one to Bush. I gave one to Bill Cosby, and I
think I did give one to Johnny Carson. I've done it to all over
the planet. I took it to Germany and presented it to the
German people on national TV while they were tearing
down the Berlin Wall. I march in parades. On April 6 we
marched to Ground Zero. It's deep, but the show has got to
go on.
You've rewritten the Constitution and called the revised
version "The Declaration of Freedom B3 the
Constithreetion of the United States of American and
the Commonwealth and the World." What does the B3
stand for?
I named it the Constitthreetion, because everything
comes in threes, you dig? Male and female come together,
another person comes from that. That's three.
I feel blessed to be in the city where the Constitution was
signed, because I really feel that the word republic and religion—to me religion is only the ancient word for reading.
Anyone who knows how to read has got religion. It just
depends up on what you want to read and what stimulates
you. Religion is a person who knows how to read.
Then we have the republic. To me the republic only
means—l'm putting some English on these words—it means
the public should learn to read. Twist it around; put a little
English on it.
The planes went down in New York—them dudes on
them planes had a language problem. They were out of tune,
and they wanted to take everyone else out with them. When
one person in an orchestra is out of tune, it's going to knock
everybody else out. I'm only talking about basic common
sense now.
The planes were U-S; that was all of us.
English puts us in tune with the entire solar system. It's
like looking at a clock. Other languages are just one number
or two numbers. We have taken from those other numbers in
the music that we're speaking.
What I did with pipes, I put them on right side. I put a little English on them. I play "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" and
"Jingle Bells" and "Moon River." That's never been done in
history. Those songs have never been played on bagpipes.
"Stormy Weather" ain't never been played on pipes, you see?
The musician is studying the science of sound; he has to

keep that harmony peace and love. What I'm really saying is,
be proud to be an American. The music we perform is the
highest art on the planet. I'm telling you.

I have a confession to make. I admit it; I'm from
Pittsburgh. And further, I'm from a really, really blue collar part of Pittsburgh. I'm talking 'haint nobody go to college round 'em parts, let alone some "all girls school" in
Philadelphia whose name sounds like an English mental
institution. Needless to say, art didn't play a huge part in
my community. But, in one of the proudest moments of
our city's history, Pittsburgh was ranked fourth in the
nation for its dedication to the arts. Wait a second, what
arts? I hear there's a similar dilemma on the other side of
the state. Philadelphia has a
plethora of art offerings, but
not a lot of Swarthmore students know about them. I
intend to change that singlehandedly today. Okay, I'll
try to make a dent at least.
This is a listing of theaters,
the houses of my favorite
aspect of the arts. Check
them out, save up the money
and the time, and go to the
shows. It's worth it.

In the 19th century Manayunk was
a prosperous mill town. Built into
steep hills along the Schuykill River,
the town thrived as a center of the
region's textile industry until a series
of droughts and a catastophic flood in
1870.
In the last twenty years an ambitious restoration effort has transformed Manayunk into a picturesque
alternative to Center City. A home to
many of Philadelphia's young professionals, the town boasts a trendy vibe
and a main drag with all the variety of
South Street with an extra touch of
class and considerably fewer tourists.

North Carolina roots, Mr. Adams still writes beautiful songs about maturation and breaking up. His

10.6-The Strokes @ Electric Factory: With this NYC
quintet, it's no longer an issue of deciding whether
it's cooler to like or hate the cool band because
they lost that title a long time ago. Nevertheless, no
one can parade around tighter songs or a drunken
ambience quite like them. Take it or leave it.
10.19-Sleater-Kinney, Yeah Yeah Yeahs @ The
Trocadero Theatre: Yeah, the riot-mom rock of
Sleater-Kinney is good, but get there early for the
art-trash dresses of Karen 0. and the art-trash rock
of her band, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.

10.22-Wilco @ Electric Factory: Rock 'n' roll's best
band makes its first trip to the area since the
release of its masterpiece, "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot."
In the past seven years, no one has matched the
skill of the band's lead singer/primary songwriter,
Jeff Tweedy, whose display of breadth, passion and

matched only by The Beatles.

SIMPLE STADIUM STUDY
Yes, Philadelphia is one of just a handful of
East Coast cities to have teams in all four
major sports. But the most beautiful thing
about the City of Brotherly Love is that all
four of these teams
the Eagles, Sixers,
Phillies and Flyers
play their games literally a stone's throw away from one another.
Hell, even the Philadelphia Phantoms, the
city's International Hockey League representative, play in the same complex. That's right,

the Philadelphia International Airport, and
take Exit 17 onto Rt. 291 North (Penrose
Avenue). Proceed over the George C. Piatt
Memorial Bridge, and make a right onto
Pattison at the traffic light. You can park on
the street, use stadium parking or, better yet,
park in Franklin D. Roosevelt Park.
If you don't have a car, don't fret. The stadium complex is one of the most accessible
places in Phildelphia. Take the R3 to
Suburban Station. Then, get lost in Suburban

decide to venture out to the corner of Broad
and Pattison for an afternoon or evening of
spectating, how in God's name do you get
there?
If you're blessed with a car, there are two
easy ways. The first, which I'd like to call the
Brute Force Method in honor of my astronomy professor, is straightforward. Take 1-95

North to Broad Street, Exit 17. (If they haven't
changed it to Exit 43,972 by now. The bastards
did that on 1-76, and they're doing it in my
hometown. I could barely find my way home
when I went back for the summer. Anyway, I
digress.) Bear left on the exit ramp and head
north on Broad Street. You'll see the stadiums
on your right. Follow the signs for stadium
parking, or make a U-turn and then a right to
get onto Pattison and park on the street.
The problem with the Brute Force Method
is traffic. Okay, so that's not much of a problem for Phillies or Phantoms games. But if
you're planning on seeing the Eagles, Sixers,
Flyers, or even the Republican National
Convention (which was held at the complex a
few years ago), then you might need to take a
shortcut. I'll call this Donny's Route, because

Once you're there, you might want to
avoid getting killed and/or maimed as you sit
back and enjoy the game. One simple way to
avoid injury is to avoid making a fool of yourself. Or better yet, avoid going to the game
with someone who is making a fool of himself. Case in point: I went to a Sixers game
with Matt Rubin (um, I hope I have his permission for this) freshman year. I needed to
finish doing some work before the game, so I
arrived a bit after he did. When I got there,
Matt was shirtless and had painted bright red
targets around each of his nipples. Not a problem at the time. But as the game progressed
and Matt danced more and more during
breaks in play, brandishing his nipples all the

while, things got ugly. Eventually, some
a few empties our
way. Of course they hit me, not Matt, and a
couple of the not-so-empty empties got me a
little wet. So, to cut a long story short: allow
no one in your party to make a complete ass
of himself at the game because chances are,
you'll get more beer than you ever wanted.
The easiest way to avoid getting killed is
to avoid rooting for the opposing team. While
this hasn't been much of a problem for me at
Sixers or Phillies games, where I've cheered
for the Knicks and Mets (God knows why)
with minimal hassle, I
hear the 70,000 drunkoff-their-ass fans at
Eagles games are less
forgiving. Back in 1989
during the "Snow
Bowl" against Dallas,
fans took advantage of
the recent snowstorm
to pummel opposing
players, coaches and
refs with snowballs.
But it was a 1997

Night
Football game with the '49ers, during which
over 60 fights broke out and '49ers fans were
hazed and harassed, that prompted the city to
set up a courtroom inside Veterans Stadium,
with the honorable Seamus McCaffrey presiding. Eagles Court, as it is called, has certainly been a nice complement to the two
holding cells which have been used in the stadiumfor years. But don't think the court has
made it safe for visiting teams' fans. On
McCaffrey's first day on the job, he saw 15
fans in his court by halftime, so the court has
not been an entirely effective deterrent. The
best way to avoid getting killed at a game still
hasn't changed: wear a Donovan McNabb jersey and an Eagles cap.

PACES

As baseball coach Frank Ago vino aptly put it, "Who
shoots for mediocrity in this whole place?" Certainly
not Agovino, and not the other 20 coaches of

Swarthmore's varsity teams.
This week, The Phoenix took a look at how coaches
approach the difficult task of fielding competitive
teams for a college that clearly considers athletics tangential to its mission. We hope to have shed light on
how there is a growing optimism that many teams
won't continue to survive on mediocrity. We also hope
that the new slotting system developed as a part of the
controversial Athletic Review Committee's proposal
two years ago will be a good thing for Swarthmore's
teams.
Not because athletic successes are central to some
sense of college pride. Not because the college owes
such successes to athletes who felt undervalued after
the football cut. Simply because the coaches and athletes pouring their efforts into something they love
deserve a chance to succeed at the highest level possible.
Attempting to spark a discussion about slotting
a
contested term to begin with may seem to some to be

stirring up unnecessary controversy. Students here
don't fit neatly into categories. So why focus on the category of "athletes," "recruits," or "slotted students"?
It hearkens back to a time two years ago, when an
entire group of dedicated students here felt stereotyped, pigeonholed and ultimately rejected by

a college

unwilling to maintain a football team.
The college's athletic programs faced a difficult situation in the late 19905. Many coaches struggled with a
lack of player dedication, as baseball coach Frank
Agovino points out in this weeks' article. An
inequitable slotting system hampered teams' recruitment efforts; only 12 teams received admissions preference for their recruited players, and admissions
slots were not distributed equitably among the teams.
After the college cut the football team in December
2000, college officials promised that they would create
a more equitable and effective slotting system that
would better meet the needs of the athletics programs
and the college as a whole. At the time, many students

the football decision as a demonstration of
the college's lack of commitment to its athletic programs.
While the percentage of each incoming class allocated to athletic slots was lowered from 18 percent to 15
percent, it appears that the changes made to the slotting system have had generally positive results.
The absence of the football team means that more
slots now go to a greater number of teams.
Maybe improvement in some teams' records is still
years off, but coaches are already noting increased
enthusiasm and commitment among players.

Israel's solution not viable
Dear Editor:
[Re: Arafat's invisible constituents, Phoenix, Sept. 26]
Aviva Aron-Dine's article regarding the Summer 2000
Camp David negotiations reinforces one of the most widespread Israeli myths propagated by the U.S. media. Claims
of Barak's "generous" offer to Palestinians, including "95
percent of the West Bank" are absolutely untrue. In an OpEd article entitled, "Building a Wall Against Terror," in the
May 24, 2001 edition ofThe New York Times, Barak himself
states that he actually envisioned "a gradual process of
establishing secure, defensible borders, demarcated so as to
encompass more than 80 percent of the Jewish settlers in
several settlement blocs over about 15 percent of Judea and
Samaria, and to ensure a wide security zone in the Jordan

Valley."

How could Barak offer 95 percent of the West Bank to
Palestinians, when clearly he intended to retain 15 percent
of "Judea and Samaria" (the West Bank) as Israeli territory? Barak's very choice of words
"Judea and Samaria"
imply that he is deepening notions of Jewish biblical
'birthright' to the entire region.
There was no "viable Palestinian state" up for negotiation. Barak and his government believed they could continue their illegal military occupation of Palestinian territories under the guise of a "state." They also believed that the
Palestinians would readily surrender to this humiliating
deception. Barak came to the negotiation table with a takeit-or-leave-it attitude leaving no room for compromise.
Arafat came to the negotiation table with a clear objective:
that Israel wouldabide by international law and end its illegal occupation. As a result, it was, in fact, the Israeli officials who walked away from the Camp David accords.
Shortly thereafter, the talks at Taba (January 2001) broke
off, due to Barak's cancellation of a planned meeting with
Arafat and his subsequent loss to Ariel Sharon in the
February 2001 elections. Ariel Sharon, whom President
Bush calls a "man of peace," is the architect of the 1982 mas-

Arafat and the Palestinian people made far more concessions at the Camp David accords than the Israeli or
American media has ever given them credit for. For example, they accepted the notion of Israeli annexation of West
Bank territory to accommodate settlement blocs, the principle of Israeli sovereignty over the Jewish neighborhoods
of East Jerusalem, and countless others. Yet when Barak
introduced the concept of "temporary Israeli control" over
the Palestinian "state," it became clear what his intentions
truly were: to continue to allow the presence of illegal
Israeli settlements in the West Bank, as well as Israeli military control over borders and water resources, the establishment of Jewish-only roads, and other apartheid-like
policies. Also, as a condition of the accords Israel would be
able to deploy its forces at any time into the Palestinian
"state." As for the millions of Palestinian refugees, they
would never have a right to return. Instead, they were to be
compensated for the loss of their lands, homes, integrity
and identity, not by the state of Israel, which took this all
away, but instead by the "international community."
In short, Palestinians would never choose violence over
negotiations. In fact, Palestinians would be more than

happy to negotiate for a viable solution. What they choose
is to resist the illegal military occupation that is forced
upon them and not to settle for negotiations that aim to
legitimize this occupation.

avatars of global capitalism, I
feel a little pang of guilt. If I
protest the policies of the IMF
and World Bank I risk being associated with IMF/World
Bank protestors, and that's a situation I just don't want to

be in.

Part of the problem is philosophical in nature. The pro
testors operate under the basic assumptions that capitalism
is inherently wicked, that materialism is degrading, anc

that the poor are best served by the socialist-lite economi
policies which have been so wildly successful in places lik
India or Egypt. I think that global capitalism is a good ide
and just want to see that it's implemented properly.
Although we'd both like to see reform, we have very di

ferent reasons for wanting it. But this sort of conflict isn'
necessarily a big problem. For example, Christian funda

mentalists and Jewish Zionists have very different reason
for supporting the continued existence of Israel, and the
can still agree to work together.
Another, somewhat more pressing concern, is that th
IMF/World Bank protest movement has become an umbre
la for about a thousand sub-causes, many of which are tota

unrelated to each other and some of which are downrigh
wacko. It's not clear what poverty in the Third World has t
do with war in Iraq or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, othe
than that all three are allegedly the fault of some vaguel
defined capitalist bogeyman.
Some of the other issues on display are even less rele
vant to globalization. I am convinced that if you took a sur
vey of every half-baked cause represented at these gather
ings, there would be a small Lyndon Larouche contigen
denouncing NASA's use of satellite-mounted mind contro
rays, and at least one protestor holding up a placard tha
says "No Fat Chicks."
This diversity of discontent probably keeps some peopl
away, as nobody wants to express solidarity with a caus
they don't believe in. It's also just inefficient. As everyon
with common sense knows, trying to do everything at one
means that nothing at all gets done.
There's also the matter of the riots that invariably
accompany these little affairs. It is fun to destroy things and
start fires and generally run around like a maniac. Anyon
who denies that is a liar. But what exactly do these "Rucku
Society" clowns think they're accomplishing when they
smash a coffee shop's window? Starbucks' net profits fall by
one billionth of a percentile point, the glassmaking industry
gets some extra business and some poor slob making th
minimum wage has to spend his afternoon sweeping up bro
ken glass. That's some nice work there, anarchists.
Everyone would be better off if they dropped their annoying
pretense about sticking it to the Man and just formed a
ly

backyard-wrestling league.
So as much as I might like to denounce the IMF and
World Bank, I just can't bring myself to do it. Nor am I the
only one with this problem. The unions, who typically send
a delegation to globalization protests, were careful to keep

their distance this time around. Blue-collar Americans
but they sure as heck
don't want to associate with patchouli-scented no-goodniks
who think that misspelling "America" as "AmeriKKKa" is
the height of political wit.
Reforming the IMF and World Bank is a cause that couh
potentially win a lot of public support. Nobody has eve
been particularly enamored with moneylenders, and, eve
since Andrew Jackson, distrust of bureaucratic elites ha
been a part of American culture. But given the choic
between inept economists or flag-burning Chomskyites
most people will reasonably choose the former.

watching black soot billow into the air
from factory smokestacks, then getting home and
watching every last green morsel swallowed by developers. The problems are clear. The solution, not just for
New Jersey, but for all the United States, lies in a reliable, effective and affordable public transportation system. Fewer cars and SUVs means less pollution, less
terrible road planning that causes congestion, and less
odoriferous travel. As for landfills, we have to buckle
down and improve waste "disposal," as well as recycle,
compost and do something about those New Yorkers.
The underlying problem is relevant to these times of
tension surrounding Iraq. Yes, petroleum. I have no
doubt that New Jersey consumes more energy than
many nations twice its size. Nor do I doubt that this is
due in no small part to oil and automobile lobbying
groups. Our lifestyles are shaped and our soldiers risk
their lives for the auto-dependent way of life. Wasn't
that what George W. was talking about when he said
that we would not compromise the American way of
life? Isn't that what American flag stickers stuck all
over Ford Excursions mean?
At the turn of the century, General Motors bought
all the trolley systems in the big cities, so that everyone who could afford it would buy automobiles. This
created an economic polarization that put the rich in
cars and the poor on buses. Along with the "suburbs
are heaven" campaign and Eisenhower's highway
building spree in the 19505, which he never planned on
even reaching cities, came congestion, auto dependency, white flight and the decline of mass transit.
Some bad things (sprawl and landfills) manifest
themselves in New Jersey because Wall Street brokers
need nice lawns, and because the fifties made it possible to commute. Otherwise, it's just-a place where
you've been able to see the influence of Big Oil and

the epicenter of capitalism needs
more of everything and needs more roads to get it
there.

Economics behind living wage not so simple
Dear Editor:
In explaining his opposition to a living wage, Randy
Goldstein cites analyses he says "any student of introductory economics" will understand. I'm a student of
introductory economics myself, and I understand his
points, but I remain a committed member of the
Swarthmore living Wage & Democracy Campaign.
Here's why.
It's true, as Goldstein points out, that a market-based
wage is determined by what other employers pay for a
similar job, but the concept is a little circular. After all,
for any other employer, Swarthmore's wages become
part of a market comparison. Market pay is just the average of how highly employers
value the work, and some
kinds of work, especially work
traditionally done by women
and people of color, are undervalued to this day. Arguing for
a living wage doesn't mean we
should artificially inflate
wages above the value of the
labor. It means we're not valuing the work fairly now. We
need to reexamine our priorities and acknowledge that a
full day's work is worth a full day's wages.
After all, the work of the lowest-paid staff at the college
in Environmental Services, Dining Services and
Grounds
is vital to our health and safety. The college
couldn't operate without this work. Even within the rules
of the market system, we're always free to start paying
for it as much as we truly value it. In fact, there are plenty of schools in our area that do pay more for the same
kind of work that's done here, but we don't include them

in our market comparisons. Those are schools where the
workers have unions.
Historically, workers and their allies have always had
to fight for rights and respect in the workplace. All of us
who have jobs or will soon can thank the labor movement
for the eight-hour day and the weekend. But in recent
decades the decline in real wages has forced many hardworking people to take second jobs just to pay the bills.
As a school traditionally committed to social justice and
lucky enough to have a large endowment, we can decide
today to pay enough for all the full-time employees here
to make a decent living.
We won't even be the first to do so. The living wage
movement is building support
mmmm^^^^^^^mmim
around the nation, not only at
colleges but also through
municipal ordinances and
to statewide campaigns. It's no
longer possible to argue that it
quo. just can't be done. Instead of
insurmountable
obstacles,
there remain only questions
about how best to structure and implement a living wage.
It will be time to start answering those questions as soon
as we have affirmed our commitment to the goal.
We cannot, must not use economics simply as a tool to
enforce an unjust status quo. After all, an economic system is just something people invent as a means to some
ends, so when the ends aren't what we want, we have a
right
even a responsibility
to start adjusting the
rules. Ask what economics can do for the people, not
what the people can do for economics.

New laws rewarding public school administrators misdirected
Across the United States,

public schools are going to

shit. We all know that. We all

sat either in public schools
where we listened to the stats
comparing

our standardized

test scores (dismally) with
those of our international
counterparts (Japan, for example, where they don't get summer break) or in private
schools where we were told to
be thankful we weren't, God

forbid, attending a lousy public school. The simple solution
would seem to be to increase
Ruminations
the focus on public education,
which would directly and linearly increase its quality. The
problems, however, are manifold, and a direct route, at this
point, is completely inaccessible.
New York is the latest to join the list of states that have
enacted laws providing public school superintendents with
monetary bonuses on the basis of their students' performance on standardized achievement tests. This is so obscene
as to be absurd. We all know from having taking the muchlauded SAT Is and lis (and possibly even the accessory
Kaplan classes) that the key to taking those tests is to learn
the test itself, not the material it claims to be testing. The
test-makers themselves acknowledge this and use it as a

MORGHAN HOLT

marketing strategy to sell their coveted test-prep materials.
Standardized test scores are not indicators of schools' educational quality, but simply insight into how wellschools are
training their pupils to take those stupid tests. Education
isn't about multiple choice. This sort of legislation has the
right sentiment... it's just horribly misdirected.
I am lucky enough to live in an area that boasts some of
Pennsylvania's best school districts. I have no doubts that
my daughter will receive a top-notch education in the years

that she attends the Swarthmore district schools. Part of the
reason is the community commitment to making its schools
high-quality and part of it is simply the tax bracket. I expected her school year to begin with a long list of supplies from
Crayola to Kleenex and was appalled not to receive one.
Everything is provided at school. And then some. And while
I appreciate the fact that the kindergarteners are being treated well (and, moreover, their parents are spared the hassle
of an extra trip to Target), it's ridiculous to me that there are
schools that can't afford textbooks or adequate classroom
space while this district is buying the Kleenex for the kids.
I'd rather spring for tissue and markers and have the money
saved and sent to Chester to buy books or desks. The
inequality of public school districts is staggering. I'm
thrilled that my daughter's in a great school, but dismayed
that it's at the expense of a kid who has to sit in the hall and
try to learn.
Schools in D.C. have stopped offering special ed for kids
with severe learning and developmental disabilities because
they can't afford to pay someone to teach a special-needs
class. These kids are expected to perform on par with their

Low-wage workers
deserve respect
Dear Editor:
I would like to point out a few problems I have with Randy
Goldstein's argument against the living wage. I must admit that I
have never taken an economics class, because I believe that the concept of the free market is inherently flawed, since it doesn't recognize
the influence of power dynamics on the market. Adam Smith assumed
that under capitalism, workers would have the power to demand fair
wages. In modern capitalism, workers are prevented from using that
power through a variety of legal and illegal means.
I would also like to state that by Goldstein's logic, Swarthmore's
low-wage staff ought to be paid significantly more than they are now;
most of them are doing more work than they were hired to do. The college is deliberately understaffed to save money. If Goldstein would
like the bathrooms in Willets to be 33 percent cleaner, he should
demand that the college hire as many people as it ought to (I wonder
how much they'd have to pay us to get us to keep the bathrooms
cleaner). I agree with Goldstein that understaffing is detrimental to
low-wage workers; the Living Wage Campaign has always maintained
that wages must be increased without cutting any jobs. But I also
want to point out that in communities with a living wage ordinance,
businesses do not tend to fire workers or lose vast amounts of money.
When we think about compensation, we also need to think about
the value that low-wage workers at Swarthmore have in the community. Many people work here in the same position for decades.
These folks add to our community, teaching students through programs like Learning For Life and doing a good job at what they do.
Many staff members here are proud of being part of the Swarthmore
community and like getting to know students, faculty and administrators, as we like getting to know them and should be proud to
know them. Our wages, and the way we treat low-wage staff, should
reflect the fact that our dorms are not cleaned by machines. I for one

am glad they're not.

The campaign's research has turned up a few viable ways to pay
for a living wage, including fundraising and spending a slightly higher percentage of the endowment. Neither of these involve cutting into
financial aid or raising tuition. I am willing, however, to start thinking about what we could to give up to make this the kind of community we'd be proud to live in. Several faculty members have discussed
temporarily giving up their annual raises to support a living wage.
This measure shows serious commitment to and respect for those
who take care of the day-to-day running of the college.
As an institution with a stated commitment to fostering ethical
intelligence, Swarthmore should stop forcing low-wage workers to
subsidize other people's children's education, at the expense of their
own children's education.

Investigate a living wage fairly
Dear Editor:
The international political tension in the air is so
thick these days that we might as well be breathing

in water. Talk of war in

Iraq,

the situation in

Palestine and the memory of September 11 has left
many of us overlooking some of the most crucial

injustices right beneath our own noses.
Has it ever happened to you that on an average
day in Sharpies you placed your tray on that conveyor belt and actually watched it disappear until it met

the anonymous hands of the workers around the corner? Do you ever wonder if they have a family at

home, if they are able to afford basic health care or if
they are meeting the financial demands of living in
our society? Maybe you felt like there was nothing
that you could do. Well, we at the Swarthmore Living
Wage and Democracy Campaign believe otherwise
and wish to use this opportunity to alert you to the
processes of the formation of a new committee
designed to study the issue of the living wage.
We are at a crucial moment in our campaign, and
we want you to to be aware of the issues. Since the
SLW&DC has come into existence the college has
raised the minimum wage for staff at Swarthmore

from $6.66 per hour to $9 per hour. The Ad Hoc
Committee on a Living Wage is currently in the
process of selecting staff and student members. We
believe that part of the intent of this committee
should be to provide low-wage staff an opportunity to
voice their own concerns and play a role in this
process. Unfortunately, the Campaign's request that
low-wage staff be allowed to choose representatives
through a direct election process has been greeted
with indifference by the administration and Staff
Advisory Council. They have allowed for a flawed
nomination process with fast-approaching deadlines
and limited information provided to the staff.
We are writing to you in a show of faith that we as
members of a community can expect a committee
process that reflects the ideals of ensuring democracy and a voice for all members of the community. We
anticipate that a fair Ad Hoc committee can be created democratically, and operate democratically, in a
manner that empowers low-wage staff by providing

them an active role in a committee created to
improve their compensation at the college.

Life beyond the Swat bubble
Dear Editor:
I am not a member of the Swarthmore College
Living Wage Campaign. I am not an experienced
Swarthmore activist who feels his work has been
insulted. I am merely a freshman who was warned
about the pretentious classical-model-economicswielding students I would encounter at an elite and
affluent school like Swarthmore but is still not used

to it.
Randy Goldstein's arguments against the concept
of a living wage are an insult to anyone who has ever
been stuck at the bottom and has had to work to survive. The fact that employers fix salaries "through an
intricate price system" does not justify a wage too
low to pay for health care. The fact that employees
[could] be replaced by a machine does not make it all
right to pay too little for the family's groceries. I
won't even bother to counter Randy's contention that
a living wage being paid for entry-level positions will
cause high school students to drop out in droves to
become janitors and forget any ambitions for a

"average" peers. They're essentially being set up for failure,

because the budget is kind of tight.
Ask anyone who's majoring in education how often
they've gotten shocked responses after announcing their
intentions to teach after they graduate. Unless they're specifically targeting a private school, chances are they've been
derided, asked why they bothered to attend Swat at all when
they could have gone to community college to be a teacher,
told that they needed to do something respectable or simply
scoffed at and told they needed to get serious, that they were
way too smart to "just teach." If, as a society, we're scolding
our best and brightest for wanting to teach kids and sending
the barely educated in their stead, how can we possibly
expect our kids to perform well on standardized tests or otherwise? Polls are published all the time that demonstrate
Americans' overwhelming lack of knowledge. This isn't
because we're intrinsically stupid, but because we weren't
taught, because our teachers didn't know themselves.
Legislation that reinforces the focus on test scores and
rewards the superintendent (not the teacher, or the students,
for that matter) for students' performance is neither an
appropriate nor a realistic solution. It will only make things
worse. As more states jump on the bandwagon, hoping to
improve their educational systems and stop their taxpayers'
bitching, I predict a steady decline in the quality of
American education. All of us are currently working our
way through the pillar of academic prestige, but we had to

diploma or further education.
Randy may have had a good point about the effect
the establishment of a living wage would have on
Swarthmore if its budget is truly tight. But we are not
just talking about the Swarthmore bubble here. How
much has the average executive salary grown while
the minimum wage has stagnated and lost buying
power? Living wage campaigns are badly needed
because the benefits of economic growth have been
hoarded by those on top while real working men and
women have had to deal with increasing costs on
more or less the same wages.
I guess I'll have to find a way to understand those
of my fellow students who will be the future Ken Lays
and Milliken brothers. But I suggest to them that

they try living under the constant stress of having to
worry about where the money for food, rent and
health care will come from sometime before they,
with Swarthmore degrees in hand, start making decisions that affect the lives of others.

Coverage misleading
Dear Editor:
The Phoenix dropped the ball on its coverage of the faculty panel on Iraq. Instead of calling it as it is, a panel that is
unanimously against sending troops for a war against Iraq,
the Phoenix instead ran a cover screaming "Debate Comes to
Campus." The headline, "Faculty panel offers mixed views on
Iraq invasion," of the article inside continued to mislead
readers that there was a healthy debate in the Scheuer room
that night.
As the Daily Gazette's story, one without the heavy editorializing evident in the Phoenix story, says and my own presence in the Scheuer room confirms, there was no real debate
present in the room. The closest thing resembling a debate on
whether we should invade Iraq is the different reasons

offered why we shouldn't invade Iraq.
This case of editorializing news coverage of a serious
event is a great disservice to the college community.
Swarthmore College deserves better, more unbiased coverage
from its student-funded newspaper.

Diversify committee: apply
Dear Editor:
On behalf of Appointments Committee, I am writing regarding our upcoming appointments for the Living Wage
Committee. As many of you may remember, the committee ran
into several difficulties last semester. One such reason (of

many!) had to do with the relative ideological homogeneity of
all appointed student members regarding the issue. To ensure
that these difficulties do not arise again, we are actively soliciting applications from all ideological camps on this issue. We
want the community to "own the results" of this committee's
work and look forward to a diverse pool of applications.

Addressing morality
Dear Editor:
In the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1830, Lincoln argued
that "the real issue in this controversy the one pressing on
is the sentiment on the part of one class that
every mind
looks upon the institution of slavery as a wrong and of another class that does not look upon it as a wrong
it is the sentiment around which all their actions
all their argument
circle."
I guess we can debate economics, endowments, entitlements, markets, but when I hear low-wage workers say they
can't afford co-pays for medicines or doctor visits, have no
money for basic dental treatments, are unable to save for
their children's education, can't be home with their kids
because they have to work two jobs, and are unable to go to
the hospital to visit a relative cause they can't afford bus fare,
I know a living wage will at least begin to address "a moral,
social and political wrong" of our times.

Alums' generosity warrants gratitude, not complaint
Dear Editor,
In a recent edition of the Phoenix [September 26, 2002]
the current capital campaign and the recent launch event
in Philadelphia were described as if raising money were
dirty business. What such a description reflects is an
incomplete understanding of the degree to which all of us
who have been or are being educated here are dependent
upon the generosity of others who were asked to give their
money. The college is not likely to get these gifts if we, do
not make the case for needing them and then ask for them.
The work is, in fact, quite rewarding when you believe in
the institution and are able to bring to others who also
believe in it the opportunity to sustain its future.

;

Sometimes one even finds alumni who feel independently
obliged to give and hardly need asking. One such was the
author James Michener who wrote the following on the
occasion of his 40th reunion in 1969:

THE PHOENIX

"...

I would be false to every aspect of my life and expe-

rience if I refused to testify that my college degree was the
passport into a wild and vivid life of the mind and into a

tion was an act of faith which I have never forgotten I
therefore must conclude finally that everyone profits
when a college is kept functioning and everyone would
lose considerably if it were prevented from further func...

tioning."

The College is not likely to get these
gifts if we do not make the case for
needing them and then ask for them.

Michener himself gave a gift of $2 million to the college
to "repay" his scholarship and was generously supportive
on other occasions as well, including through his will. I
cite him as but one example of a person who understood
that private liberal arts education of the sort we have been
privileged to receive is dependent upon the philanthropic
acts of others we may never meet who have responded to

full participation of the problems of my civilization. In my
particular case, coming as I did from a family with no
income at all and no prospects whatever, college was that
narrow door which led from darkness into light. The fact
that Swarthmore gave me the money to pay for my educa-

past fund raising efforts.
As Michener knew, the future of this and like institutions depends upon the current generation's understanding and acceptance of the same duty.

Anjani Reddy 'O4 might be running out of room in her trophy case.
After winning the Centennial Conference singles title last
spring, the junior has gone 11-1 in singles play this fall, winning the Mary Washington Invitational and the Swarthmore
Invitational titles. This past weekend, Reddy lost a close 7-5,
6-1 match to No. 1 seed Elena Blanina, the two-time NCAA
Division 111 Women's Singles National Champion, in the
semi-final round of the ITA Southeast Regional.
The highlight of the fall season, the regional tournament
is a feeder tournament to the ITA National Small College
Championships, this year sponsored by Omni Hotels. The
eight regional champions play in Corpus Christi, Texas, for
the fall national title. Reddy won the regional tournament
her freshman year, and last year advanced to the semi-final

round.
After putting a lot of pressure on herself to defend her
title last year, Reddy approached this year's tourney with a
different approach.
"I just wanted to get some good wins in," Reddy said. "I
wanted to hold my own."
The road to the semi-final round started on Saturday for
the fourth-seeded Reddy with a 6-0, 6-2 romp over
Haverford's Anjani Naidu. Reddy's 6-3, 6-0 victory over
Salisbury's Sam Coldean then put her in the round of 16. On

Caroline Celano 'O4 for most of the short fall season, head
Jeremy Loomis is still trying new doubles combinations.

Sunday, Reddy defeated two players from Washington and
Lee to advance to the semifinals. Marie Trimble was first to
go as Reddy dominated 6-2, 6-2. A 6-0, 6-2 victory over
Elizabeth Law sealed the trip to Monday's competition.
Reddy was well prepared going into the match against
top seed Blanina.
"I played her last spring," Reddy said. "She's good but her
game has beatable points."
After staying with Blanina for much of the first set,
Reddy lost her groove for a moment, and Blanina never
looked back.
"You can't loose your concentration with her." Reddy
said. "I started hanging short, and she took the momentum
and placed all her shots."
While the loss is Reddy's first of the season, she has a positive outlook for the rest of her junior season.
"It was my toughest match," Reddy said of the matchup
with Blanina. It showed me where I am with my playing,
and what I need to work on."
One thing that might be on Reddy's mind for the spring
season is a trip to nationals. After going her freshman year,
she was passed over last spring despite her stellar singles
record.
"Anjani really proved herself this fall season," Katherine
Voll 'O3 said. "Her performance in the semifinals basically
proved that she deserves to go to nationals."
Reddy also played doubles with rookie Emily Townsend
'O6 at the ITA regional. While Reddy had been playing with

coach

While still feeling each other out, Reddy and Townsend
lost 8-6 to the No. 4 seeded team in the first round, before
going on to win the consolation draw. "By the end of the first
match, we'd figured out how to play every game." Reddy
said. "It's great to play with Emily."
Both Reddy and Voll have cited the hard work of new
coach Loomis in the team's success this fall and the team's
potential in the spring season.
"I think Jeremy knows how to deal with our team."
Reddy said. "With way he approaches the team, we definitely have the potential to be one of the top Division 111 teams
in upcoming years."
Part of Loomis' impact this weekend was his attention to
the individuals. "You could tell he was better than the other
coaches there." Voll said. "He really pays attention to individual matches and knows just when to come over and
coach."
Though the ITA regional usually marks the end of the fall
season, the team will cap off its success by playing Kutztown
on Saturday. Look for Reddy to lead the team in the No. 1
singles spot, and possibly to add some Centennial
Conference hardware to her collection in the spring.
"I love our team." Reddy said. "We're going to be really
strong in the spring, and are looking to win the conference
and go to nationals."

Garnet Tide defeat Gettysburg for first
time since 1989, extend record to 6-5
BY DEBBIE FARRELLY

dfarrell@swarthmore.edu

Early on in the 2002 season, women's

soccer head coach Amy Brunner said, "It's
the big games that are really going to help
us measure where we are as a team." The
season has included two "big games" thus
far: a loss to Richard Stockton two weeks
ago and a matchup with nationally ranked
Gettysburg this past Saturday. Prior to the
game Brunner said, "Hopefully we'll play
up to them. We tend to play to the level of
our competition, so you never know what
could happen."
She got that right. For the first time
since 1989, the Garnet Tide were victorious
against
the Bullets of Gettysburg.
Gettysburg had established itself as an
elite team
ranked third in the region and
17th in the nation last week
so the Tide's
victory certainly qualified as a big win in
Brunner's book. "We were ready to show
Gettysburg that we are no push-over,"
Brunner said. "They were surprised at the

start, not really expecting a game."
Swarthmore showed an incredible
amount of intensity right from the start,
particularly defensively. Led by Jordan
Shakeshaft 'O5, the defense refused to allow
even one ball to cross into the box. "Jordan
has been our saving grace throughout the
season. She consistently wins the balls in

the air, goes into hard tackles, and makes
smart plays out of our backfield," Katey
McCaffrey 'O4 said. Goalkeeper Catherine
Salussolia 'O4 also turned in another solid
performance, with eight saves in goal.
Meanwhile, the Garnet offense worked
tirelessly to get the ball up the field. The
efforts paid off when, only 12 minutes into
the game, Shavaugn Lewis 'O5 found Tanya
Hahnel 'O5 at the top of the box to give the
Garnet Tide an early 1-0 lead. Soon after, a
shot attempt from Corey Pilver 'O4 narrowly missed the goal. Swarthmore's solid play

continued into the second half, visibly frus-

trating the Bullets. "The last 13 minutes
seemed to take forever, but we hung
tough," Brunner said. With 20 seconds to
go, Gettysburg unleashed a shot at goal
that could have tied the game at one, but
Salussolia was there to stop it and ensure
the 1-0 victory.
According to Brunner, the team could
not be more pleased with the win. "It was
our first win against a regionally ranked
opponent in recent memory and the
biggest win over at least our last four
years," she said.
"I think it has a lot to say about the
team and their intensity and desire. If we
can continue to play as aggressively and as
intensely as we did against Gettysburg, I
feel that we can make a strong run for the

The win versus Gettysburg came after a
disappointing double-overtime loss to
Franklin and Marshall on Wednesday.
Swarthmore controlled the flow of the ball
at the start of the game, but the Diplomats
gradually gained momentum. The game
remained scoreless until Franklin and
Marshall's Amanda Zambrano put the
Diplomats ahead 1-0 with a goal 24 minutes
into the second half. Swarthmore tied the
game at one when Lewis scored only seven
minutes later. The squads remained knotted at 1-1 until 21 seconds into the second
overtime period, when Zambrano found
the back of the net for the winning goal.
"It was one of those games when you
know you played your hardest and you still

didn't win. It's really disappointing, but
I'm still happy with the way we played,"
Sarah Hobbs 'O6 said.
More than halfway through the season,
the Garnet Tide have a record of 6-5 overall and 2-2 in the conference as they continue their quest to finish "Over the Top"
with a winning record. If the victory
against Gettysburg is any indication, the
team certainly has the capability to
accomplish that goal. "The win against
Gettysburg was so huge," Shakeshaft said.
"It just reinstated the fact that we are the
hottest team on campus."
The team travels to Washington College
on Saturday and returns home to battle
Ursinus next Wednesday at 4 p.m.

Hahnel named conference Player of the Week
Midfielder Tanya Hahnel earned
conference Player of the Week honors
for women's soccer for scoring the
only goal in Swarthmore's 1-0 win over
Gettysburg last Saturday.
In the 33rd minute of the second
half, Hahnel slipped a pass from teammate Shavaugn Lewis through the
hands of Gettysburg goalkeeper Carine

Doyle to give the Garnet the 1-0 lead.
The Tide held on for their first victory
over Gettysburg since 1989.
Hahnel, a sophomore from Silver
Spring, Md., has been highly productive
for Swarthmore this year. Getting the
start in ten of the Tide's eleven games
thus far, Hahnel has scored two goals

and tabbed one assist this season.

Albright outpaces Evil Buzzards 22-10
Less than six months after Swarthmore and Albright got involved in an all-out
brawl which resulted in suspensions for several Albright players and one recent
Swarthmore graduate, the two teams avoided any serious confrontations in a
well-played 22-10 match on Saturday.
Erik Munroe, being tackled above, and Randy Goldstein each scored tries for
the Evil Buzzards, but the squad could not muster enough offense to capture its
second win of the season.
The Buzzards will look for that second win this Saturday, when they travel to
Lafayette for a 1 p.m. game. Swarthmore returns home to face Ursinus on Oct. 26.

Football is a
full-time job
That's it. Stick a fork in me, because I am done.

My Swattie tendencies have finally gotten the best of me, and
I have completely exhausted myself. I have stretched myself
thin; extended my limit; bit off more than I could chew; realized
that my eyes were entirely bigger than my stomach. One man
simply cannot serve as general manager and coach for two NFL
franchises, coach a major college football team and play
makeshift bookie. It cannot be
done. Please come with me as I
walk you through one of my typ-

The average man works five

days a week. Not me. The week-

ends are no time for vacation
when one is in my position. No
overtime, no "thanks for putting
in the extra hours," no nothing.
The weekends are crunch time.
Saturday is spent breaking

down the college football games

of the day. I nitpick relentlessly,
looking at factors such as home

field, playing field, weeks of
preparation and
game-time
playing decisions. After a morning full of gathering information, it is time to break down the
point spreads. I labor at deciding which team will cover, waiting until that final second to double click on my decision. Sure,
my online college pick 'em league may only be for pride
between friends, but when pride is all you got, you better do
your homework.
Sunday, of course, makes Saturday look like Club Med. After
a week of pouring over the latest minutiae in the NFL, I make
my final checks while watching NFL Countdown on my beloved
ESPN. Once I have analyzed the day's matchups, injury reports
and tendencies, I have the unenviable job of choosing a starting
lineup for the White Shadows and future potential: the two fantasy franchises I recently purchased for an undisclosed amount.
Each week provides me with new decisions, each of which could
decide the fate of my squads.
It is after the lineups are set, though, that the pain and suffering truly begin. Once the games come on my television set, I
become fully deluded, believing wholeheartedly that each of
these players no longer plays solely for his team, but also for
me. I chastise coaches for not giving my players the ball, scream
at defenses for not shutting down my opponents, and die a thousand deaths when one of my own goes down with an injury. I
become a math whiz, dividing, multiplying, adding and subtracting in the hope of keeping a running tally on my team's
points. I have even rooted for players to do well against my
Eagles, telling myself that it is all right to cheer for one opposing player as long as I wish no ill will towards my own team.
After the damage has been done on Sunday, a full week of
management and coaching awaits. I analyze player performances and immediately begin wheeling and dealing. I pick up free
agents and attempt to make trades. I theorize about lineups in
class, trying to squeak out an extra point wherever I can.

Tide fall to McDaniel
in double overtime
BY JIM DALTON
jdaltonl@swarthmore.edu

After making some early waves with a 4-2 start, the
Garnet Tide have dropped below the .500 mark for the
first time this season. Losing three straight and
extending its winless streak to four games, the men's
soccer team has undoubtedly struggled recently. The
Tide currently stands at 4-5-1 overall and 0-2 in conference play, after falling to the GreenTerror of McDaniel
College 3-2 in double overtime.
The Garnet Tide looked to Saturday's homecoming
game against McDaniel as an opportunity to regroup
and surge back into the Centennial Conference title
race. A rough three-game road trip dropped the Tide
back to .500, after a tie with Philadelphia Biblical
University and losses to Neumann College and nationally ranked Johns Hopkins University. The loss to
Neumann was especially disheartening and frustrating for the team, considering the high level of intensity and preparation that went into the practices before
the game.
"Wednesday's game at Neumann had been devastating. We took the next day off and did a lot of thinking about that game. We had a great practice on Friday
that did a lot to restore our confidence," captain Cam
MacDearmid 'O3 explained.

But despite coming out with a lot of energy on
Saturday, the Tide fell behind early, as McDaniel
jumped out to an early 1-0 lead. At just 2:17 into the
game, Tom Kane scored on a deflected pass from Steve
Lennox, which the defense failed to clear from the
backfield. The Green Terror took the 1-0 advantage
into the half, as the Garnet defense was unable to sustain constant pressure on the opposing backs.
The second half was a different story for the most
part. After McDaniel made it 2-0 on a Todd Knepper
goal 2:21 into the second half, the Garnet picked up
their intensity and rallied to eventually tie the game at
two. Forward Charlie Taylor 'O6 made a run into the
box in the 73rd minute and was fouled, setting up a
John Tuthill 'O6 penalty kick score. His first career
goal sliced the Green Terror's lead in half with 17 min-

THE PHOENIX

utes left to play in regulation. Midfielder Nick Graham
'O6 scored the equalizer 4:18 later, volleying his first
career goal into the back of the net and sending the

game into overtime.
"Despite being down 2-0 in the early stages of the
second half, we did well in picking up our intensity to
get the two goals back," Graham said. "We really managed to push forward in the half and create some good
opportunities as Reuben [Heyman-Kantor 'o6] made
some fine saves to keep us in the game."
After battling back and forth through both halves
of regulation and the first overtime period, the Garnet
Tide eventually fell to the Green Terror 2:56 into the
second overtime. Leon Mach exploited a Garnet defensive lapse, picking up a loose ball and feeding Tom
Kane for his second goal of the game, this one for the
game-winner.

MacDearmid remained optimistic about the loss,
but still kept the outcome in perspective. "We showed
some fight in being able to come back two goals down
and send the game into overtime," he said. "That was
encouraging and speaks for the desire that we have to
win. The result was disappointing because we put in a
good effort and good fight, but we did not play well
individually and collectively. They were a team that
we were better than.
"We need to combine the energy and toughness that
we showed against McDaniel with the smart tactical
and technical ability that we had shown previously.
We will stay positive and will continue to work hard."
Graham added, "Although losing is never easy, I
think we can come away from this game positively,
knowing that if we continue to play with a high intensity level, have a little luck and make sure we play well
defensively, we can win our upcoming games and end
the season with a .500 record or better."
MacDearmid believes the Garnet's best ball is yet
to come. "We can't dwell on these last three losses, but
we're looking to knock off Ursinus on Wednesday," he

said. "The fact that we played poorly against McDaniel
and were still able to send the game into overtime
indicates to me that we have the ability to do some real
damage when we start clicking."
October 3, 2002

The true obsession takes place during the week, as well; for
it is during those five days in which football cannot be found on
the television that I indulge in NCAA Football 2003 for PS2. Li'l
Chrissy, Wheels and I play out our three-team dynasty, each of
us attempting to lead Michigan, USC or Penn State to the national championship. We play the games (quite well, too), make roster changes and in the off season, we recruit.
We hit the pavement, sending our digital coaches on visits to
digital prospects' houses, all in the hopes of making our digital

universities a tad bit better. The players are the backbone of the
university over the course of my tenure, and each becomes
quite special to me. Laugh all you want. I have a three-year contract, and unless I win the Big Ten twice, I get fired. Compare
that to your Micro midterm.
Last night absolutely captures my existence. I sat there
throwing cheese balls at the television as Randy Moss continually dropped pass after pass. Didn't he know that his Daunte
Culpepper is my quarterback too? WHY?!!!! And the only thing I
could think about was how Trent Green had already thrown for
five touchdowns and was riding my bench. Would this cost me a
win? Would I drop in the standings? Would all pride be lost?
Oh God, bring me the Pepto for my ulcer and a nice pillow for
my head. I need a nap, because all this work has made me tired.

Tide stun undefeated McDaniel 1-0
BY DERRICK WU
dwul@swarthmore.edu

The Garnet Tide opened their
Centennial Conference schedule with two
wins, shocking previously undefeated
McDaniel 1-0 on Saturday, Sept. 28, and
defeating Tri-College rival Bryn Mawr 5-0
on Tuesday, Oct. L
With three nationally ranked teams in
No. 7 Ursinus,
No. 11 McDaniel and No. 13 Johns Hopkins
each conference win is an important
step towards the team's goal of claiming
the conference championship. During
Saturday's game, a rock solid defense got
Swarthmore off on the right foot as it shut
out McDaniel 1-0 at the team's homecoming game.
"It definitely was a big game. First of
all, it was our first conference game,"
Helen Leitner 'O4 said. "McDaniel is also a
nationally ranked team, so it made the win
even bigger for us. There were a lot of reasons for us to play hard, and we did."
McDaniel opened the game at a furious
pace. "A lot of the game was played in the
midfield," Emily Szydlowski 'O5 said. "We
played really, really well. They came out
really fast; we were able to pick up the

the stacked conference

match them."

Szydlowski scored the eventual gamewinning goal in the first half. "All of the
offense was in the circle and I was toward
the top left of the circle. The ball got
pushed to me from my left and I pushed it
to the opposite corner," Szydlowski said.
"The goal was just a normal shot that
snuck by and in."
With defenders Katie Cloonan 'O3 and
Kasia Koziol-Dube 'O3 shutting down the
threat from the McDaniel frontline, keeper
Kate Nelson-Lee 'O3 preserved the one-goal
lead by turning away all eight shots she
faced. "Katie and Kasia are like a wall back
there," Chelsea Ferrell 'O5 said.
"The whole defense is always really
impressive. They did a great job of holding
McDaniel scoreless, which no other team
has done," Szydlowski said.
Homefield advantage was also an important factor in Swarthmore's victory.
"Unfortunately we're having some trouble
with our field. There's some dead patches,
so the field can change the play of the game.
It's kind of good because it frustrates other
teams. No matter what, we know our field,"
Leitner said. "We also had a lot of fans that
came out to support us. It's great to have
fans come out, it reminds us of why we're
doing it."
The Tide stretched their Centennial
Conference record to 2-0 on Tuesday by
defeating Bryn Mawr 5-0. Nelson-Lee
stopped all five Bryn Mawr shots to record
her third consecutive shutout and extend
her scoreless streak to 215 minutes. For her
efforts, Nelson-Lee was named the

Player of the Week. "Kate is an amazing
goalie. She is

a commanding force on the

field," Leitner said. "We play teams where

some goalies just kind of sit back. Kate is
confident and intimidating. When there's a
shot on goal, she's going to stop it."
On the offensive end, Leitner

and

Ferrell scored two goals apiece and Meg
Woodworth 'O3 added a goal and an assist.
"Every goal that was scored today was a
team effort," Leitner said. "One thing that
I've really been pleased with, as an offen-

the scoring and the defensive backbone."

"Heather and Katherine are really awesome

midfielders. A lot of play takes play at the midfield, so they're sprinting back and forth.
They're an important link," Ferrell added.
"Heather and Katherine always work amazingly hard. As midfielders they don't tend to get
the stats," Szydlowski said.
With two midfielders anchoring the
center of play, the offense has been able to

"We all think we're good enough to
make an impression on the conference and win
it," Szydlowski added. "People may be more
aware that we're here now It will be interesting
to play other teams that might have expected to
beat us."
"I always felt like we started the season
strong. Our record doesn't show it, but we knew
we were playing strong and we were playing
tough teams," Leitner said. "I feel like we're
starting a new phase of the season. I'm excited,
