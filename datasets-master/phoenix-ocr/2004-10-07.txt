Parrish pipe fire causes minor damage
Eight fire companies arrive on scene, prank call leads to another alarm Wednesday afternoon
BY CHRISTINA TEMES

ctemesl@swarthmore.edu

According the Thayer, the fire was isolated. "The
fire was strictly confined to the paper jacket of the
insulation It burned like a cigarette. It just slowly
crept up," Thayer said.
Hansen said the insulation around the pipes were
burning. "I believe the contractors were working on
the pipes, using some sort of torch," he said.
The fire department received the call at 3:58 p.m.,
and eight local fire companies responded, according
to Hansen. "The damage was very minimal... [since]
the building was under construction anyway. Other
than tearing apart a few walls to extinguish the fire"
and to check to make sure the fire was out, "there
was no structural damage, no smoke and very little
water damage," Hansen said.
Public Safety officers "oversaw the evacuation
and directed the fire companies to the site initially,
and [they] made sure people were out and didn't
enter until the fire department was done," according
...

Parrish Hall was evacuated Tuesday afternoon
after a small fire was discovered in Parrish North,
which is currently under construction.
The fire started when a plumber from an outside

contractor was soldering pipe earlier on Tuesday,
according to Director of Maintenance Ralph Thayer.
The paper jacket on the outside of the pipe insulation
caught fire. But, according to Thayer, the fire was
put out and the site was checked several times
throughout the day.

"It burned like a cigarette. It
just slowly crept up."
Ralph Thayer
director of maintenance
However, "when the [construction] supervisor
did a final walkthrough, he smelled smoke," Thayer
said. The supervisor called facilities, reporting the
"smoke condition" at 3:45 p.m. Facilities then called
the fire department. "We [also] made the decision to
pull the alarm and clear the building," Thayer said.
Public Safety received notice of the fire at 3:57
p.m., Director of Public Safety Owen Redgrave said.
According to Redgrave, Public Safety then contacted
the fire department and dispatched all available officers to the scene.
The fire originated from pipes in the first floor
ceiling of Parrish North and traveled via the pipes to
the second floor, according to Fire Chief Chris
Hansen of the Swarthmore Fire Company.

to Redgrave.
Officer Joseph G. Maginnis of the Swarthmore
Police Department was working Tuesday and was
notified of the fire at 4:10 p.m. on Tuesday by the
Delaware County Emergency Dispatch Center,
according to Police Chief Brian Craig. Maginnis
arrived on the scene at 4:11 p.m.
"The officer's role [in the fire] was to make sure
everyone's safe and make sure everyone's staying
out of the way of the fire fighters," Craig said. This is
because "the location doesn't require much in terms
of directing traffic," he added.
Maginnis' report on the fire stated that the fire
was started by a contractor doing plumbing work
earlier in the afternoon. However, the report said the

Economist rails against Bush economic policy in speech
BY BENJAMIN KABAK

bkabakl@swarthmore.edu

Joseph Stiglitz, winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize in
Economics, had a message for President George W. Bush:
The much-heralded tax cuts did not work. In fact, according to Stiglitz, no economist would believe that the Bush
tax cuts were designed to spur on the staggering United
States economy.
On Monday, Stiglitz addressed a packed crowd in the
Science Center lecture hall, preaching largely to the converted on "Economics and the Election." For over an hour,
Stiglitz railed on the Bush administration's plans for economic recovery, saving his most acrimonious critique for
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
For much of the evening, Stiglitz dissected the arguments in favor of the Bush tax cut. He began by debunking
the current administration's claims that the economy has
actually grown over the past three years. While it is true
that the economy has grown by about three percent a year
since 2001, Stiglitz did not believe that this was significant
growth. "Three percent is just running enough to stand
still, and what we have been seeing is a rising unemployment rate," he said. "The economy seems to reflect a
choice of more unemployment and less growth."
Moving on to the specifics of the tax cut, Stiglitz
mocked the theory behind giving money back to only the
richest in society. "It's called trickle-down economics, and
it's not true," he said. "It's not true in the 80s, and it's not

George W. Bush's economic policies.

true today."
Following his critique of the tax cuts, Stiglitz laid the
blame for America's economics problems squarely on the
Bush administration. Explaining the need for investing in
research and development, Stilglitz noted how Bush's tax
cut did not provide for any long-term investments that
would stimulate the economy in the future. "It was an
achievement to provide so little stimulus," he said.
Furthermore, Stiglitz noted that the United States was

October 7, 2004

contributing to "enormous global financial instability" by
borrowing nearly SLS billion a day from various global

markets. With volatile exchange rates and a vulnerable
economy, Stiglitz noted that American households were
facing increasing bankruptcy rates and more indebtness.
"It's the world you are inheriting," he said. "It's not a rosy
picture, and I doing think we're about to turn the corner.
That doesn't look very good for Bush."
In closing, Stiglitz issued his most blatant critique of
the Bush strategy. "Tax cuts for the rich," he said, "are not
the solution to every economic policy."
Following his speech, Stiglitz responded to numerous
questions from the audience. Portraying more of his proJohn Kerry, pro-liberal bias, Stiglitz was quick to praise the
Democratic presidential hopeful's economic plan. "Kerry's
economic policies would remedy much of the problems I
described," he said. "There are some losers in this change,
but I think economic performance would be enhanced."
Finally, Stiglitz saved his harshest critique for an
attack on Greenspan. Responding to a question about
Greenspan's inconsistent economic positions over the
years, Stiglitz launched into an attack against the chair of
the Federal Reserve. "The arguments Greenspan made
were among the worst I've ever heard from a public official," he said.
Greenspan, Stiglitz noted, had said that a zero-deficit
situation would have been bad for the American economy.
"Congress would have found a way in this emergency to
get the debt up again," Stiglitz responded, with a hint of
sarcasm in his voice. "Greenspan has a very partisan and
political agenda: Downsize the government. By encouraging deficits, the tax cut and spending cuts, the agenda
seems to be perfectly clear."
Following the speech, economics professor Bernard
Saffran praised Stiglitz for his delivery. "It was obvious
what side he was on, but I thought he was trying to represent his own views and not give a political diatribe,"
Saffran said. "It wasn't a partisan speech."

Students win suit against e-voting company
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY BENJAMIN BRADLOW
bbradlol@swarthmore.edu
After six months of waiting for a decision in a lawsuit he filed with Luke Smith
'O6 and the Online Policy Group, an internet service provider, Nelson Pavlosky 'O6
"was literally caught napping" when the
decision was announced last Thursday.
Pavlosky and Smith had won their case
against Diebold Election Systems, a manufacturer ofelectronic voting machines, and
the company will be required to pay court
costs and lawyer fees.
"We'd been waiting so long, I kind of forgot about [the case]," Pavlosky said. Upon
awaking from his nap he was greeted by a
message from Wired News asking for his

thoughts on the decision.
Judge Jeremy Fogel of the U.S. District

for the Northern District of
California ruled in favor of Pavlosky,
Smith and the OPG in their complaint
against Diebold. The suit alleged that
Diebold unfairly used provisions of the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act to prevent them from posting a series of internal
company memos that exposed flaws in
Court

Diebold's voting machines.
The memos consisted of a series of email messages between technical support
personnel and sales representatives at
Diebold discussing problems with their

machines. The messages seemed to advocate Diebold representatives falsify security demonstrations for elections officials, as
well as outlining security flaws in
machines which had already been implemented in election precincts around the

by the Online Policy Group because they
were the ISP for the San Francisco Bay

Area Indymedia Web site. Micah White 'O5,
a member of Why War?, posted a link from
Indymedia to the memos, and Diebold
threatened the OPG for hosting a page that
linked to the memos.
According to Granick, the decision,
which she called "a victory for free

country. As of 2003, 37 states had contracts
to use Diebold machines.
When a member of the on-campus group
Why War? posted the memos on the group's
Web site, Diebold threatened their ISP with
a copyright infringement suit. Why War?
then moved the memos to a computer on
the college network, which the college disabled after receiving a similar warning

speech," has two major points.
The first is that Pavlosky's and Smith's
"use of the Diebold memos was fair use."
The most common conception of fair use is
using a small portion of a larger work for

from Diebold.

Pavlosky and Smith then posted the
memos to the Web site of the Swarthmore
Coalition for the Digital Commons, and
when Diebold threatened them, they
launched a civil suit against the corpora-

tion.

Lawyers from the San Francisco-based

Electronic

Frontier Foundation and
Jennifer Granick of the Cyberlaw Clinic at
Stanford University offered to represent
Pavlosky and Smith free of charge.
The suit was the first to test section
512(f) of the DMCA, which stipulates that it
is illegal to knowingly misuse the copyright act to try to suppress free speech,
Pavlosky said.
The students were joined in their case

citation or review. But three other criteria
for fair use are also recognized under the
law: If there is a public interest in making
the material available; if the material is not
marketable enough that the copyright hold-

er would be losing potential profit from the
creation; or if those sharing the material
are not trying to make money by sharing
the copyrighted material.
The second major tenet of the court's
decision was that "the DMCA protects
against false copyright allegations of copyright infringement," Granick said.
Currently, Internet service providers
are likely to acquiesce to a takedown
request because under the law they are
given immunity against prosecution
whereas if they allow the material to continue to be accessed, they leave themselves

Board discusses LW proposal, finances
BY REUBEN HEYMAN-KANTOR
rheymanl@swarthmore.edu
The Board of Managers dis-

cussed issues ranging from the living wage to the Capital Campaign
during their first meeting of the
year this past weekend, yet no
major decisions will be made until
their next meeting in December.
For the first time, the Board of
Managers heard President Al

Bloom's proposal, which would
allow employees to use "benefit
bank" money for income rather
than having to purchase health-

care.

Bloom presented his plan last
weekend during the board's first

meeting of the year. The meeting
focused primarily on Bloom's proposal on the living wage issue, the
progress of the Capital Campaign
and the visibility campaign.
"It was not planned that there
would be a lot of decision-making,
and there usually isn't at the first
board weekend of the year," Vice
President Maurice Eldridge '6l
said.
After meeting in committees
Friday morning, the entire board
met during the afternoon to discuss Bloom's proposal. "All in all,
[the board members] do trust Al
[Bloom]," Student Council CoPresident Andrew Gisselquist 'O5
said. "The viewpoints [of the
board members] were widely dispersed, but the board was generally receptive," he said.
Board members were particularly receptive to Bloom's call for
increased healthcare benefits.
"I think that the board discussion was very fruitful, that they
listened to the faculty proposal,
they listened to the student
reports, they listened to the

4

reports of the staff," political science professor Cynthia Halpern,
one of the two faculty observers,

said.

"Al's proposal was very helpful, and we're well on our way to
trying to understand how to reach
some consensus on this issue," she
said.
The proposal, with modifications if the board chooses to
amend it, will be voted on during
the next meeting on Dec. 4,
Gisselquist said.
Some action will certainly be
taken with regard to the proposal
before the board passes next
year's budget at the group's third
meeting in February, Eldridge
said.
The board members and faculty attended a cocktail reception
Friday evening, after which part
"Meaning
of
the
new
of
Swarthmore" DVD was shown.
The DVD, filmed on campus last
year, will be sent to prospective
students this October to give a
sense of what life at Swarthmore
is like.
"I thought the film had a certain charm and accuracy," religion professor Steven Hopkins, a
faculty observer, said.
"[The board] found it, I think,

and interesting,"
Eldridge said. "I think each of us
was trying to imagine ourselves as
a 17-year-old," he added.
On Saturday morning minor
decisions were made, including
small in-year changes to the budget and the approval of an audit of
last year's finances.

Each committee then reported

on its respective work. The investment committee reported that the
endowment was in good shape at
over $1 billion, though it cau-

tioned that the endowment is not
expected to perform

as well as it

did during the mid-nineties with
regards to stability

of growth.

The rest of the meeting was
spent discussing the Capital
Campaign and urging board members to either contribute more
financially or work harder to find
other alumni who would be willing to contribute.
The campaign, begun privately
in 1999 and launched publicly in
2001, started out with the goal of
raising $230 million over a sevenyear period. Included in that goal
is $2O million for the annual fund,
which is used for the year-to-year
running of the college.
Alumni participation is currently at 52 percent, Eldridge said.
"We've got gifts and pledges of
about $l6B million, and so we have
about $62 million more to raise"
over the next two years and three
months," Eldridge said. "We're
making good progress, I think."
Forty-three percent of the
donations received for the Capital
Campaign have come from current or former managers, accord-

ing to Eldridge.
Each year the board meets four
times to discuss issues ranging

from technology improvements to
construction projects to fundraising. The board also passes the
annual budget and elects the pres-

ident of the college.
The board is comprised of 33
members. All members serve on at
least one of the nine committees,
though many managers serve on

two.
Managers are generally chosen
for their commitment to the college and their ability and willingness to give money or call on fellow alumni, according to Eldridge.

said.
Now, if a corporation does engage in
false allegations of copyright infringement,

sued and pay damages," Granick said.
Granick argued that Diebold made the
threat without having a fair claim under
copyright law. "[Diebold] knew

should have known that it wasn't a legitimate complaint," she said.
The court ordered Diebold to pay

lawyers' fees along with damages.

for the case from the Electronic

amount of these will be argued soon.
Seltzer and Cindy Cohn of the EFF joined

Alumna struck by car, hospitalized
Lauren Appei 'O4 was hit by a car while riding her bike
through Phiiadeiphia on Sept 10.
According to Dean of Academic Resources Karin Carter, who
has been in close contact with Appel's father, Appei is now "alert
and recognizing people, though she wasn't able to talk due to
her jaw being wired after the reconstructive surgery."
After the accident, doctors initially thought that her injuries
were fatal and that she would sustain vision loss and brain damage. Due to broken bones on the left side of Appel's face, she
had to undergo reconstructive surgery. Though Appei was still in
intensive care the last time Carter talked to her family, she is
supposed to move to a neurological rehabilitation center within
the next few days.
Appel's father thought she would enjoy visits from friends,
now that she is able to recognize people.
"They are grateful for the cards and flowers sent by her
friends here, and he wanted me to thank everyone for keeping
her and their family in our thoughts and prayers," Carter said.
Students who would like to send Appei cards or flowers
should send them to: Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, 111

Uncovering antiquity
Tyler Lyson renews interest in Swarthmore paleontology after a century in cold storage
BY BEN OLDFIELD
boldfiel@swarthmore.edu

Tyler Lyson 'O6 has rekindled
Swarthmore's tradition for excellence in paleontology, which lay
dormant for the past century.
Born and raised in Marmath,
North Dakota, Lyson has fossilfinding in his blood. His hometown is on the Hell Creek formation of North Dakota's southwest

corner, the last rock formation to

form before the extinction of the
dinosaurs.
He remembers trips when he
was young with his uncles out on
his relatives' land to search for
arrowheads and other American
Indian artifacts. These days, his
work has included the finding of a
completely mummified dinosaur
with its skin intact, of which only
two or three are known in the
world, and the discovery of a new
turtle species that lived 65 million
years ago.
With the help of Greenhouse
Manager Bill Pinder, who directed the paleontology prep lab of the

Academy of Natural Sciences of
Philadelphia in the 1980s and
19905, Lyson has been able to
bring his work to Swarthmore.

Lyson sends the pieces he
finds to the college, where he and
Pinder treat them and prepare

them for display and analysis,

after which they are sent back to
North Dakota. Their work is facilitated by biology professor Scott
Gilbert and is funded by grants
from
the
National
Science
Foundation and faculty research,
according to Gilbert.

"Tyler is one of
America's leading
paleontologists
today."
Bill Pinder

"Tyler is

one of America's

said Pinder. "He just needs the
paperwork to catch up with him."
This distinction, however, is
not new for the college. According
to Pinder, Joseph Leidy, the
founder of the Academy, brought

was appointed professor of natural sciences in 187
L
Leidy founded Swarthmore's
biology department and was "one

of the most important biologists
in America. Scientists from
around the world came to the
country to see him," Gilbert said.
Pinder also acknowledged

of paleontology. Leidy was the

A small museum of Leidy's
pieces was once in Parrish Annex,
a building that originally stood

where Kohlberg is now located.
Now, Lyson and Pinder do
their work in Martin, where there

currently are a piece of the afore-

mentioned mummified edmontosaur and parts of a new species
of pachycepholasaur, a headbutting dinosaur, turtle shells

and other fossils.

In his remaining years here,

Lyson hopes to incite a greater

will be to preserve fossils found
near his hometown and keep them
in North Dakota, as well as to educate the public on paleontology
and take school groups to the
field. By taking private groups out
on his land to do digs themselves,
he has raised approximately
$26,000 so far to launch MRF.
With funding from the biology
department, Lyson traveled to
Mongolia this summer for several
weeks to dig.
Although the Hell Creek formation is perhaps the best area in the
nation for paleontology, Pinder
said, certain regions in Mongolia
and China are "the Mecca of paleontology," according to Lyson.
During the summer of 2003,
Lvson

took a group of students and faculty to his home in North Dakota

to excavate. Among the group was

Gilbert, as well as Dean Bob

Gross '62 and Dean of Admissions
and Financial Aid Jim Bock '9O.
"Only Tyler could have gotten
Bob and Jim out in the 104 degree

joked. According to Gilbert,
whose pictures of the trip include
Gross sliding down a rocky crag
on his bottom, the group excavated on Lyson's family's land, traveling in the back of a pickup truck
on roads that Lyson and his
brother had made.
A biology major, Lyson hopes
to continue his studies after
Swarthmore. "I'd like to go to a
paleontology program, hopefully
at the University of Chicago,
Berkeley, or Yale, all of which
have good programs," he said.

EMTs optimistic
about new recruits
BY JEEYOUNG OH
johl@swarthmore.edu
An increase in the number of prospective Emergency
Medical Technicians has calmed fears of an EMT shortage this

semester.
Last year, nine of 12 active volunteer EMTs graduated and
their departure alarmed many about prospects of the program.
Regardless of the concern over the lack of new recruits, there
are more than 20 active members working with the firehouse

this semester.

In response to the decline in the number of prospect EMTs in
the past years, the senior members devised a recruitment plan.
"During the activity fair in the beginning of the school year, we
had an ambulance and a fire truck on the campus. That was a
big thing," senior EMT Mark Hanis 'O5 said.
In addition to the efforts to increase the visibility of the EMT
program, the returning and new students showed a great inter-

est.
"There are a huge number of enthusiastic volunteers at the
end of last year and this year. There are about 10 to 15 volunteers, including both college students and locals, who submitted
an application to be a member right now," Ambulance
Lieutenant Kate Groner 'O5 said.
"I was an EMT in my high school. It was a great hands-on
experience to learn about medicine. I'm glad that I can continue it at Swarthmore," said Elena Chopyak 'OB, who submitted
an application and had an interview last week for a membership. "I'm really looking forward to working with the local fire-

house."

According to EMT Erica Deray 'O6, Firehouse Station 14,
located in the Ville across from Co-Op, is mostly staffed by volunteers. In addition to Swarthmore students, volunteers consist
of adults who are local residents, a few students from high
schools and Swarthmore graduates who have remained in the

area.

Over the summer, 10 to 15 students trained either on campus
or in their hometown. Some fire departments paid for their
training, which gave an incentive for students to get involved
in their home states and become EMTS at Swarthmore. Many of
them became the certified members and have continued their
duties after returning, according to Groning and Hanis.
Currently, nine students are enroUed in EMT class.
Only Yafeng Li 'OB joined the membership before starting his
first year at college. Most of the time, first-years are not allowed
to take a class for the first semester. They are not members yet,
and they are not familiar with the work and equipment of
Emergency Medical Service when they start at college. Once
they become members, they go through a training program,

Groner said.
Interested in recruiting more college students to the program, Hanis plans to create a chartered student group at
Swarthmore.
"As of now, it is all individual. There is no meeting or budget or anything like that," Hanis said. "Swarthmore Emergency
Medical Service will hold weekly meetings like other clubs and
set up a Blackboard site to enhance communication. The student group will create the sense of community."
Once a prospective EMT fiUs out informational forms, such
as health record, the volunteer will be called for an interview
with the committee.
After a month, the committee members vote if applicants
will become members, and, if membership is extended, the volunteer becomes a provisionary member. The volunteer will
then go through training in the firehouse which is located near
the borough business district.
An EMT will have two or three evening classes a week, and
a fire fighting class takes place all day on Sunday every week,

Groner said.

"Not only when they are on call but also when they are free,
we encourage [EMTs] just to come down and hang out with people. You get to know your co-workers. You'll work more efficiently and have more fun doing it," Groner said.
When a prospective EMT is inducted as a member and
acquires CPR certification, he or she can run on the ambulance.
An ambulance crew includes a driver, crew chief, and up to two
other people.
EMTs can perform skills such as taking vitals, splinting and

bandaging.
After running a fair number of calls and duties, an EMT is
eligible to become a crew chief. The crew chief is in charge of
the overall call, making sure everybody knows what is going on
and what needs to be done, Darey said.

in 1999 as part of the town's economic revitalization plan and
attracted renewed interest in May
2001 when a town referendum narrowly passed, permitting the
granting of liquor licenses for the

inn and other restaurants.

Since then, however, the issue
has not had much public interest
and had seemingly disappeared
from the plans of the borough and
the college.
Jacobs, however, said "people

on zoning code changes over the
past three years.
College Vice President Larry
Schall '75 agreed. "The recent
decision of the Borough Council is
actually something they have
been working on for close to two
years, I believe," he said in an email.
Gerner said interest had
declined because construction of
the new Co-Op has been of primary importance to the town in
the past two years.
He also said, however, that he
"would've liked to see the issue
move forward a long time ago,"
because the inn would be "a positive thing for the town."
But Schall said the college does
not have any upcoming plans for
the inn.
"While [the passing of the ordinance] will certainly make it possible, at least in this one respect,
for a project like the inn to move
forward, there are many otheriactors at work," Schall said.
"We look forward to continuing our conversation with the borbut at this moment, we do

Fire causes Parrish evacuation

Two medic units, in addition to the police and
Public Safety, were on the scene, according to Craig.
Redgrave said the number of emergency services
that responded to the scene was standard, since there
is a plan in place of "the appropriate resources [dispatched] for size and occupancy of a building."

"I was mad because I was trying

There were no problems with the evacuation,
according to Redgrave. People were allowed to reenter the building at 4:45 p.m., Thayer said.

for a math midterm later that day when the fire alarm
went off. "I was mad because I was trying to study and
It was very inconvenient for me,"

Green said.
Parrish resident Syeda Tasnim 'OB noted that hear-

ing fire alarms in Parrish is not unusual. "We've had
these alarms for a while," she said. "Usually it's at 1 or
2 in the morning, so we were lucky this time," Green
said.
Fire companies were dispatched to Parrish again

yesterday afternoon after a false alarm. According to
Redgrave, "there was a [call from a] very young
sounding person from a public telephone who said
there was a fire in Parrish."
The call was received by the Delaware County
Emergency Dispatch Center, and as the center was
transferring the call to fire authorities, the caller
hung up.
"It sounds like a classic prank," Redgrave said.
Public safety was notified of the incident at 5:14
p.m., according to dispatcher Frank Barbosa. The call
was not placed with a cell phone and originated from
off campus, according to Hansen. The fire department
considered the alarm a "malicious false call," Hansen

said.

No smoke alarms in Parrish were activated, but the
fire companies, the police department, emergency
medical services and Public Safety did respond.
"Upon investigation, there was no fire," Redgrave

said.

Committee issues report on Crum
mendations for future work with the Crum
Creek Valley, including a detailed break-

BY NICOLE KAST

nkastl@swarthmore.edu

A committee's report on the college's
property in the Crum Creek Valley warned
specifically against the "fragmentation" of
the woods by buildings and roads and recommended a permanent staff position to
monitor use of the area.
The Crum Woods Ad Hoc Stewardship
Committee submitted its final report on the
current state of Swarthmore's property in
the Crum Creek Valley last month.
The final report was the result of a twoyear-long study conducted by the Natural
Lands Trust and Continental Conservation

in conjunction with the committee.
A report that featured recommendations set forth by a group of outside consultants was completed in December 2003,
and since then "[the committee worked
with the Natural Lands Trust and
Continental Conservation to revise the
report and shape it to the college's needs
during this time," Jen Johnson 'O5, a student member of the committee, said in an email.
The report detailed the current uses of
the Crum Woods by the college, the possible threats to the Crum Creek Valley, suggestions for a monitoring program and
resource management and a list of recom-

down of possible management units.
Though the report was written with the
committee's input, the recommendations
were generally those of the consultants.
This report was released to the committee in February 2004, and the committee
met during the spring to address the recommendations of the consultants and create their own report. The committee's
report was submitted to Provost Constance
Hungerford in May 2004, and the final
report was released to the public in
September.
The report includes the committee's recommendations and concerns, many of
which correspond to those stated in the
consultants' report.
The report was designed to address concerns about threats to the Crum Valley and
to suggest ways to prevent future damage
and reverse environmental harm.
"The fragmentation of the woods and
threats to its ecological integrity is what
we see as the most important," McGarity

said.

"Roads and buildings

fragment the

woods and make it impossible for plants
and animals to move freely within their
environment. The woods are meant to be a
single entity," McGarity added.

Another important recommendation in
the final report involves the creation of a
staffposition of Crum Woods steward.
The Crum Woods steward would be in
charge of grounds management and would
coordinate any efforts by the college with
regards to the woods, including those
regarding research and teaching.
Though the Crum Woods Stewardship
Committee is not meant to be responsible
for the management of the Crum Woods,
the committee must deal with managerial
issues for the time being, because there is
no one else to consult, McGarity said.
In the past, the committee has met a few
times each semester to "review the nascent

Crum Woods report and discuss any issues
that arose related to stewardship and management of the woods," Johnson said.
Former Provost Jennie Keith formed
the Ad Hoc Committee in October 2000
when a faculty member raised concern that
future educational programs in the Crum
woods would be inhibited by unaddressed
threats to the property.
"The committee was formed to look at
the woods and evaluate its condition, measure its use internally and externally and
determine what the limits and liabilities
are," Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6l, a
committee member, said in an e-mail. The
committee includes administrators, profes-

Disillusioned by dolls

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

When I was a child,
the highlight of my days

would be the always fun
trips to the toy store.
However, as I ventured
into Kay-Bee Toys a
week ago, I was astonished as to find out what
a disgrace the toy industry is today. And I
assure you, this is not a
light matter. I happen to
think that when Polly

in my pocket, it is an

extremely serious issue.
I can't help but wonder,
Pop Life
is
this
,
how baby
boomers felt when their
Mr. Potato Heads were
replaced with Viewfinders and Lite-Brites? To be fair, not all
toys have changed. However, new products for girls leave
something to be desired. My adventures in toy land start

here.

Walking in the store, I turned down an aisle sacred to
young girls everywhere: dolls. Immediately I was inundated
in what appeared to be a Bratz invasion. Now if you're not up
on your toy lingo, then you might not understand the sheer
fad that are Bratz. Heart-shaped faces, full lips and a "passion for fashion" make girls gravitate towards them and
their line of over-priced accessories. To be fair, I have nothing against these new dolls. But as pure friendly advice, I
would suggest that parents forget the influence that Britney
Spears and her bare belly shimmying may have on your
daughter when she watches television. They might want to
exert useful energy on the fact that in the next room, little
Suzy is playing with a Bratz doll from the "Nighty Nite" collection, clad in lacy pink and black lingerie, with red pumps
to boot.

The fun doesn't stop there. Now kids can purchase accompanying Bratz Petz. On the shelves I found special edition
Tokyo Catz such as loveable Yukiko, which means
"Snowchild" (yes, they actually put this information on the
box). At this point, I wondered whether this was an attempt
to promote cultural diversity or Asian fetishes.
Mattel's answer to the Bratz is the equally disturbing My
Scene Barbie collection. These dolls are actually relatively
tame, except for their interesting names. You have Chelsea,
Delancey, Madison, Nolee, River, Sutton and Ellis. Now I
don't know about anyone else, but whatever happened to the
simple days of Skipper and Kelly? At least those were names
that kids could pronounce and didn't seem like they
belonged on the cover of Elle and GQ magazines. A case of
coolness gone wrong? I think so.
I figure Mattel had to make another line of products sim-

ply because the alternative was to keep banking on selling
random reject Barbie dolls. Case in point, the new Cool
Lookz Barbie: Trendy and Bendy. My first reaction was that
this is a questionable title for a doll for young girls. I look at
the packaging closer: "Special bendy hair holds any style!" I

never knew that hair could be described as "bendy," but
apparently that's what sells now.
After a disappointing browse down the doll aisle, I continued to look around and found my beloved icon of domesticity, the Easy Bake Oven. It is a shred of familiarity, until
I noticed that Hasbro has made a new and improved version.
This one is called an Easy Bake Real Meal Oven. Gone are
the days in which I gleefully pretended to be Betty Crocker
baking cakes and cookies for my mother, who for some reason always looked at my concoctions but never took a bite. In
its place are recipes and packages to make macaroni and
cheese, cinnamon rolls and pretzels. I felt betrayed. The
whole point of an Easy Bake Oven is to make disgusting
desserts for pretend play. What good is it to any young girl

now if they can make something like bad-tasting chicken?

I left the toy store feeling dejected. Even the comfort of a
Care Bear, Hello Kitty and My Little Pony comeback couldn't
console me. At least I can rest easy knowing that little boys
can still find hours of amusement with their staple Legos,
G.I. Joes and assorted action figures. After all, once you've
seen one Superman, you've seen them all.

Will it be Aydelotte? Franzen? The Kremlin? Students get inventive in naming the New Dorm.

Hi, I live in Dukakis
Students suggest creative new names for the New Dorm
BY ALYSSA WORK

aworkl@swarthmore.edu

It may be, technically, the newest dorm on campus,
but the building formerly known as the "New Dorm"
will soon be known by another moniker.
With a $6 million contribution by an anonymous
donor capping off the money needed for the completion
of the residence hall, the New Dorm is ready to try on
whatever name students, Al Bloom and the donor deem
best.
The problem just might be getting residents to call it
by that name.
"It doesn't matter to me that much," Tim Cronin 'O6
said of the dorm's name change. "It's kind of fun for it
not to have a name."

"It kind of looks like the Cliffs of
Insanity from The Princess Bride'
that would be a good name."
Mischa Stephens 'O6
...

Franzen 'B2) "because it's a cool name," but also noted
that "I don't think it's Quaker tradition to name a
building after a living alum."
Several students mentioned 1988 presidential candidate Michael Dukakis '55 as a potential namesake, but
few students expressed excitement about living in a
dorm named after the politician: "It's not anything personal against him," Cronin said. "I just think it's a horrible name."
Other students have proposed naming the dorm
after the influential Frank Aydelotte. As the seventh
president of Swarthmore in the 19205, Aydelotte developed Swarthmore's current image as an intellectually
prestigious school by introducing the honors program
and deemphasizing athletics.
The name of the dorm will ultimately be decided by
the donor after a period of open submissions by the student body. Eliana Bonifacino 'O7, however, thought that
the name should be decided by a student vote "because
it seems like a very Swarthmore thing to do."
Both residents and non-residents of the dorm are at
no loss for original name ideas.
"We could call it the Campus Hospital, because it
feels like a hospital," Stephens said. "Or 'Science
Center Prime'... and come to think of it, it kind of looks

like the Cliffs of Insanity from 'The Princess Bride'
that would be a good name."
Mischa Stephens 'O6 thought that it would take time
for any name to stick. The dorm's name may be a "big
deal" for students 10 years down the line, Stephens
said, "but for me it's fine calling it the New Dorm."
Some students, though, are already testing out
potential names for the dorm.
"Our hall voted to call it Super Cool Awesome

Land," Caitlin Butler 'O6 said. "It was just a first study
break thing, though I haven't really thought about it
...

since."

Cronin, on the other hand, said he had been recent-

ly "tossing out names" with friends at dinner.

"Before the entire thing about the names started, we

joked about calling it the 'L' because it's shaped like an
L," Cronin said. He suggested calling the dorm
"Franzen" (after "The Corrections" author Jonathan

October 7, 2004

...

Nathaniel Peters 'O7 lives in Willets but hopes that
"somebody can come up with a good name that's not
serious but not totally ridiculous. 'The Kremlin,'
maybe, in the spirit of our political ideology."
Then there's the omnipresent nickname "Kalafus,"
which is widespread enough that the pizza delivery guy
knows it, Peters said.
"It's good as a temporary name," Cronin said, "but
it just doesn't seem appropriate at all to name it after a

student."
"It would be great if it had an official name, but also
a nickname," Stephens said. "To have that duality
would cool."
Whatever name is chosen in the end, Butler said, "I
think people are used to it being the 'New Dorm.' I think
people will keep calling it the 'New Dorm' for a while."

More is more in fashion this fall
laces and mink stoles (because we all have
a mink just lying around). Layer on luxurious mix-and-match cuts, fabrics and textures to achieve a look that is both refined
and fun.

Though this new emphasis on modest
dress seems to have appeared from
nowhere, it has actually been lurking on
the horizon for some time. It's merely a continuation of the excessive and decidedly
pretty styles that have been en vogue since
the death of the slovenly, minimalist
nineties mess that we affectionately call
"grunge." The anti-grunge of years past and
the 80s aesthetic of bright colors, loud

DANA SEAY
Hip-ocrite
For years, we members of the fairer sex

have trembled under the fashion paradigm
of "less is more." In our love-hate relationship with icons like Britney Spears, we
sucked in our stomachs and pushed out our
chests, squeezing into thong-exposing low-

rider jeans and teeny-tiny tank tops. Alas,
to the chagrin of boys and sketchy men
everywhere, I'm here to declare that the
days when women dressed like newly
pubescent teenybopper girls are over. This
year marks the dawning of a new age of
lady-like glamour.
What, pray tell, does this stylistic shift
entail? Throw out your tube top and replace
it with a blouse. That's right, a blouse. Pair
this foreign piece of apparel with a pencil
skirt, and voila, you've captured the
essence of this fall's style. Timeless, conservative pieces set you apart from the teenybopper crowd and leaves plenty of room for
opulent embellishments, like pearl neck-

accessories, and synthetic fabrics seem to
bear little resemblance to the lady-like fashion du jour. But au contraire. Look a little

closer and the connection is unmistakably
clear: Excess is excess, whether it comes in

lace or Lycra.
For a little inspiration and guidance,
there are an array of designers who prove
just how hot it can be to dress like your
grandma. Perennial favorite Marc Jacobs
embraced the naughty librarian look for
this year's fall line with his ever-inventive
mix of high-end fabrics, retro nods and
quirky touches. Or, check out the work of
newcomer Peter Som, who gathered inspi-

ration from the cinematic cult-classic,
"Grey Gardens." The Peter Som woman
clusters antique brooches on her unravel-

ing tweed jacket, sports elbow-length
gloves, and indulges in midmorning martinis. If this isn't the stuff of fashion dreams,
I don't know what is.
Pearls and pencil skirts too demure for
you? Not to worry. Fashion is about sex, and
no amount of tweed is going to change that.
Every coquette knows

that the more you
have on, the more you have at your disposal
to remove seductively. Every accessory

draws attention to a different body part, so
accent your favorite asset at will: stockings
for killer legs, pill box hat for striking features, gobs of necklaces for pretty decolletage. Seemingly simple pieces, when cut
correctly, have more sex appeal than you
would think. Take the pencil skirt. The knee
length makes it modest, but its hip-hugging
fit makes it nearly impossible not to strut.
Pretty undergarments are totally in line
with this year's emphasis on femininity, so
who says your lacy unmentionables have to
stay hidden from the world? Negliges and
slips make great dresses, simultaneously
sweet and sultry. There are plenty of ways to
tart it up and still keep with this more
refined, adult mode of dress.

Not a girly girl? Not a problem. The look
works best when you punk it up a bit, incorporating boyish pieces into your prim and
proper attire. I, for one, refuse to admit that
Avril Lavigne has forever corrupted the
men's tie
it still adds a fun touch to an
otherwise feminine outfit. Rockabillyinspired hairstyles, like the bouffant, also
keep feminine dress from looking too stuffy.
Plus, it is one of the lesser-known joys in
life to tease your hair in the mirror while
boogying to Bowie's "Rebel Rebel." Finally,
everyone should own an oversized piece of
men's clothing. Whether it's a big dress
shirt or baggy trousers to be paired with a
frilly tank top, mixing in an overtly masculine piece is surprisingly sexy.
In years past, the general fashion rule of

Beep Beep
Business Casual
I'm not going to lie to you. The first time I heard Beep
Beep's new album, "Business Casual," I couldn't decide
whether to duck and cover or kick my boom box in anger.
The sound emanating from the speakers was something
-

between the whine of a dentist drill and that terrible band
your brother used to be in. Yeah, that one.
And it's not that Beep Beep's new album is particularly bad. The playing is proficient and the lyrics well written. The first three tracks, "I Am The Secretary," "Oh
No!" and "Misuse Their Bodies," stand out for the speed
and complexity of the band's accompaniment, and drive
the album forward early on
but perhaps too much.
Besides Eric Bemberger's particular vocal styling, the
album is hard to listen to because there's just so much
going on that doesn't fit together. Rather than create a
cacophony of sound, the band somehow manages to make
a collection of crystal clear jabs, each sound as painfully
coherent as the other three that are playing on top of it.
According to the band, "Business Casual" is an
attempt to explore and expose "office culture, as well as
religious, environmental, and sexual deviance." Okay. If
you can get through the album in one sitting, that theme
is noticeable and played out in some cleverly written
lyrics and tense playing, as I said before. It's just that
"Business Casual" takes a real commitment and an open
mind, perhaps more open than I possess, to appreciate.
For as much as I can enjoy the specific parts of this
album, I find the whole both grating and unpleasant.
Brian Howe, writer for Pitchfork reviews, brought up the

THE PHOENIX

idea that this band must be incredible live, and I can see
why he would believe it so. While the distinct pieces that
make up this album are somehow presented too clearly
and decisively, hearing them played live with the dampening effects and general excitement and hysteria of a
concert setting would suit them best, and show Beep Beep
to be a pretty kick-ass band that just needs take it down a

notch when mastering their next album.
The Court & Spark
Witch Season

-

Dead Diamond River Ep and

Of all the masterful playing on the album, Tom
Heyman's pedal steel-guitar playing stands out particularly for me, especially on "Dead Diamond River." His

slide work stretches out over the other instruments like

the desert sky, his long sustained lines streaked like
cloud strata. As flaky as that last sentence was, I stand by
it and the fact that everyone in the band finds a way to
play as if they were the region they represent. The music
is a perfect fit and requires no explanation or preamble.
Joe is a junior. You can reach him at jkillel@swarthmore.edu.

While Beep Beep presented complex music as a separated, dissident whole, The Court & Spark play as if they
have no choice but to be cohesive. The music on their
Dead Diamond River ep and full-length album, "Witch
Season," is magnificent because of the understated playing and the expression of the band. The songwriting is
honest and understated. On both discs, they successfully
recreate the American Southwest, playing with the prescribed sounds of the region's music, as well as creating
a new language for their instruments
a perfect estimation of what contemporary music would be if its performers' main concern was not getting a record deal or touring, but allowing their music time to grow and ferment.
The Court & Spark's music is aged flawlessly.

"Dead Diamond River" compliments "Witch Season"
perfectly. It is a small slice of what the band can do, showing a more subdued and simple approach to their songwriting and arrangement. Tracks like "Lucia" and "Bar
the Door, Davy" are sweet and rich. "Witch Season" is
much broader in scale, incorporating more sounds,
moods and ideas. On the sixth track, "St. John the
seem to be errant sound effects at the
beginning of the song morph into an acoustic guitar line
that interplays with slide guitar and bass perfectly, unexpected but never jarring.

Scenes from a weekend

where pterodactyls, dildos and ring masters ruled. Here's what you might have missed.

Campus Philly Kick-Off attracts thousands
Saturday was a cold, rainy day in
Philadelphia, but thousands of students found
themselves out walking the Ben Franklin
Parkway despite the weather. The event was
Campus Philly's annual Kick-Off, held all day
Saturday along the parkway and around town.
Campus Philly estimated that about 20,000 students visited the Kick-Off.

I was among the groups of Swatties who

piled onto the school buses supplied by the college to go to the Kick-Off, and I didn't think it was
that great. Every ten feet another person tried to

load me with flyers and coupons; I was bombarded from all sides by clashing music from the
booths of radio stations and clubs, each trying to
out-volume the others; and of course there were
the übiquitous political activists exhorting everyone within earshot to REGISTER TO VOTE! A
noble effort, but one that got old after the fifth or
sixth booth.
What made Campus Philly worth the trip was
the free museum admission offered to anyone
with a student I.D. I visited the Franklin Institute
and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The
Franklin Institute was mostly aimed at younger
visitors, but their Giant Heart exhibit was,
according to Mu Yang 'O7 (whom I'd dragged
along for the day), "way better than bio class."
And everyone should pay a visit to the Museum
of Art, no matter how many times you've already
seen Monet and Van Gogh at the Met. Its no
Louvre, but it's worth the trip.

Old Tyme Circus visits Swarthmore
The sun shone radiantly, the sky was
cerulean, and the grass shone a lush green as
kids plodded towards the big top, giving the
scene a fairy-tale ambiance. It was a perfect day
for a circus.
The Old Tyme Circus performed this past
Sunday at 2 and 4:30 p.m., in the outfield of the
College's softball field. "I smell the elephants,
but don't see them," Adam Koontz 'OB said. In
fact there were no elephants, just performing
dogs and the camels, donkeys, and ponies on
hand to give rides to kids.
Danielle Giordano, the daughter of the circus
producer, was selling tickets at the entrance to
the tent. She described the circus' migration
around the Northeast between New Jersey, New
York, and Pennsylvania with their countless
trucks, trailers, and vans to do shows, usually
about 160 a season.
The crowd seemed to enjoy all of the acts,
and the kids were enchanted by the twin fire-jugglers, the rope-swinging performer, and the
dogs' tricks. The crowd laughed and cheered,
and the Old Tyme Circus achieved its goal: We all
felt like kids again.

Sex toy workshop excites student interest
To the untrained eye, the glass figurine sitting
on the table in the Intercultural Center may have
been nothing more than a harmless statuette.
But to the eye with "experience," the long,
tapered object was actually "The Jewel of the
Nile," one the many dildos showcased at the
Sexual Health Counselors' workshop "Sex Toys
for Girls and Boys." Lead by Nick Meyers, who
holds a Masters degree in human sexuality from
NYU, Friday night's discussion/presentation was
as informative as it was explicit.
Meyers, with plenty of help from his visual
aids, guided students through sex toy basics:
what each toy can be used for, its relative price,
safety tips, and any drawbacks. Students
passed around toys he had brought with him;
while many faces showed apprehension, curiosity eventually got the better of them. Meyers also
offered a number of personal testimonials and
stories. The Hitachi Magic Wand, for example,
was (and still is) originally marketed as a "massager," but its popular use as a vibrator caused
a shortage of the device in the mid-90s, leading
to price gouging and six-month backorders. It's
just that good, people.
The Sexual Health Counselors counted the
evening as a success, with a crowd of over 50
students attending the SAC-funded event.

A phoenix raids the pterodactyl hunt
I'd convinced the good folks ofSWILto let me
play in the Hunt as the delicate monarch of the
sky and symbol of eternally renewed youth. But
the plan for me to be a Victoria's Secret catalogue model fell through, so I instead went as
the embodiment of Swarthmore's most flammable campus publication since 1881 the Phoenix.
Surprisingly, many students thought I was
seriously "covering the Hunt" even though my
interviews included questions like "How do you
think the outcome of tonight's Hunt will affect
Kerry's chances in the election?", "Do you find
the portrayal of male pterodactyls attacking
female hunters to be heteronormative?", and
"Have you ever had a sexual fantasy involving
George Clooney?". I learned that the Hunt might
sway Swarthmore toward Bush, heard some
long-winded lectures on what "heteronormative"
actually means that I ignored, and discovered
George Clooney is a bit old for most students. I
shudder at how much false credibility I could
have built up had I not been wearing a ridiculous
costume made out of newspaper.
While in the end my stint as an embedded
war journalist was both less informative and less

humorous than Geraldo Rivera's, nonetheless
my expose will be presented at the first SWIL
meeting after fall break, along with photos of
improprieties involving baby pterodactyls.

Sobering Thoughts

Kentucky. We both
thought that

was a

crock of shit, until
we took a tour of a
horse farm. It was

first, but all of sudden, just as if King
Arthur had unsheathed Excalibur from the stone, the
horse popped the most enormous boner we had ever seen
in our lives. This thing was bigger than Jon's left leg. The
rest of our stay in Lexington was pretty much clouded by
the memory of that four-foot phallus.

There were two things to do before we left Lexington.
First, we had to convince Gentry to blow off his LSAT
prep class and come with us. Of course this hot mama's
boy refused to come with us, wound up getting 174 on his
LSAT, and now has his choice of law schools. We got fat,
drunk and arrested. Who's laughing now, Dave?! The
other thing we had to do was get our hair cut. We had
heard that by cutting off all our hair, and offering it to
the well-hung horse, he would endow us equally.
Unfortunately, this turned out not to be true. We hate
guidebooks. We hit the road with no hair, and our same
old two-foot penises.
We had been driving far about two hours, and Jon was
starting to get bored, when something caught his eye that
nearly made him cry. We were apparently 10 minutes
away from the "home" Kentucky Fried Chicken. We call
it 'home' because it was actually just another typical
KFC, in a typical southern town. Some old dude out front
told us that "dong dang dis ain't de real dong daing home
of kntke' frad chikkun, de olde be dong dang down de
road dang." He had eaten there as a child, and clearly
hadn't stopped since then. Either way, we did get a sweet
picture with the Colonel. We were satisfied, knowing
even Kentucky had more to offer than Maryland.
Next we blared some Allman brothers and headed
south, to the Great Smokey National Park in Tennessee.
We had intended to go camping for a few days, to get in

THE

PHOENIX

touch with our rugged and rustic natural sides. After our
first stop at the ranger station, we decided one day in this
shithole would be enough. Emiliano asked the ranger

audience and getting people to "party more."
Outside the Rotunda will be all the fun of a carnival, with a moon bounce, face-painting, pin-the-tailon-the-donkey, fire-jugglers and clowns on stilts.
Inside, the spectacle doesn't stop: Projectors, wind
machines and light shows will be used to enhance
the fun atmosphere of the performances.
Knowing first hand what the right attitude can do
for an indie rock band, Matt Rubin 'O3, along with Jeff
Anderson of Figurehead Productions, came up with

the Rock N' Roll Carnival. The Perfectionists (who

include Rubin, Aaron Goldman 'O3 and Joel Blecher
'O4) played in the Anderson-produced Thrilladelphia
festival in April, where it became clear that there is a
thriving but under-appreciated Philadelphia community of bands. So the conglomerate of underappreci-

ated but artistically awesome Philadelphia bands
agreed to come together in the spirit of rock n' roll. In
the name of PhiUy's indie rock community, the bands
performed in the Rock N' Roll Carnival for free.
"Musicians should be a family," Rubin said.

where we could find a relatively primitive campsite

where we could camp close to the car (we hadn't planned
on walking on the trip). Unfortunately, the ranger proceeded to list all the places we shouldn't camp, and not
because of bears. Turns out, the most dangerous species
south of the Mason-Dixon Line is the mountain redneck,
a wild, mutated variation of the more common domestic
suburban redneck. As the ranger put it, "The local kids
like to get drunk and mess with the campers." She cited
statistics about the number of murders on the
Appalachian Trail last year, and how many cars had been
broken into across the park in the last week: two hundred and three, to be precise. Knowing this, we headed
for what we were told was the safest campground in the
park. Of course, no journey is without its dangers; we
were attacked by hidden campground fees. Apparently, it
costs 40 bucks to camp in a developed site, and an extra
five if you want to be by the toilet, I mean, river. So we
decided to backpack it.

The rest of our stay in Lexington
was clouded by the memory of that
four-foot phallus.
Now most people take trail mix, lanterns, mess kits
and first aid supplies on a camping adventure. We had
more important, but slightly heavier priorities. We
began our 15-mile hike into the woods with three pounds
of steak, bug spray and a 12-pack of Molson.
Unfortunately, we forgot forks, knives, vegetables,
clothes, soap and toilet paper. Dinner was delicious, but
then it got cold and dark, and Emiliano spent the
evening worrying about hicks and grizzlies lurking in
the bushes. His fears materialized when a Canadian bear
smelled the Molson, and Jon had to wrestle with it.
Turns out that bears are just like human beings: If you
kick them in the junk, they run away screaming like
Gentry. Finally, Jon said, "Drink the beer," and we did,
and we both passed out in the tent. The next morning, we
hiked out of the park, not knowing what awaited us in
the future, but we both knew we were about to embark
on the adventure of a lifetime ...
Jon and Emiliano are seniors. You can reach them at

"Shows have become too
predictable. There's nothing
carnal about them."
Matt Rubin 'O3
Hipsters familiar with the quintessential-yetobscure moments in rock history are sure to draw
parallels between the Rock N' Roll Carnival and
the 1968 Rolling Stones Rock N* Roll Circus. This
carnival of acrobats, fire-breathers and rock n'
rollers featured some of the biggest British bands
of the time, including the Rolling Stones, the Who,
Taj Mahal and Jethro Tull.
OK, so the Perfectionists aren't exactly the
Stones, but they are up-and-comers with heart.
"Shows have become too predictable," Rubin said.
"There's nothing carnal about them." What better
way to change all that than with a carnival?
Where the Rolling Stones recruited the biggest
Brit bands of the era, the Perfectionists have gathered together Philadelphia's best and brightest
indie acts. Cordalene, Capitol Years, This Radiant
Boy, Alphabet Army, Elevator Parade, Pattern is
Movement and Dragon City will all be performing.
"There's always an element of masturbation in
indie rock," Rubin notes, commenting on the pretentious, self-gratifying nature of his music's
genre. The Perfectionists don't want the inherent
snobbery of indie to detract from the fun of live
shows. "People don't always want to watch you
masturbate," Rubin said. "That's why there are
clowns."
After a summer tour and an indie rock festival
the likes of which Philadelphia has never seen, the

Perfectionists have no intention of slowing down.
Playing the Khyber on Oct. 29 with Mike Watt,
front man of the influential underground hardcore
band The Minutemen, the Perfectionists star continues to rise. Go support your former Swarthmore
brethren while they're still humble enough to sign
autographs.

ULTIMATE

Many of us who are used to seeing the words
"Diebold", "SCDC" and "Swarthmore" in national news
publications forget just how quickly and unexpectedly
the issue of the Diebold memos burst onto the campus
scene last year. Luke Smith 'O6 and Nelson Pavlosky 'O6
were just a couple of students with a just-barely-formed
student organization, an advocacy group for an issue,
copyright law in digital media, that few people had ever
even thought about.
The conflict could have ended with the students giving in to Diebold's intimidation, as had already happened at many other schools. Or SCDC could have taken
a back seat to Why War? and followed their initial lead,
treating the issue as a civil disobedience issue. Shuffling
the Diebold memos from user to user while avoiding
legal confrontation most likely would have ended with a
flurry of media attention ending with students paying
large settlements and losing their Internet privileges.
Instead, SCDC came out of Why War?'s shadow and
did something bold
rather than giving in or blindly
defying the law, they came up with a strategy to fight
Diebold in the legal arena. They started networking
with sympathizers from outside the school until they
were able to secure a pro bono legal defense, then set
out to sue Diebold and put the onus on them for abusing the law.
What could have started and ended as a local conflict
between some students and ITS over how to appease
Diebold's lawyers became a national-scale conflict
between SCDC and Diebold itself. Thanks in large part
to SCDC's choice to file a counter-notification and its
decision to publicize it through national organizations
and groups at other schools, the Diebold memos became
one of the hottest topics of that year. Moreover, the focus
SCDC wanted to put on the case, fighting the abusive
expansion of copyright law, became a dominant issue in
the case. Before last year SCDC was the first campus
group to do anything at all with digital copyright law;
now Free Culture Swarthmore is at the center of an

expanding web of campus groups, making digital copyright reform one of the biggest new student movements
taking root in our nation.

What can we learn from SCDC's meteoric career?
First, that what seems like an intractable dilemma, like
the Diebold cease-and-desist letter, can also be an
invaluable opportunity to stand up for your beliefs.
Second, that going in with a strategy and seeking help
when you need it is several times more effective than
blindly giving in or lashing out. And finally, that if
you're true to your convictions and smart about how
you fight for them, you can accomplish more in less
time than you initially dared to hope.

Sharples conflicts may be isolated, personal
Dear Editor:

Upon reading Joe Alberti

'o6's letter
to the editor regarding the mistreat-

ment of staff at Sharpies ("Managers
mistreat Sharpies employees," Sept. 30,
pg. 10), I was rather taken aback. Not
only have I befriended many of the
members of staff in Sharpies during
my two years here at Swarthmore, but
I also engage in conversation with
them on a daily basis. Had my friends

at Sharpies been, with much success,
hiding their unhappiness

from me?

The thought of this made me uneasy so
the first thing I did was head directly to
Sharpies to try to find out the truth.
By the end of my visit, two extremely polar opinions were articulated to
me. One staff member, Anne Dortone,
promptly told me that she felt there
was "no basis" for the opinions

October 7, 2004

expressed in Alberti's column: "I don't
feel abused at a 11... in fact, I think we
are treated more than fairly here." Yet
another staff member, Yvette Johnson,
articulated the exact opposite of what
Dortone expressed. Johnson said that
"a lot of people here aren't happy
because of this kind of behavior," referring to the door-slamming and belittling mentioned in Alberti's letter.
Now, my initial reaction to the enormous disparity in opinions among the
staff was that Sharpies is like any other
working environment: Not everyone
likes each other and not everyone gets
along. Employees often have personal
bones to pick with their bosses and the
fact that these issues exist does not necessarily mean that everyone in the
workplace is unhappy and being treated unfairly. Few workplaces, especially

those where a position hierarchy
exists, are ideal.
So do I think Joe Alberti was wrong
in the opinions he expressed?
Certainly not. If the kind of abuse that
he refers to is in fact going on within
Sharpies, and if the unhappiness that
he speaks of in fact does pervade the
Sharpies dining hall staff, then something does indeed need to be done.
Yet there is also the possibility that
the actions described by Alberti are
simply evidence of personal squabbles
between staff and managers that exist
within every workplace and are eventually resolved. Until more people are
asked their opinions and more facts
about the treatment of Sharpies Dining
staff come out, no accusations should
be made, especially not publicly.

Socially conscious men support feminism

SAC's mandate limited to entertainment

citizens whose lives will b
affected by the outcome of tha

Affairs Committee (SAC).
The debate regarding th

vague nature of SAC's inability
to fund "events which advanc

political ideologies" is a valid
one. The precise intention o
■■MHMiMHHHHi
this clause is unclear, anc
serious consideration should be given to the adoption of a clar
ifying amendment. What the debate ignores, however, is the fa
more precise definition of SAC's mandate that is available on
the Student Council Web site. Specifically, I refer to the line tha
reads, "All SAC events are strictly entertainment." Whether o
not the event promoted a social agenda is legitimately con
testable. A more relevant objection, however, would have con
cerned the debate's entertainment value.
T)rganizer Ethan Ucker 'O7 claimed in last week's Phoenix
("Council overturns debate funding decision", Sept. 30, pg. 4
that SAC "should know that their responsibility is to fund
events that represent the things that are important to the stu
dent body
a political debate is extremely important and
don't think that's unreasonable." Ucker is correct that th
debate was important. Based on SAC's mandate, however
Ucker is totally incorrect that SAC ought to have provided fund
ing for this event. Though the debate could be viewed through
a variety of lenses, very few would classify it as strictly enter
tainment. Even if Ucker hadn't decided to waste this college'
money broadcasting it on Parrish Beach (when thousands o
dollars were recently spent on new large-screen television
around campus), politically aware students would hav
watched out of simple concern for America's political future.
Beyond his misinformed criticism based on SAC's duty to
the community, Ucker stated that he sought SAC fundin
because "the money should come from the student body's rep
resentatives, which is [sic] SAC." It is true that SAC is a repre
sentative group of the student body. SAC's duty, however, is to
represent the student body in allocating funds for a consistent
ly lively social scene. Furthermore, SAC is not the only repre
sentative group of the student body. The Student Budge
Committee is also appointed by Student Council to distribut
money to groups for specific purposes such as this one. Ucke
should have had the foresight at the end of last semester t
request adequate funds for this event. Even without such
foresight, it was well within his ability to request an additiona
allocation from SBC at one of their weekly meetings. With SBC
funds Ucker could have received the "seal of approval" that hj
mistakenly believes SAC support lends to his cause. Even with
out it, would the funding he got from the Lang Center and th
President's Office not be sufficiently "credible"?
Aside from the inappropriateness of Ucker's request, ther
remains an issue of how SAC money was eventually allocatec
to this event. Last week's Phoenix describes three Studen
Council votes, the second one rescinded and repeated, which
resulted in the overruling of SAC's decision not to fund th
event and the awarding of $l5O. While I would like to commen
on the precise details of these events, the most recent Studen
Council meeting minutes available on that group's Web site ar
more than 11 months old. As such, I simply reiterate my belie
that because this event was by no definition "strictly entertain
ment," it should not have received funding. Student Council Co
President Andrew Gisselquist 'O5 is correct in stating that th
presidential debate was "important in general." General impor
tance, however, is not the appropriate factor to weigh in SAC
funding decisions.
Until SAC's mandate is clarified or elaborated upon, SAC
should not fund this kind of event. SAC exists to fund activitie
that distract Swatties from serious academic thought and pro
vide opportunities for socializing and relaxation. A seriou
political debate whose outcome can change the fate of a nation
at war is neither social nor relaxing. Its importance is unques
tionable, but so what? SAC's original decision not to fund thi
broadcast was the correct one. Its mission is to promote simpl
fun, not to cater to the whims of self-righteous campus activists

however, my feminist

teacher taught me gradu-

that feminism is less about hating men and more
about equal rights for women. I also decided not to use
the term "feminazi" when I found out that Rush

Limbaugh had coined it.
Speaking of Rush Limbaugh, I also figured out that
people who spoke out against feminism tended to be
people whose political opinions I really didn't like
people like Jerry Falwell, Ann Coulter, Rick Santorum
and other such self-appointed arbiters of morality.
Eventually, I deduced that this negative correlation
between these hot-air bags' views on feminism and my
views on them was no coincidence. Feminism, I realized, is inextricably bound to several political issues
about which I care, and I usually take the same side on
these issues as do most feminists.
For example, as a liberal, secularist Jew, I believe
firmly in church-state separation as mandated in the
Bill of Rights. Many who do not believe in this principle also object to feminism because feminism rejects

Delicate feminine sensibilities

Dear Editor:

I must admit that even though I do feel strongly
that women deserve the right to an equal footing in
society, I have often given in to the stereotype of
many feminists as an irate, easily offended political
correctness police. However, after having read Devon
Voake 'o6's letter in The Phoenix ("Liking women
means not patronizing them", Sept. 30, pg. 9), I have
seen the error of my ways. Clearly, feminists really

incorrect. Clearly, this man is working to sow the
seeds of misogyny through his "extraneous details"
and his "overly dramatic portrayals". And let's not
forget his "deliberate melodrama". That sexist bastard.
At first, however, I thought it odd that in a longrunning column about Alex's experiences in various
student groups, there had yet to be anyone else who
complained about his coverage. "It's clearly a humor
column," the old me argued. "That's why nobody gave
a crap." However, the new me was on a crusade for
the truth. Reading over his columns for last year, I

Knit-Wits, the student knitting club ("Learning to

Council ("Columnist infiltrates Student Council",
April 22, pg. 9), all with the same use of his insidious
combination of melodrama and details. He even went
so far as to defame SWIL, an organization that tolerates no mockery from anyone ("A SWIL Valentine's
Day", Feb. 19, pg. 12). Moreover, if anyone ought to

before I realized that it wasn't just a coincidence that
nobody cared, but that Alex was systematically working to suppress criticism, most likely by pulling influence with the president of the college or some such.
The old me would have seen a columnist changing
the well-known style of his humor column to avoid
offending the delicate sensibilities of a group of
women as the worst sort of patronizing special treatment, the very sort that feminism should be resisting
in the name of equality. The new, enlightened me
understands now that whatever feminism is about,
it's not equal treatment.

No more silence on genocide
BY MARK HANIS

mhanisl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore College Bulletin states, "The purpose of Swarthmore College is to make its students

more valuable human beings and more useful members of society." So what are the college and the students doing in response to the current world's worst
humanitarian disaster? Nothing, at least not publicly.
While we go about our days being "helped to realize
our fullest intellectual and personal potential combined with a deep sense of ethical and social concern,"
neither the administration, faculty, staff nor students
have shown any significant interest in the genocide in
Darfur, Sudan.
The Sudanese government, using its air force, Arab
"Janjaweed" militias and organized starvation, is
deliberately and systematically killing the Fur,
Masaalit, Zaghawa and other African communities in
Darfur. The most recent figures state that over 50,000
(some even say 250,000) have been killed and over 14
million people have been displaced from their homes.
The systematic rape of women and the murder of
children have been widely reported. Every day over a
thousand die. Both houses of Congress, Colin Powell
and the EU parliament have finally declared the situation as genocide. The presidential candidates even

called it genocide last Thursday night. How can
Swarthmore remain silent, seeing as the college community was active during the civil rights movement,
the anti-Vietnam War protests and the South African
divestment campaign? It can't be due to our ignorance,
not with resources like www.darfurgenocide.org providing comprehensive information on the genocide.
Hopefully, it's not due to our busy schedules.
Perhaps we haven't found any means of action here,
even though professors and students in various disciplines all across the country are writing letters and
raising the political cost of failure to stop the genocide.
With protests going on all over the country, it wouldn't

be hard to organize one at Swarthmore and get the
local media involved. And is the college making sure
none of its billion-dollar-plus endowment or the money
in faculty and staff retirement funds supports the
Sudanese government? Why aren't we donating money
to organizations like MSF, Oxfam or the U.N. ?
There's no excuse for inaction on Sudan. We should
refuse to stand by as most of the world did during the
Armenian genocide, the Holocaust, the Cambodian
genocide and the Rwandan genocide, to name a few. Let
us follow the advice of genocide expert Samantha
Power when she spoke to the graduating class of 2002:
"You have the power, with your sight and your
voices, to cause ripples to flow."

Living wage would not require any cuts
Dear Editor:
Although we are not affiliated
with the Living Wage Campaign,
we attended the tea to discuss
President Al Bloom's proposal
about a living wage at Swarthmore.

We were disturbed and frustrated
by the administration's threats and
evasions with regard to money.
The school has committed to

providing students with adequate
living facilities, or, more recently,
ones luxurious to the point of
absurdity. If we had time or interest, we could watch television programming

on

THE PHOENIX

screens which from

corner to corner measure literally
the height of our mother. The
school has committed to providing

adequate computer technology and
completely replaces scores of computers every couple of years. We
have spectacular new buildings for

classrooms, lectures and living
space, extravagantly built with
stone from Switzerland, ceilings
from Sweden and furniture from
Italy. We know the administration
did not ask us to prioritize these
expenditures, but we hope that they
would also prioritize a wage estimated to be the bare minimum to

meet basic living needs of full-time
employees in Delaware County.
The school raises money in
many creative ways. If our school
committed to providing a living
wage, the burden does not have to
rest on tuition increases or
decreased provision of financial
aid, as Al Bloom repeatedly threatened. Creative fundraising, camand
allocation
of
paigning

resources would be more than sufficient to make a living wage a reality at Swarthmore.

breeds unparalleled, outspoken concern for just about
everything in the world
except for its own institutional future.
If you read these pages last
week, you already know that
Al Bloom has finally released
his "living wage" recommenGARTH
dations to the community
("Bloom
proposes
new
SHELDON-COULSON
benefits," Sept. 30, pg. 3). The
recommendations call for
Sandpaper
new health-care benefits for
low-income staff and their
families, allowing those families with verifiably low combined
incomes to access some or all of their Swarthmore "benefit bank"
as cash salary.
The Living Wage and Democracy Campaign is understandably
unsettled by this proposal. Their plan of choice was a much more
unwieldy beast that would have raised all staff salaries in order
to mitigate the perceived unfairness of raising just the floor. It
also added both child-care and health-care benefits to the mix.
Price tag: $BOO,OOO to $2.1 million per year, compared with Bloom's
sensible $lBO,OOO. (I'll get to why it's sensible in a minute.)
Some of you will remember that I have written against the
"living wage" before, and I don't want to rehash my old thoughts
except very briefly.
First off— and here every economics professor I've consulted
raising wages to living wage campaign levels would
concurs
simply make Swarthmore jobs more attractive. More attractive
jobs are problematic because they lure to campus more highly
skilled workers
workers who could be earning similarly high
salaries elsewhere instead of displacing our current staff. This
problem is known as "overqualification", and Melanie Young, the
chairwoman of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Living Wage, once
said that "there's nothing you can do" about it.
Moreover, a million dollars a year is simply too much money
to consider spending on a goal whose bearing on the college's
mission is debatable at best.
Now, you may buy, as I do not, that the mission of the college
somehow includes deploying its own resources to pursue social
justice directly (as distinct from teaching its students how to do
so). If you do, I would ask you where you draw the line. And I've
already told you why a living wage may not be fair for our
current staff in the long run, but
even forgetting all that
would any of us truly say that there are no better ways to spend
a million dollars a year? Financial aid awards for low-income
families come to mind. So do more Lang-style grants. For a million dollars a year, remember, we employ nearly a tenth of our
full-time faculty. These are goals tied directly to the college's
mission: its students, past, present and future.
But my beef isn't with the living wage campaign this time
around. No, it's with you, the apathetic silent majority of
Swarthmore College. I've spoken with you. I've seen you grumble
at living wage flyers. So I ask you: Is it that you simply don't care
where the college is heading? Or are you afraid to stand up and
pronounce Al Bloom's proposal the most sensible thing for the
afraid, perhaps, of sounding conservative?
college
Believe me, I sympathize. Right now, the only two students
who have fussed loudly in favor of moderation are Randy
Goldstein and I. As much as I respect Randy, I would not touch
most of his opinions with a ten-foot pole. He's a cooties-ridden
conservative, after all, and I shudder at the prospect of appearing
conservative by association.
But it comes down to this: The Board of Managers needs to
hear our voices. Al Bloom's plan deftly avoids the bulk of
overqualification pitfalls by making access to new benefit-bank
cash contingent on a means test. More important, it works within a budget most of us think the college can sustain. As with his
football cuts, Al Bloom has made a tough but smart choice for the

college and its staff.
So unless you buy the question-begging arguments Julia
Smith 'O6 gave you last week ("President's wage proposal unsatisfactory," Sept. 30, pg. 12), it's time to throw yourself behind the
president's proposal. You should do so not only because it's the
best plan for the college, but also because it's high time to cast off
some institutional apathy around here. Silent majority, arise.

War on Muslim names Would a smile and nod kill you?
Over the summer, while campaigning for Barak Obama in a
Chicago parade, I got a variety of
responses to my hero-crushidol's name. One wise constituent, after grabbing three
Obama lollipops for his tyke,
intoned, "You're downright
crazy if you think I'm voting for

Osama."

Yet Chicago-area numbskulls
are not the only ones jumping to
conclusions based on the sound
of a name. Two weeks ago, the
MAYA SCHENWAR artist formerly known as Cat
Stevens was detained on a flight
Swat Meets World from London to D.C. when immigration officers took note of his
current moniker, Yusuf Islam.
Apparently, his name popped up on a list of known terrorist
groups and their followers. Now, Yusuf is barred from the
United States and accused of funding Hamas and associating
with terrorist groups.

Apparently, listening to the wind of your soul and letting
your spirit take you where your heart wants to go won't get
you into the United States these days.
Yusuf Islam is a British citizen. British authorities, including foreign secretary Jack Straw, have expressed frustration
at Islam's detention, arguing that there is absolutely no evidence of a threat or a connection to terrorist groups.

he's a pacifist weirdo. Besides, is a person who very publicly
changed his last name to "Islam" and lives in the spotlight as
a musician and philanthropist likely to be entangled in covert
operations? How does the United States justify such arbitrary
and pointless detention?
It certainly can't be explained wholly in terms of the
PATRIOT Act. A portion of the Act mandates the apprehension of a person who uses his "position of prominence" to
"endorse terrorism or persuade others to support it." The
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) cited this provision
when they detained Yusuf Islam. Interestingly, Islam has done
exactly the opposite: Since Sept. 1L he has used his position of
prominence to speak out against both terrorism and the
United States' response to it. (His Web site, www.yusufislam.org.uk, contains clips of his many public statements on

ago to discuss philanthropy. But I guess when your last

trust you no matter what your resume says.
Thus, th grounds for Islam's detention are hazy at best. His
situation highlights the real predicament ofPATRIOT Act politics right now: Sure, the act itself is scary, but what's scarier
are the arbitrary and racist modes by which it's enacted.
Yusuf is hardly the only Muslim to be detained recently without justification. Progressive Swiss scholar Tariq Ramadan
was scheduled to teach Peace Studies at Notre Dame this fall,
but his visa was revoked under the same provision used to
deport Yusuf Islam. The DHS provided no proof of terrorist
connections in Ramadan's case, either. People like Tariq
Ramadan and (the albeit crazy) Yusuf Islam should be the first
ones allowed on the plane: They're traveling the world and
using their fame to denounce terrorism and promote peace.
In fact, I might go so far as to say that even Muslims who
aren't internationally known peacemakers don't deserve to be
detained or deported from the United States on account of
their "suspicious" names. Five thousand foreign nationals
have been detained since the passage of the PATRIOT Act in

the charges against them are as foggy as those pulled against
Islam and Ramadan, the case against the DHS becomes clear:
We're not talking anti-terrorist, we're talking anti-Muslim.
If the U.S. government is really set on working against terrorism and violence, it's got to stop throwing rocks at the
peace train (not to mention all the other passenger cars minding their own business). A real commitment to peacemaking
and security means developing international alliances, not
building up walls.

A few weeks ago, Etan Cohen 'O7 and Chelsea Ferrell

this campus remain heavily entrenched in an ongoing
battle against courtesy. This is a curious phenomenon;
hopefully some of my field experience can aid in overcoming the social demon known only as "being made to
feel stupid and ashamed when someone decides that it
isn't worth the time to acknowledge you as a person."
As I was walking along the path from Sharpies
towards Tarble, humming to myself and enjoying the
sun's warmth, I saw a little squirrel just hanging out
under a tree. It seemed to be pretty happy, so I watched

roll over. But, just as I was about to reward it with its delicious treat, Mr. Nutters (the squirrel's name) made a horrible squealing noise that I immediately recognized as a

Circus protesters jumped to conclusions
Dear Editor:
I'm writing to address some of
the issues that are rumored to be
circulating about the circus held on
campus grounds last Sunday. Some
people were protesting the college's
supposed "support" of what is traditionally considered a form of insti-

tutionalized animal cruelty ("Fight

circus cruelty," Sept. 30, pg. 10).
First of all, the college sent one email informing the students of the
circus' existence, nearly two weeks
before the event. They then fell
mysteriously silent.
I don't necessarily consider
myself an expert in the realm of circuses/but I do know that they have
been doing some serious shaping
up in the wake of mass animal-cruelty charges in the '9os. This circus
sported no exotic or endangered
animals because, in their own
words, "We believe that these animals should remain in the wild or

in institutions which can properly
care for them."
I got a good look at the pony and
camel rides and watched the animals for signs of illness or abuse.
The two camels were led one at a
time by their trainer and given
treats at intervals. Every half hour

switched mounts; the resting
camel was allowed to graze freely.
While I did not get as good a look at
they

the ponies, they appeared healthy
and alert. Both species were well
fed and well groomed.
The ring acts included both a
variety of reptiles and a group of
trained dogs. The reptiles were carried in one at a time by their handler and displayed only long
enough to draw cheers from the
crowd. There was always an extra
handler standing between the dangerous animals and the spectators.
As for the dogs, the circus was
sure to let us know that they were a

motley collection rescued from ani-

mal shelters and humane societies
around the country and trained for
show biz. They were happy mutts
who knew that they only had a few

specific jobs to do, did them and

were well rewarded every time.
In short, I don't see what the
problem is here. Circuses are close-

ly watched by animal rights organizations, which jump all over them
at the first sign of abuse. This was
the most politically correct circus I
have ever seen, and yet it was fun,

worth my $ll
($l2 with roasted peanuts). I think
that the 200 or so children under
the age of 10 (along with their parents) who saw the show with me
would agree that it was a blast. I
think that our protesters should
seriously examine the issue before
reacting blindly to an outdated
stereotype.

ITS turns e-mail into 'snail mail'
Dear Editor:
ITS has dropped the ball

completely, disastrously
and unforgivably. It does not require witnessing my
paroxysms of rage in McCabe after morning classes to
understand that login times for Swatmail have grown to
maddening and unacceptable proportions. Students,
administrators and professors alike have patiently put
their lives on hold for weeks to give ITS time to mend its
e-mail difficulties. I, for one, have waited long enough.
Deserved or not, ITS is a frequent target for student
contempt and mockery. In the past, I have tried to guard
against unreasonable expectations. I recognize that relatively untrained students fill its ranks, and I respect its
limitations in a small college setting.
A functioning, prompt e-mail system, however, is an
absolute necessity for Swarthmore. It should rank high
on the ITS priority list. Professors,
if not highest
administrators and students depend on speedy access to
their e-mail accounts for efficient communication.
Daytime load times are painfully slow, minute after
minute dribbling away. More often than not, the server
crashes during the middle of the afternoon. Being able

October 7, 2004

to rely on the instantaneous-delivery element of e-mail
is absolutely critical. Otherwise meetings are missed
and work is not received. ITS has created a seeming
anachronism; we're back to relying on "snail mail"
whether we use paper or electronic communication,
right here at a college with a billion-dollar endowment.
ITS needs to fix this problem immediately, or something needs to be fixed about ITS. Not only has ITS failed
to remedy our e-mail, but it has also done a poor job of
explaining what the problems are and how it is going to
fix them. I want to take this opportunity to demand a
public explanation from ITS for its colossal failure. If
acceptable solutions do not present themselves on the
immediate horizon, the college administration must
take action to tackle this pressing problem. ITS has
promised to work on fixing e-mail from yesterday to
today. I hope they succeed. But their performance to
date has been dismal. Whether the issue boils down to
budgetary constraints or to incompetence, I am not
sure. One thing is for certain: The status quo is intolerable.

and administration are extremely cooperative and provide for us what we can't provide for ourselves, such as a liaison with

transportation companies, or wash our jerseys in pin wash."

Red Sox destiny Like butter, they're still on a roll

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

I do not, in any way, mean to offend the city of
Boston, but let me tell you why the Red Sox will fai
this post-season.
I am not from New York. Nor am I from Boston. To
be totally honest, I'm a Braves fan, and I have been for
years. I'm from Maryland. I hate the Yankees, I alway
have and I always will.
None of this changes the fact that the Red Sox wil
fail this post season. Regardless of how high the hope
will be in the city o
how
wel
Boston,
Pedro pitches, how
dominating
Cur
Schilling is, or how
productive
thei
ridiculous offense is
the Red Sox simply
can't win the Work
Series. It just isn't in

the cards.

ALEX RYAN-BOND

Hardball

Assuming they ge
past the Angels in the
first round (which
according to my
Jacol
lodgemate,
Anguiano, won't hap
pen), the Red Sox wil

their old nemesis the
Yankees in the ALCS
and everyone knows the Yanks always step it up in
•the playoffs. Let's not mention the competition from
the National League assuming they make it to th

World Series.

But, I'm beating around the bush. The Red Sox can'
win because it would destroy Boston. Literally.
Why? Because the entire city of Boston, the entir
psyche of northeastern United States, is built upon th
belief that the Red Sox can't win the World Series, anc
that it's always someone else's fault.
1986? Bill Buckner's fault. Last year? Grady Littl
screwed up. 1919? They traded away Babe Ruth. Th
Red Sox are the can't-do-wrong saints of the Northeast
Any screw-up can be attributed to someone else.

The Red Sox can't win because it
would destroy Boston. Literally.
But the real reason Boston can never win the World
Series is because Boston won't allow it. The entire psyche of the city and of Boston fans is one of persecution.
The Yankees are always the oppressors, or someone
else foiled the heroic efforts of a destiny bound team.
Boston fans are so fiercely loyal that they can't tolerate any failure to the point that they don't allow their
teams to succeed. Every failure or every decision is
scrutinized to death.
Even the best plays or performances are always
clouded over by some dismal error or poor decision.
It's pretty telling that the play that defines the Red Sox
is a squirrelly ground ball that a paraplegic five-yearold could have fielded slowly dribbling through somebody's legs and into right field. Nobody remembers the
wins that got the team to that point, just an error by an
aging first baseman.
To be blunt: Boston can't stand a winner.
I honestly believe that if the Red Sox were to win the
World Series, the city of Boston would disappear into a
black hole. The entire culture of the city is built around
the Red Sox choking. Red Sox fans love to hate someone, even if it's someone on their own team. They
wouldn't know what to do if their team actually won
for once. The city would probably just implode on itself
after all the riots.
Every year we hear how Boston is poised to win it
all, and how they have what it takes to finally break
the curse. Every year it's a failure, and I just don't
see how it's going to be different this year, destiny or

not.
That said, Braves versus Yankees, Braves in 6.

The men's soccer team continues its success in conference play
BY TARIQ FISCHER

tfischel@swarthmore.edu

Something big is going on here.
After an exciting 2-0 win against
St. Mary's last night, the men's team
holds a 7-2-1 record. Impressive by
any standards, but unusually so
when considering that Swat equaled
last year's win total within the first
seven games of the season
an 18
game season.
Other statistics help illustrate
Swat's rising prominence. The Tide
has already outscored last season's
-

team with more than half of the schedule left to play.
The men's team attributes its suc-

cess to a new attitude and new goals.
Coach Eric Wagner explained that
"the team steps on the field feeling
like they can beat anybody," a feeling
that dates back to last season's upset

victory against

a nationally-ranked
Johns Hopkins team. Keeper Nate
Shupe 'O5 concurred. "This year we

have gone and will continue to go into
each game with an expectation of success," he said.

Swat is seriously eyeing the con-

ference playoffs, even after dropping a
game at Gettysburg on Sept. 25. With a
3-1 conference record, that goal
appears closer than the guy in the
Spaghetti Bar line who has no sense of
personal space.
All of those accomplishments would
be impressive enough on their own,
but perhaps the most powerful indicator of the team's success is not on the
scoreboard but in the stands. More
than 280 fans attended the Franklin &
Marshall game last Saturday.
Upon his arrival, an excited Taki
Michaelidis 'O5 said "Holy shit, there
are fans here!" Matt Woodbury 'O6
explained that "I could hear the cheer
in my room in Parrish" when Swat
took the lead in the first half. Parrish
is more than a third of a mile from
Clothier Field. .

The crowd went wild again with
about 12 minutes to play as Shupe

smartly threw the ball away as he
was pushed into the net, averting
what would have surely been a
Diplomat goal.
Swat's home crowds average more
than 200 fans per game. Average away

crowds are dwarfed at less than 80. For
non-math majors, those stats translate
into a significant Garnet advantage. "It
is simply more fun to play in front of a
big crowd," Shupe said. Wagner
agreed. "Our guys get pumped up
when there are a lot of spectators
there," he said.
Questions remain despite the team's
success this season. Consistent offensive production has been a problem.
With the offense clicking, Swat shredded Farmingdale and Washington like
a rabid wood chipper through
Firestone radials, scoring 15 goals

through two games. However, the Tide
has scored one goal or less in six other
games this season, relying on a defense
that plays tighter than security at Fort
Knox to keep the wins coming.
Many of the offensive inconsistencies stem from youth in the midfield
and up top.
"So many aspects of the game simply cannot be taught but, rather, must
be attained through experience," Shupe
said. As the younger players develop
into the system, Swarthmore's offensive production should become more
consistent.
With
families
and
friends,
recruits in the stands to watch the
victory against the Diplomats, look
for Swat soccer to continue its rise to
the top.
Let the good times roll.

Women's soccer goes 0-1-1
Practice makes perfect.
We all know the mantra: We've heard it dozens of
times, and it seems to apply to everything, from
studying academics to rehearsing musical performances to playing a sport. The women's soccer team
took that idea and put it into use during their game
last
conference
against
Saturday
opponent

Washington.

The Shorewomen scored two quick goals against
keeper Kristen Traband 'OB within the game's first
seven minutes putting Swarthmore into a hole early
on. It would have been easy for the squad to lose hope,
as Garnet shots could not find the net. Every opportunity was met with a 'clank' as their balls connected
with goal posts many times.
"It was really frustrating because our midfield was
connecting really good passes," second-half goalkeeper
Rachel Jordan 'OB said. "We knew we had to step it up
in the second half."
After a first half of what the women deemed 'prac-

tice' shots, the team came out determined to control the
rest of the game. The Garnet proceeded to outshoot the
Shorewomen 27-10 and broke the goose egg on the scoreboard when Sarah Hobbs 'O6 received a

perfect

cross

from Monica Larimer 'O5 and punched it in for their
first goal.
The entire team felt uplifted after that first tally.
"We were definitely dominating the second half,"
Jordan said. With 8:37 remaining in the game, the
Garnet looked to Danielle Tocchet 'OB to tie the score
after a Washington foul. She scored on the ensuing
penalty kick which sent the game into overtime with a
2-2 score.
The team had the momentum going into overtime,
but could not break the deadlock tie. After two 10minute periods, the game ended in a tie. "We were disappointed because we knew we should have won, but
we also realized we played well," Jordan said after the
match.
Last night the women took on the Bears of Ursinus.
The women fell to the conference foe by the score of 2-1.
The team now stands with a 1-3-1 record in conference play and 3-7-1 overall.
The Garnet's next conference game, against Johns
Hopkins, will likely decide the direction of this season
as the women need to finish in the top five in order to

make playoffs.

Field hockey beats back Blue Jays
BY SONALI SHAHI

sshahil@swarthmore.edu
After a seven-year losing streak, the Garnet field
hockey team defeated Johns Hopkins for its first
conference win of the season.
"We lost three seniors last year and got six...new
freshmen" said co-captain Joanna Hess 'O5. "I think
that what really has made a difference is that we got
a big class of freshmen last year, and after having
played on the team for a year, they're now getting a
lot more playing time. They're a real asset to the

team."
The Garnet made eight offensive attempts and
scored early in the second half. Julia Morrison 'O6

scored the winning goal with 33:44 still remaining.
"The offense was really good about coming back
on defense, recovering back," Chloe Lewis 'O6 said.

The team was more aggressive on Tuesday than
usual. Lewis even took someone out. "I was flying
and I missed the ball at one point and I went

what to call it," she said.
Although the game was scoreless at the half,

Witb Golden, there is no self-glorification. "I like running shorter races. I
get better speed more efficiently," he
said. Nearly half a second behind the
second place finisher, Golden completed the 4K in 12:59.09. "I didn't go out
really hard" he said of his race strategy, "I was just trying to get in front."
When it comes to his teammates, it
is clear that Golden revels in their
accomplishments and speaks of them
highly. "We ran better this weekend,"
Golden said. "Placing second over 21
other teams, we were happy about
that." He added, "Lang ran in the
longer race, the BK, and he didn't finish
but he's getting healthy and that's
going to help usa lot."
As far as conference rival
Dickinson goes, "They're a team we
have a chance to beat. Hopefully we'll

Five Garnet harriers placed in the
top 20, against 21 other teams.
"We were pretty close to [conference
rival] Dickinson. And Lang Reynolds
'O5 wasn't running again so that hurt

us" Adam Hunt 'O6 said. It was the first

meet against some conference teams,
and a sluggish day, but Golden's skillful performance made up for the loss.
"He ran a really smart race, working his way up from the back, and he
almost caught the guy who was sec-

ond," Hunt said.
Golden moved up to fourth place
after the first mile mark until the second mile mark, and then to second
place until the last 200 meters, when a
Dickinson runner shot by on to first.

BY GENEVRA PITTMAN

gpittmal@swarthmore.edu
A rough homestand for the Garnet volleyball team wrapped up on Tuesday night with
a 3-0 loss to Johns Hopkins (26-30, 22-30, 2630). The game came after a 3-0 loss to
Gettysburg Thursday (11-30, 26-30, 24-30) and
a close 3-2 loss to Dickinson on Saturday (3022, 30-15, 17-30, 26-30, 7-15).
"We're just not finishing right now,"
coach Harleigh Leach said. "It's a mental

approach, the mentality to finish." The
team will travel to Massachusetts this
weekend for a chance to improve their finishing in the annual Seven Sisters
Tournament at Wellesley. Swarthmore is
scheduled to play Wellesley and Smith on
Sept. 9. The team will finish the tournament on Sunday and then meet Tufts for a
Monday night match.
Against the Blue Jays, Swarthmore kept
the score close early in the first game, and
neither team opened up a significant lead

until a late run by Johns Hopkins clinched
the game. With the Blue Jays serving up 2625, Swarthmore called a timeout to gather for
the finish.
But Johns Hopkins scored three consec-

and one goal can make or break it."
"The defense was really good about stepping up
to the ball, and playing more offensively to accelerate transition in the midfield" Lewis said. "Most of
[Hopkin's] scoring opportunities were on corners
and they didn't manage to capitalize on them."
As a team, the Tide was fluid. "I think that we've
been subtly progressing in our game play over the
season," Hess said. "We played our best game yet
over Hopkins. It might have been we're used to play-

win, before a kill by Erica George 'O7 ended

both teams played strongly. "I think we were dominating the whole first half," Hess said. "Hopkins is

we could step up our game in the second half."

two more points to give Swarthmore a 6-2

lead. The Garnet continued to lead, and
were up 14-11 before a run by Johns Hopkins
gave the Blue Jays a 15-14 lead. The lead
increased to 23-17 before Swarthmore called

a timeout, and Karen Berk 'OB brought the

team to within 23-20 on her serve. Johns
Hopkins responded by restoring its lead at
26-20, and shortly thereafter closed out the
game at 30-22.

The third game also looked good for the
Garnet early on, as Stephanie Koskowich
'O7 served for an early 5-0 lead. Down 6-2,
however, the Blue Jays went on a run to
take the lead at 8-6. Johns Hopkins maintained a slight lead throughout most of the
game, until Swarthmore tied it up at 19-19.
But Johns Hopkins opened up another
slim lead at 26-23 and then went another run
to 29-24. George fought off a match point on
her serve, but eventually the Blue Jays triumphed 30-26.
George had 12 kills in the match and 16
digs. Emily Conlon 'O6 added 30 assists for
the Garnet. With the loss, the Garnet fell to 612 on the season and 1-6 in the Centennial

Conference.

Despite the loss, none of the players
seemed to be disappointed with the team's
effort or performance. "I thought we played
relatively well," Koskowich said. "They are a
tough team. I think we were missing just
that last little spark or edge."
George agreed with the analysis. "We're
still trying to figure out what we need to do
to win. Something needs to change," she
said. "Hopefully soon."

Anywhere else it
would've been the A's
I give up. I've been an Oakland Athletics fan since I was
four years old, but I just can't take it anymore.
This year, I suffered through 162 games for nothing. One
hundred and sixty two! Think about that for a minute. It's not
like baseball is one of those exciting sports that makes time fly.
I can't even remember what my life was like back when the
baseball season started
I
think I was still in high school.
The A's have been to the playoffs in four of the past five
years and have absolutely
nothing to show for it. They
didn't win a single playoff
series. This year, they just
decided to get an early start on
their traditional late season
choke job.
It all started in 2000, when
the A's took on New York. The
Yankees were simply the better team, and the A's were
lucky to stretch the series to
MATT SCHILLER
five games against the eventual World Series champs. I
Less
was satisfied that the A's
mm^^^^^^^^^^^^^m
would be back and even better
the next year, and they were.
Matched up against the hated Yankees for the second straight
year, Oakland jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five series
before collapsing and losing the last three games. The most
painful moment came in game three as the entire nation
watched Jeremy Giambi (who runs only slightly faster than a
three-toed sloth with two broken legs) round third and try to
beat Derek Jeter's throw home without sliding. Needless to say,
he didn't make it. The A's lost 1-0.
In 2002, Oakland was nice enough to lose the first game of
the series to the Minnesota Twins and only go up 2-L I wasn't
going to get my hopes up. Obviously, they lost game four. In
game five, when the A's trailed 2-1 heading into the ninth, I
resigned myself to another loss. For good measure, the Twins
scored three seemingly meaningless runs in the top of the
ninth to open up a 5-1 lead. Adding insult to injury, Mark
Ellis hit a three-run blast to put the A's within one. But it was
just a tease. Two batters later, the inning ended on a foul popout. Once again, I was devastated. Oakland had just become
the first team in the history of Major League Baseball to lose
the deciding game of a post-season series three years in a

i

I

Cowbell

row.

Last year, the A's were up 2-0 in the series again, this time
against the Red Sox. Some sadistic part of me thought that
the A's actually had a chance to win this time, so I turned on
my TV to watch game three. Things started to come
unhinged in the sixth inning, with the game tied at 1-L Eric
Byrnes, showing his fine baseball acumen, forgot to touch the
plate after a collision at home in which the ball rolled all the
way to the backstop. Two batters later, Miguel Tejada was
headed toward home after an A's hit when he ran into the
opposing third baseman. Had he just run home, had he done
anything other than stopping and throwing his hands up in
protest, the run would have counted. Instead, the A's never
got that second run and lost 3-1 in extra innings. The A's went
on to drop the final two games by one run each. Ouch.
This year, having blown their first place lead, the A's had
to beat Anaheim in two of the last three games. Since the A's
had gotten so good at winning two games in years past, I felt
confident that they wouldn't break my heart for at least
another week or two. They promptly lost the first game 11-0.
Not great, but there were still two games to go. The next day,
the A's led 4-2 going into the eighth inning when things
turned for the worst. The Angels doubled to tie it, and then
singled in the winning run. Typical Oakland A's. I'm feeling
woozy. I think I need to go lie down.
So, next time your team blows a crucial play in a crucial
game, remember: For my team, it's an annual occurrence.
There might be no crying in baseball, but there is crying
when you've spent four hours watching your team lose in
extra innings instead of studying for a midterm. At least if
the A's aren't in the playoffs, they might show up on some of
my exams.

own goal.
In a split second, an athlete can go from a paragon of
physical health to a helpless heap of torn tissue.
Unfortunately, injuries are as much a part of sport as
winning and losing, from the torn ACL of a field hockey player to the sprained shoulder of an Olympic
curler.
Fortunately for Swarthmore's athletes, the Sports

Medicine Center, affectionately called the "training
room", is here to help. Sports Medicine trainers Marie
Mancini and Rob Roche are often in the athletic complex until 10:30 at night, icing down pitchers' arms,
tending to sprains, and taking general care of banged-up

ice attached to various limbs and joints. How much ice?
The training room has an 800-pound capacity ice bin,
enough to hold a grand piano.
However, Sports Medicine's services extend well
beyond ice distribution. A tight relationship with
Swarthmore's Worth Health Center, rare in the
Centennial Conference, enables Mancini to schedule
doctor's appointments,' x-rays, and MRIs. Mancini
explained, "there are very few schools that have the
relationship between their sports medicine and health
centers that we do."
"The hardest part of the job is obviously when kids
come in hurt, but it can also be the most rewarding
when they get back to full health," she continued. The

Center provides full rehabilitation services to all
Swarthmore athletes and even provides transportation
to doctor's appointments when necessary.
The cross country team is notorious for extended ice
baths in the center after practice. Nathan Landy 'O6
tried to explain. "Some of the guys on the team swear by
it, but I never really saw the appeal. I guess it is like an
ice pack for your whole leg?"
Chelsea Ferrel 'O5, a member of the field hockey
team, was more excited about the training room's offerings. "The ice bath is awesome! If you can get over the
initial pain, it has magical healing power."
Matt Fisher 'OB loves what the training room does for
the baseball team. "I had to pitch at practice today, so I
had my arm iced afterwards. Check out how cold it is!"
Indicative of a shifting focus from treatment to prevention, Roche recently installed Princeton's preventive
shoulder exercise program, currently used by baseball
and other upper-torso sports.
The Sports Medicine Center is the brainchild of
Doug Weiss, the head trainer at Swarthmore for more
than 30 years before his recent retirement in 2001 "He
started from scratch in 1968," explained Mancini. "This
section wasn't even open until 1977," she said, gesturing
towards the vast addition to the field house.
The scope of the training room's services is amazing,
considering the small staff, although "things get really
busy between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m.," Mancini said.
However, among the Centennial Conference "I think it
is probably one of the best," she continued.
In an environment where Swarthmore's teams are
rising in prominence, Tide athletes can take heart in
the fact that the Sports Medicine Center is as dedicated
to their health as they are to their sport.
