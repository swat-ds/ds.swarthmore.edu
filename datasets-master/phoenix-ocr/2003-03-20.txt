Sophomore killed in car accident
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
ewrightl@swarthmnore.edu

Friends and teammates remember Katie Stauffer 'O5 as a
genuinely happy person.
She swam sprints for the team here, and she was part of
the Conference championship 200-meter freestyle relay this
year and last year. She was the first sophomore ever to win
the swim team's award for sportsmanship.
She was a pre-med student who intended to be a psychobiology major. She especially enjoyed labs, her roommate and occasional lab partner Natalie Dunphy 'O5 said.
She had a subtle and intelligent sense of humor, friends
said. She enjoyed the jokes on bottles of Snapple and was a
big fan of 'Bos movies, Dunphy said. She was happiest while
she was reading, and it was hard to interrupt her while in
the middle of a novel on the bus to a swim meet.

"I don't think we've really figured out
yet how much we've learned from
Katie."
Swim coach Sue Davis
She was a

good

artist who liked to draw in her sketch-

book. Quiet, reserved, and able to play off her naivete to
make others laugh, she had begun to open up while at

Swarthmore, friends said.
Stauffer died in a car accident along Interstate 95 in southern Georgia early in the morning on March 8. She was traveling to Florida for spring break with Jeff Schneider 'O5 and
Marty Griffith 'O5. Schneider was driving and lost control.
Stauffer, who was not wearing a seat belt, was thrown from the
car, according to Georgia State Trooper MattMoorman.
"The thing I'll always remember about her is her awesome smile," Schneider said. He was Stauffer's date for
Screw last year, and they had been together since then.

"There's a lot of slack to pick up now that she's not here."
"We really miss the personality," teammate Meredith
Leigh 'O4 said. She said Stauffer would giggle with her hands
held to her face. She would clench her fists and growl to
psych herself up, making her teammates smile at her mock
attempts to be intimidating. Leigh remembers the head of
curly hair poking out the "spy" window ofher room in Mertz.
"She was really good about just being silly," Leigh said.
She was not often sad, her roommate said, and apart from
the time she spilled water on her computer, "I never saw her
angry."

"She was not fake. She was a genuinely nice person,"
teammate Krista Gigone 'O4 said. Gigone coached local ele-

mentary school kids for the Swarthmore Swim Club with
Stauffer on Sundays.
Along with Gigone and Leigh, Stauffer became involved
with the Swarthmore Protestant Community. "She always
had something insightful to offer," Leigh said.
Stauffer was reserved and gentle, yet she was a "true
competitor in the pool," Gigone said.
Head swim coach Sue Davis remembers Stauffer as one of
the happiest people she knew, someone who was determined
to go after what she loved to do. "She, was everything you
would want in somebody on your team, both from a coach's
perspective and from a teammate's perspective," she said.
As a swimmer for Swarthmore, Stauffer made lifetime bests
both her years here, and she was part of the championship
team last year. "She was someone you could depend on to go
out there and compete to the fullest every single time," Davis
said, adding that the same drive carried over to other areas
of Stauffer's life as well. "She was a ferocious competitor.
She strived for perfection."
"The way that she handled people was to be kind to
them," Davis, her coach, said. "I don't think we've really figured out yet how much we've learned from Katie."
"She had her act together to the nth degree," Leigh said.
"She was totally responsible and reliable with the coaching
and early morning life-guarding shifts."
"If she found something she was going to do, she would
do it and she would do it right," her roommate Dunphy said.

Krista Gigone For The Phoenix

Katie Stauffer died in a car accident March 8. Her
friends remembered her laughter.
That included her class work, her swimming or a game of
solitaire. She took up pole vaulting for the track team last
spring and picked it up quickly enough to qualify for conferences.
Some said the best way to remember Stauffer
driven,
perfectionistic and eager to make a difference in the world
would be to change the world for her.
A memorial gathering took place on campus Monday
night. In her memory, her parents set up a fund to provide
scholarships for members of the swim team at Quakertown
Community Senior High School. Contributions may be sent

Journalists debate degree of Iraqi threat
BY SUE CHEN

schenl@swarthmore.edu

Two weeks ago, Swarthmore hosted
"The Great Debate" between Mark Danner
and Leon Wieseltier, during which the two
speakers debated whether the United
States should go to war with Iraq.
The March 5 event, "How Should We
Use Our Power? Iraq and the War on
Terror," saw Danner represent the antiwar voice and Wieseltier the pro-war one.
Both described Iraq as a threat to make
their case, but they differed in their interpretations of the degree of threat.
Sharpe,
Moderator Kenneth
a
Swarthmore political science professor,
introduced both speakers as political liberals and asked the audience to judge not the
side the speakers were representing but
the soundness of their arguments. Each
had seven minutes to make an opening, followed by rounds of rebuttals.
Danner, a staff writer at The New
Yorker and journalism professor at UC
Berkeley, began by pointing out that, while
Saddam Hussein does have chemical and
biological weapons, the United States must
weigh the threat he poses with the costs of
going to war.
He warned that the war itself could
bring more damage than Iraq would, making the United States a more visible target
for terrorism. The United States should
only attack when it becomes "absolutely
necessary and absolutely right," Danner

THE PHOENIX

said.

Wieseltier, the literary editor of The
New Republic, reminded the audience that
there is a difference between supporting

the Bush administration's reasons for
going to war and the merits of carrying out
justice.

"I believe that there are international
emergencies that require the international
community to rise up and stop acts ofcriminality and violence against man, woman
and child," Wieseltier said.
genocide and
There are two crimes
use of biological, chemical or nuclear
weapons
that "obligate civilized individuals to rise up" and punish the offender, he
said, and Hussein is guilty of both crimes.
This is why, Wieseltier continued, the
United States needs to go to war.
Danner said that past U.S. foreign policy
has helped arm enemies such as Osama bin
Laden and Hussein. History has also
shown, he pointed out, that democratizing
a Middle Eastern country is a monumental
and expensive task with an uncertain outcome.

Danner warned that the Bush administration is sacrificing U.S. relations with
other countries for this "obsession."
Danner suggested increasing the number
of U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq.
Wieseltier countered that Hussein has
managed to turn inspections into a "scavenger hunt." And while United States policy towards Iraq has been hypocritical, he
said, it is a poor reason for inaction.

"There are worse sins than hypocrisy," he

said. The merits of war should not be
viewed as a popularity contest, he added.
Wieseltier believes that Iraq poses a threat
not only to the United States but to humanity.

The debate closed with questions and
answers from the audience, who brought
up possible effects on the economy and oil
issues.
The event was organized by David
Gelber '63, an executive producer at CBS
News, with the help of Vice President of
College and Community Relations Maurice
Eldridge '6l and Director of News and
Information Tom Krattenmaker.
Gelber had heard Danner debate
Christopher Hitchens at the University of
California at Berkeley on Jan. 28 and
thought it might be a good idea to bring the
debate to the East Coast. When Hitchens
could not attend due to conflicting schedules, Gelber invited Wieseltier, whom he
had met when they both covered the
Bosnian War.
"I thought Swarthmore would be an
ideal venue for a serious discussion of
war/peace issues, a venue where nuanced
argument would prevail over sloganeering," Gelber wrote in an e-mail.
When interviewed, those who attended
said that the debate allowed them to hear
well-articulatedanti-war and pro-war voices. The latter, they said, is difficult to find
at the college.
Sharpe thought it was particularly good

March 20, 2003

that students got to hear the pro-war argument made by a liberal.
"It allows them to see that liberals can
disagree on a issue; this isn't just a simple
right-left issue. The complexities were
brought out more than would otherwise be
the case on this campus," he said.

"It made Wieseltier a lot more credible,"
Cadelba Lomeli-Loibl 'O4 said of his political stance. Lomeli-Loibl was part of the
Stand for Peace group and said the debate
had not changed her views on war.
Nevertheless,
she was struck by
Wieseltier's emphasis that being pro-war
does not necessarily mean supporting
Bush. "I think it touched a chord in the
audience," she said.
Others liked Wieseltier's humor. Even
though Elizabeth Redden 'O5 identified herself as anti-war and said that her views had
not changed, she thought Wieseltier was
the better debater because he was more
spontaneous and dynamic than Danner.
Some said Swarthmore's liberal reputation affected the quality of the debate.
"I think Wieseltier's arguments were
more carefully constructed and coherent,"
Katharine Merow 'O6 said. "I felt Danner
was aware that the majority of
Swarthmore was on his side to begin with,
so he didn't put as much effort into making
a compelling case."
Around 400 people attended the debate,
held at Lang Performing Arts Center,
including about 30 Swarthmore students
who were standing for peace.

Racial slur found carved into table
BY ELIZABETH BUCKNER

ebucknel@swarthmore.edu

A table with the words "nigger table"
carved into it was removed from
Sharpies March 3 after students reported the slur to the dining services staff.
Katie Davenport 'O5, one of the students who reported the carved words,
said that she had just sat down for lunch
when she noticed the phrase carved into
the table and felt compelled to respond.
"I was upset, but I was unsure how to
react. Honestly,.l didn't know the right
response but I felt that I should tell
someone" she said.
Linda McDougall, director of dining

services, stated that, "I was in the
kitchen office when two female students
approached me and said there was a
table in the main dining room with a
racial remark on it."
When McDougall and other members of Sharpies staff investigated, they
found the words "nigger table" carved
into the surface of the table. McDougall
decided it had to be removed.
"At this point, there were people sitting at the table, and the dining hall was
packed. We decided that, as soon as the
table was vacated, we would move it out
of the dining room," McDougall said.
The table was removed from
Sharpies and the graffiti has since been

sanded off.

Darryl Smaw, associate dean of multicultural affairs, expressed his concern
over the incident and said that it reflected current racial tensions in our society.
"It is disturbing. But we have to
remember it is reflective of the issues in
our larger society. Combating intolerance on our campus is an ongoing
process. This reminds us of the work we
need to be doing," he said.
Smaw also said that it was not possible to identify who carved the words or
when it happened. "These kinds of
anonymous acts of intolerance occur
not just on our campus but in other
communities of difference, too."

Holi soaks! It's spring
BY CYNTHIA WU

xwu2@swarthmore.edu

Speakers blasted cheerful Indian music while people
doused each other with colorful water and powder on
Parrish beach last Tuesday afternoon. Deshi was celebrating the coming of spring in style by bringing Holi, a traditional Indian holiday, to Swarthmore.
In India, Holi is held on the day after the full moon in
March to mark the beginning of spring and to celebrate the
fertility of the land. The day ofHoli is one of revelry, with
everyone splashing colored water and gulal, a colored,
scented powder, over the people they love.
The gulal represents the colors of spring flowers.
Though not meant as a dye, the powder can leave bright
colors on white garments and will only disappear after
many washings, according to Devi Ramkissoon 'O6, an

event organizer.

Over the course of two hours, about 15 people decided to
join in the festivities. "I think it went well, although I was
expecting a bigger turnout and was disappointed in that
respect," Ramkissoon said. She said she would probably do
more advertising for the event next year.
"Holi is my favorite holiday of all the Hindu holidays,
mostly because of the closeness that it brings," said
Ramkissoon, "I hope that people had lots of fun but also

understood how other cultures rejoice and express themselves."
"It reminded me of India. It's just really nice that we
live on a campus where you can bring a bit of home here
and people will accept your culture," Anisha Chandra 'O6
said.
Megan Richie 'O6, who is not Hindu and has never celebrated Holi before, was also thrilled with the event.
"I thought I might feel out of place or unwelcome, but in
fact I found it an absolutely delightful, inclusive holiday ...
The colors enlivened the whole scene by both unifying us
and highlighting the gentle variations between us. I couldn't help but feel relaxed and happy, looking around at soaking, smiling people."

The festival of Holi also has many mythological and
religious associations. The name of the holiday supposedly comes from the legend of Prahlad and Holika. Prahlad,
a righteous young prince, was held in a fire by his evil aunt
Holika, who was supposedly invulnerable to burning. He
eventually emerged from the fire unscathed while Holika
burned to death. On the eve of the holiday, people in India
would light big bonfires to commemorate this story.
Holi was celebrated at Swarthmore last year but not
conducted in the traditional manner of Tuesday afternoon,
said Ramkissoon, who hopes to make this festival an annual event.

March 20, 2003

The National Association of Independent Colleges
and Universities reported that the House Budget
Committee is planning to cut funding for student loans
by $9.7 billion during the next 10 years.
The NAICU also predicted that the number of students enrolling in undergraduate institutions, many
from low-income families, would rise 14 percent and
that jobs requiring a college degree would increase by
20 percent over the same period.
The approved budget reduces funding for Perkins
low-interest loans, which keep students from having to
rely only on high-interest loans to pay tuition. It also
eliminates funding for Leveraging Educational
Assistance Partnerships (LEAP) loans, which work
with state governments to provide grants for under-

graduates.

The committee decided not to give increased fundthe Federal Work Study program, which provides money to pay for students' tuition by funding a
large percentage of their wages for on-campus jobs and
off-campus service work.
Bush did increase funding for the Pell Grant, given
to undergraduate students based on their financial
need as determined by the federal government's standard formula. Students do not pay off Pell Grants after
ing to

graduation.
According to the National Center for Public Policy
and Higher Education, from 1992 to 2001, tuition at fouryear public colleges and universities rose faster than
family income in 41 states.
In addition, according to the Advisory Committee
on Student Financial Assistance, financial barriers
prevent 48 percent of college-qualified, low-income
high school grads from attending a four-year college
and 22 percent from attending any college at all within
two years of graduation.

Earthlust, the student environmental group at Swarthmore, collected food waste from students
during mealtimes in Sharpies on
Monday and Tuesday.
Keefe Keeley 'O6, a member of
Earthlust, said that the food was
collected as an attempt to make
students aware of the amount of
unused food that they throw away
every day.
Keeley said that on Monday 270
lbs. of food were collected. "It
wasn't exactly scientific," Keeley
said. "It included chicken bones
and fruit peels."

Earthlust measured the garbage,
unbeknownst to students. This

Police find robbery suspect
BY CYNTHIA WU

A suspect in the Feb. 13 PNC Bank robbery may have been apprehended, according to Swarthmore Police Chief Brian
Craig.

About a week after the robbery in the
Ville, the Delaware State Police arrested a
male near Bear, Del., for committing several robberies. After exchanging information
on this man, the police department thought
he matched the description of the man who
robbed $950 in cash from the PNC Bank. "It
looks pretty good that he's the gentleman
who committed the robbery here," Craig

said.

PAGES l

The police department is working to prepare a photo lineup that will include the
Delaware man. After being approved by the
district attorney's office, the police will
present the photo lineup to the PNC bank
teller for identification of the suspect. Once
he is positively identified, the police will
issue a warrant for his arrest in

Pennsylvania.
If he is named as a suspect in the PNC
bank robbery, the Delaware man will have
to go through the prosecutorial process in
Delaware before being transferred here for
the court hearings. According to Craig, this
process may take a while, as the suspect
will be tried for multiple robberies in

Getting your Rees on: an interview

here are mine and, mostly,
my interviewee's, not those of
this fine newspaper.]
Shortly after September

remained, as a country, in a
situation so absurd and

comic strip "Get Your War

Then, in October 2001,
after we started bombing
Afghanistan, I was updating
my comics and then I had
this feeling of how stupid it
was to keep making these

apolitical cartoons when that

now. So I decided to take the
clip art people and have them

talk about something different. So then it just kind of spiraled out from there.

"Get Your War On" took the style ofRees'
I think there were two kinds of phases of
last two non-political books of comics, "My it taking off. The first one was when the Web

site took off. I think within two weeks of
and "My New Filing Technique Is posting that first strip, the Web site had got-

Unstoppable," using clip art illustrations
with profanity-heavy dialogue (the strips
reprinted here are cleaner than most) to tell
simple stories. The difference was the subject matter. The strips were funny and political, but they spoke very personally and,
yes, unironically, of the anxiety, anger and
absurdity of life in post-9/11 America.
Published on the Internet (all the "Get Your
War On" strips can be found on Rees' web
site, http://www.mnftiu.cc), "Get Your War
On" attained massive online success and
eventually found its way to book form.
Since the strip's beginning in the bombing of Afghanistan, Rees' clip art characters
have endured Enron, the Total Information
Awareness Act, the advancing war on Iraq,
the death of Mr. Rogers, and everything else
we have. I spoke with him the morning
after Bush's ultimatum to Iraq the evening
of the March 17, about the war, his cartoons
and where to go from here.
JG: How would you describe your
comic strip "Get Your War On"?
I would describe it as a satirical diary
using computer clipart.
JG: That's something I was wondering. When you say "diary," do you mean
the views expressed are mostly personal?
I think it depends on the strip. I started
making it for really personal reasons. Some
of the strips just are about how I'm feeling.
I think its use for me 20 years from now will
be like a diary, something I can show my
kids. I don't necessarily literally agree with
everything that's being said by the characters. A lot of it reflects my sensibility.
JG: Let's back up. How did you get
started in making comics?
I had always drawn comics. When I was
a little kid, I used to draw comics by hand.
It was a hobby, I guess. I never took it that
seriously. Then, one summer, I had this
temp job. There was nothing to do, so I just
started making comics using the clip art
that was on the computer. I started making
all these comics about karate. It was something I knew nothing about. But I found all
this great karate clip art, and it really
appealed to me. So that's where my first
book came from. Then I got a new job making a follow-up book. The first one was
called "My New Fighting Technique is
Unstoppable," so the second one, which was
about office people, using office clip art, was
called "My New Filing Technique is
Unstoppable." I started the Web site to pro-

THE PHOENIX

ten about five million hits.

JG: What were your feelings about
that initial surge?
I had mixed feelings about it, frankly. At
first it was stressful, just to know there was
this thing that I had made basically for
myself, and other people were seeing it,
maybe differently than I had intended. It

was kind of a weird feeling. And also, I was
getting hundreds of e-mails from people

telling me very personal things about their
experiences since September 1L So it was
stressful, but looking back on it, I'd say
overall it was positive.
Phase II was the media, when I started
getting calls from newspapers and stuff like
that. And then I just felt it was bizarre. But
you know, I just went along with it. You
know, whatever, I always just kind of took it
day by day. I kind of just decided I'd see

where it took me.
JG: I imagine now that you're obligated to make strips regularly, it must be a
strange position. Like, when something
new and disturbing happens, there must
be a small part of you that thinks, "Hey!
I can make a strip about that!"
Yeah, totally! That was something I had
to think about a lot before I agreed to start
doing it for Rolling Stone. It's kind of a drag,
but now I feel like it's a really honest way
for me to be engaged in the world. I never
used to read the newspaper before Sept. 11,
and now I have to feel obligated to know
what's going on in the world. It's just like
eating your vegetables, I guess. And now
I've just set up this situation where I have to
eat my vegetables. I know there's people logging on to my site now, because Bush's
speech was last night, to see if I have anything up about it. And now I'm just sleeping
in, because I'm depressed.
JG: What would you categorize your
work as? Are you a political cartoonist?

A personal cartoonist? A humorist?
I always kind of chafe at that. I would
prefer satirical cartoonist, I guess. But I'd
have to say, recently, they are kind of political. I'd just say they're like rants. Initially I
think it was kind of vague as to what they
were. Sometimes it was just commenting on
how absurd everything was. The peak of
that was the anthrax stuff. If you didn't
laugh at that, you'd just kind of jump off the
roof of a building or something. The absurdity now is on kind of a much more theoretical level. So that's why the strip, I guess,
now is more political.
JG: What do you see in the future?
How long do you think you'll need to be
making a comic called "Get Your War
On"?
I don't know. I guess when I made the
decision that I would agree to this Rolling
Stone thing, I assumed the contract would
be for a year. Which means I'm committing
myself to continuing this project for another year. Come what may. But, like, am I really going to start following this other war?
The only reason "Get Your War On" worked
is that it just came out ofthe blue. It was just
so organic and felt so good. But now, I've
done it for a while. If I can come up with

something that's funny and addresses how
I'm feeling, then I will continue to do it. But
the only obligation I have is for Rolling
Stone.

Synth-pop with a pedigree sounds
fresh and infectious on 'Give Up'
The result is synth-pop with a pedigree. The combination is nothing short of spectacular for the first nine
minutes and 10 seconds of "Give Up." These contain
the impeccably melodic "The District Sleeps Alone
Tonight," which carefully unfolds from dreamy fragments to unstoppable lite funk, and "Such Great
Heights," a pure pop masterpiece and my favorite
song of the year so far. That the remainder of the
album never quite matches the brilliance of the openers is forgivable and perhaps reassuring. My only concrete complaint is that some of the lyrics are painfulof this ballyhooed electrowhatever revival surfaced, I ly inane. Otherwise, the melodies and arrangements

into profit. In 1989 Forster and
McLennan split to pursue solo careers.
The two reunited in 2000, releasing "The Friends of Rachel
Worth," which actually proved the group had popular friends of
current critics' darlings Sleater Kinney served as
their own
the backing band. Yet this second go for the Go-Betweens had
much more artistic integrity than the oft-ridiculed "reunion
tour" that so many profitable classic rock bands are prone to.
The record's songs had a relaxed feel, as though the duo weren't
worried by the pressure of a career ignored for over a decade.
After all, the Go-Betweens were never concerned with financial
success anyway. Their new release, "Bright Yellow, Bright
Orange," affirms this quite clearly.
Opening track "Caroline and I" starts with hesitant chords,
proceeding to work its way through a comforting melody and a
sunny supporting guitar effect. From the beginning, it's apparent that McLennan and Forster are working on their own
terms. They project a relaxed disposition, calmly letting the
song develop until it reaches a catchy refrain and a series of
vocals by McLennan that hint at a longing for the eponymous
protagonist but nevertheless maintain a sense of detachment.
This is easily the record's most appealing song. Its guitars
sway back and forth, causing the listener's head to do the same
but all of the songs are, at worst, merely likable. "Mrs.
Morgan" and "CrookedLines" suggest the need for the old ironic lighter waving in the air. "Old Mexico" turns an annoying
introductory studio effect into a bouncy rhythm and a rich chorus with layered vocals and the repeated statement, "You were
so excited." Closing song "Unfinished Business" softly sets the
album down at its conclusion with a strumming guitar and a
gently rising chord sequence from the piano.
McLennan and Forster have found their songwriting niche
and are clearly pleased about it. No melody is rushed and no
concept is forced. They guide each song to its destination,
always finding the most suitable songwriting, vocals and production. They even appear to be a more unified front. Like all of
their other albums, McLennan and Forster split the songwriting duties equally and sing lead vocals on all the songs they
write. In fact, the order of the songs are nearly identical on a
track-by-track basis to "The Friends of Rachel Worth," as
McLennan gets the opener, and Forster's songs, more effective
as a cohesive whole, are paired together in the middle.
However, whereas their styles used to be distinct, they're
now nearly indistinguishable. McLennan used to write the
catchiest songs of the record, and he still does. His round, smiling face suggests as much. Forster, on the other hand, wrote
songs that exemplified his smarmy professor looks and shoulder-length hair: slightly more aggressive guitar parts, offbeat
topics and lyrical phrasings that didn't match the meter. It's not
that he's compromised his artistic integrity in his most recent
work but rather that his songs are more enjoyable and that his
intonations, which closely mirror those of McLennan, are a better fit for the band's aesthetic.
Ultimately, it's the nuanced lyrics that complete the album's
confidently relaxed feeling. As the songs gently meander
through their mid-tempo rhythms and reserved percussion, the
lyrics do the same. Forster takes the time to detail, "In her diary
are photographs of some people she's known, stuck with tape to
the page and written beneath are words." The lyrics then go on
to philosophize: "Nothing in my life is numbered; in my life
nothing is planned. You might think you see purpose, when
what you're seeing is a band." These songs are written for the
"easy, greasy Sundays" that McLennan romanticizes during the
song "Mrs. Morgan": laid-back, possibly lazy, but more of a
sense of comfort, reserved confidence and an understanding of
what you do best.

Mud and dynamite: spring break in New Jersey
Tory building were visible in the distance. Again Erik proposed a retreat, and again he was voted down.

BY KATE DUFFY
kduffyl@swarthmore.edu

While many Swarthmore students spent spring break
lounging in Canciin or Malibu, Erik Osheim 'O3 and I
slogged through the wilds of New Jersey, searching for an
abandoned bungalow filled with prosthetic legs.
In Hillsborough Township, a stony manse surrounded
by manmade waterfalls shelters oil drums, glass floors and
a pile of used prosthetics. Weird NJ Magazine suggested
we'd find the limb house somewhere "deep in the woods" of
Zion Mountain, about 90 minutes from Swarthmore.
Though Weird NJ is an exemplary source of unusual

sites, the compilers of that worthy publication rarely
include precise directions. We assumed the woods must
not be very big and headed for the hills without further
thought.

The expedition began auspiciously. After driving through

Zion's back roads for a time, we
noticed a stream leading into the
woods. Perhaps this rivulet would
lead us to the manmade waterfalls!
Spirits high, we parked the car

As Erik and I shuffled into the industrial lot, we noticed
a sign reading, "BLAST AREA: KEEP OFF!" It explained
the mud hills we had scaled moments ago.
Suddenly, a pickup truck pulled up alongside us. A window rolled down, revealing an elderly driver.
"Hey," he called.
"Hi," Erik responded.
"What are you doing?"
"We're hiking."
"Hop in the truck."

Apparently we had just wandered through a dynamite
field owned by the 3M corporation (Post-It manufacturers
extraordinaire). Suspecting we were troublemakers, the
driver's supervisor had told him to intercept us and
deposit us by the road, miles away from where we'd started walking. Though he seemed
sorry to do so, the driver took us to

the opposite side of the mountain
and abandoned us along the highway as bidden.

wilderness. Though brambles and
melting snow proved adversarial,
we kept a fair pace. Hunters had
nailed a plank ladder to a tree; I wriggled my way up and
surveyed the woods from the lofty platform. Though there
were no stone structures in sight, we continued the trek
undaunted.

Three hours later, I no longer felt so optimistic. A hard
rain had, in Erik's words, "crept up on us like the most
fiendish of assassins" and muddied our way. While I
dragged the ruins of my Converse All-Stars through the
muck and fen, Erik stomped briskly ahead in combat
boots.
At this point, the stream we had followed for miles
abruptly ended at a thicket of thorns. Curses! Erik noticed
my dismay and recommended we turn back. I replied by
barreling into the brush. We had to reach the leg house

before dark.
Once we had cleared the briar patch, another obstacle
loomed: an expanse of dirt hills, all at least 30 feet high.
Had we reached a landfill or a construction site? There was
only one way to find out. I followed Erik up the nearest
mound, stumbling over boulders and plodding through the
ankle-deep mire with what little traction my sneakers
could muster. At last we reached the summit and gazed
around. Mud ridges surrounded us on all sides. We flung
ourselves up the next hill. This time some trucks and a fac-

the rain. Each passing vehicle
drenched us with puddle water.
We must have discovered the only
section of New Jersey devoid of
strip malls, convenience stores and pay phones, for there
was nary a Wawa in sight. An attempt to seek shelter in
the lobby of a psychiatric clinic earned us immediate
expulsion.
Hours passed. Night fell. I gave up hope of ever finding
the prosthetic leg house.
In desperation, we walked through a town called
Neshanic, rang random doorbells and explained our plight
to residents, hoping someone could tell us where we were
in relation to Erik's car. Unfortunately, we had forgotten
where we parked it, and any directions we received were
hazy at best.

I fretted over our black garments and the dark hour. It
would be dangerous to continue on foot, but without
money, calling a taxi was out of the question (and girly
besides). Nearly overcome with frustration, I convinced
Erik to convince someone to drive us to the top of Zion
Mountainand help us find the car.
Erik knocked on the nearest door. A man in slippers
opened it. We related our sad story and requested a lift. He
agreed immediately! What good fortune! We piled in his
two-door sedan and thanked him heartily.
"No problem," he said. "This is better than watching
TV."

Erik and I attempted to retrace our way, leading Rich
(for that was our benefactor's name) up and down Zion
Mountain. Eventually, we recognized a dilapidated shack
from our drive, and, before long, we had spotted the car.
Rich refused to accept cash in exchange for his kind
service. Rather, he offered to ask his local friends about
the prosthetic leg house and e-mail us any new information. In my memoirs, I will refer to Rich as the Neshanic
Seraph.
Erik and I waved goodbye and sped gleefully back to
Swarthmore. Once again, we had escaped New Jersey
unscathed!

from honing these skills instead of the var- doesn't feel great, let your partner know.

THE PHOENIX

Too many of us expect our partners to be
mind readers when it comes to sex, even if
we don't have such unrealistic expectations in any other area of our relationship.
Sometimes verbal cues work well, but if
you're not comfortable saying "a little to
the left" or "how about doggy style?" physically guiding your partner can be a more
subtle
but effective signal. Often, she
or he will be able to take things from there.
Another reason some people tend to
resist speaking up for themselves is out of
fear that they will ruin the "mood." Being
caught up in the moment during sex is
wonderful and powerful, but you might
want to expand your verbal sexual repertoire beyond "oohs" and "ahhs." Sometimes
groans of pleasure and annoyance are hard
to distinguish, and I speak as someone who
expected my partners to be able to tell the
difference for years. Unfortunately, this
mistake led to several partners thinking

they were doing much more for me than
they actually were and also to more than
a few faked orgasms on my part. Luckily, I
realized that I was doing a disservice both
to myself and my partner. I began to figure
out what I wanted, then asked for it.
Finally, one of the most innovative ways

March 20, 2003

...

to increase both partner satisfaction and
trust is to share fantasies. Unless you think
your partner might be into it, I would steer
clear, at least initially, of anything involving another person or anything really outrageous and porn-inspired (never will I
understand how certain objects can fit in
certain orifices). Even if you decide not to
act on any of the fantasies you and your
partner share, just the act of involving
each other in your private sexual thoughts
can be fun and intimate. When creating
erotic adventures of your own, work within each other's boundaries and make sure
that you are both comfortable. For exam-

ple, if you think acting out your honey's
fantasy of being the employer of a naughty
secretary with a propensity for spanking

makes you more amused, self-conscious or

nauseated than turned on, then maybe you
can meet him or her in the middle and
work a few phrases into your next session.
Good communication may not be the
first thing that comes to mind when you
think of amazing sex, but just as it is the
single most important part of a strong relationship, so is it integral to a great sex life.

The buildings we all know and love
A guided tour of some of Swarthmore's most familiar edifices and the history of the men whose names they bear
BY ELIZABETH COLLINS

ecollin2@swarthmore.edu
Have you ever roamed Swarthmore some afternoon and
wondered for whom all of the buildings were named? Yeah.
Me, neither. I guess one would assume buildings on campus were just named for rich, white men. After much
research, I have discovered some fascinating new information: The buildings on campus are, in fact, named for
rich, white men.
But that's not necessarily a bad thing.

I begin my daily Swarthmore experience by waking up
in the namesake of one of the founders of Swarthmore
College, Joseph Wharton (1826-1909). According to the
February 1998 edition of Engineering and Mining Journal,
in addition to founding Swarthmore and the Wharton
School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania,
Joseph Wharton started the Bethlehem Steel Corporation,
along with several other metal companies. He was known

In addition to funding for the
buildings that serve as the artistic
centers of Swarthmore life, Lang
founded the "I Have a Dream"
Foundation to assist in the education of underprivileged children.
as the principal force behind the growth of the nickel and
zinc industries of the United States in the second half of
the 19th century.
From my spacious yet cozy portion of Joseph Wharton's
legacy, I head off to Kohlberg Hall for a chai. As far as I
could tell, Jerome Kohlberg '46, the building's namesake,
played no role in the making of what is, quite possibly, the

world's best drink. Kohlberg, who graduated as an economics major and is now a billionaire (not that the former
was necessarily a direct cause of the latter), is a founding
partner of the internationally renowned Kohlberg, Kravis,
Roberts and Co. investment firm. Despite his generous
contributions to the Democratic Party, Kohlberg is a firm

advocate of campaign finance reform and has taken a
strong stance against soft money with his "Campaign for
America" project. Kohlberg is also known for his philanthropy, particularly through the Kohlberg Foundation,
which provides the Philip Evans Scholarship to promising
first-year students.
After the morning pick-me-up, I head to the Mullan
Fitness Center for a workout. The treadmill I'm passing
out on is provided by none other than Jerome Kohlberg.
Kohlberg, according to the June 25, 1998 edition of the
Swarthmore Weekly News, requested that the college
name the fitness center after Michael L. Mullan, a current
physical education instructor. Mullan, in addition to being
a popular physical education teacher at Swarthmore, has
also led the tennis program to several NCAA Division 111
national championships.
From the gym, I return to the Dorm that Joe Built for a
quick shower before walking to class in the Lang
Performing Arts Center. LPAC and the Lang Music
Building were named for Eugene Lang '3B, the New York
businessman and philanthropist. In addition to providing
funding for the buildings that serve as the artistic centers
of Swarthmore life, Lang also began his own college. The
Eugene Lang College, in keeping with the liberal arts tradition of his alma mater, serves as the liberal arts college
of the New School University in New York City. In 1981,
Lang founded the "I Have a Dream" Foundation to assist in
the education of underprivileged children. The foundation
began in a commencement address to a New York public

school sixth-grade class. In the speech, Lang promised to
provide the entire class with full scholarships to college on
the condition that the students remain in school. The
foundation eventually grew to the national status it now
holds. In addition to his philanthropy, Lang founded the
REFAC Corporation, which licenses the products of small
businesses to the world market.
I end my school day with a class in Pearson Hall and a
class in Trotter Hall (OK, now I'm just completely making
up this
schedule). According to a December
1997 Swarthmore College Bulletin, Pearson was
named for Frank C. Pearson '34, a Joseph Wharton
Professor Emeritus of political economy at
Swarthmore. Trotter Hall, known as Science Hall
until its renaming in 1937, was named for Spencer
Trotter (1888-1927), a popular professor of biology and geology who taught at
Swarthmore for 40 years.
Yes, with just a bit of backward-walking training, I'll be
on my way to becoming a tour
guide at Swarthmore College
and now, so will you.

sarcastic teenagers) was a student of rock
'n' roll. And before I thought about a major,
I chose to do a radio show. The WSRN
album reviewers were my tutors.
At the turn of the 1980s, former
Programming Director and current Music
Director John Hammond 'B2 started putting album reviews right on the record.
This practice of scrawling notes across LP
sleeves and pasting typed blurbs onto CD
cases brings the reviewer, the music and
the DJ together. In between research
papers and problem sets, these reviewers
dabbled in rock criticism, building
Swarthmore's own library of rock 'n' roll
scholarship. This elite group ofrock 'n' roll
scholars adds opinions and context to college music and rock 'n' roll.
Reviewers typically use a few words
(such as "wanky wank, dickbag. very compromising" on the Haircut 100 album) or
several paragraphs to describe and contextualize the album, highlighting particular
songs for impressionable DJs. Rock 'n' roll
is rebellion, and Swatties release their
inner critics.
Ever wonder what people thought of
REM when they first came out in 1982? One
reviewer wrote, "This music will not
frighten small children. Their primary
influence is The Cure." In a pen-and-ink
dialogue that would make even Plato
proud, fellow critics respond. One lambastes the reviewer, "You are a moron with
no grasp of reality." Another writes, "Yeah,
and I'm the Pope." A third would be "surprised if REM has heard of the Cure."
Bruce Springsteen's "Darkness on the
Edge of Town" sparked interesting commentary, as well. Below the Boss's photo,
decorated with pen-drawn horns, Swatties
summed up each album cut in a few words.
The song "Badlands" is "Hegelian/Kantian
philosophy." "The Promised Land" makes
one reviewer "want to move to NJ!"
Another claims that the title track is Barry
Manilow's "Mandy" when you play it backwards. (Critics may disagree on whether
"Racing in the Street" is Brace's "most godlike" song.)

to have quite quickly reduced themselves
to a formula, which is too bad 'cause Kurt
Kobain [sic] seemed to have songwriting
potential. This stuff *rocks' but rocking is
as tough as tying your shoelaces." Their
eventual breakthrough "Smells Like Teen
Spirit" earned a rating of "OK."

Not only does the reviewer
feel cuddly, but he or she
can now use the adjective
"strummy" in a sentence.
As a historical reference, the library is
there is a lot of Prince, and

none of the Rolling Stones (sorry, Dad). The
music the station receives in the mail or
purchases directly shapes the collection.
Rachel Block 'O4, former rock director (and
author of several reviews), explains that
"it's really easy to get excited about something that isn't that good, just because it's
better than everything else that's shown up
on your desk in the past two weeks." One
way to cope is the "ambivalent review" for
those obligatory but ultimately sleazy or
over-hyped records, like the Strokes.
Between reading the lukewarm reviews of
Nirvana and the Strokes, you too may
become more critical of popular rock, or at
least more sarcastic, in the process.
Current Rock Director (and author of
several reviews) Drew Adams 'O3 said,
"Rock journalism is always a pretty slippery, self-indulgent slope." This article
may just compound that trend, but, that
aside, what makes a good critic? Acclaimed
and occasionally controversial poet Amiri
Baraka wrote (in response to white critics'
initial dismissal of jazz), "If the music is
worth something now, it must have been
worth something then. Critics are supposed to be people in a position to tell what
is of value and what is not, and, hopefully,
at the time it first appears."
WSRN's critics strive to fulfill their
duty and become immortalized in the
music archives. Jonathan Shainin 'OO, former rock director and continuing legend,

No sure thing
The idea of killing, the idea of being an aggressor
in a war, the idea of invading a country and imposing
a new order on a country are all unappealing and
dangerous. These ideas have been sounding more and
more like an inevitable reality over the last few
months. They finally became one when President
Bush formally gave up on diplomacy yesterday. With
his letter to Congress, Bush activated the October resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq. American
troops, with the aid of Britain and other allied
nations, are attacking Iraq.
We feel very far removed from these crucial decisions and are left with a feeling of distrust. Many of
us wonder if the government has truly exhausted all
diplomatic options and if it is indeed revealing all the
information necessary to assure the public that war
is the only option.
Complete international cooperation would make us
feel much more secure that this regime change
attempt is the right to do and that it would end in

success.

Everyone seems to assume that if we go in, we'll
win, and we'll win quickly. Bush can have his way
restructuring Iraq after the dust settles. There is no
assurance that this will happen, and numerous Iraqi
officials have promised to put up a fight literally to
the death.
Bush has undermined the authority of the agency
that so often has played a crucial role providing aid
after the ravages of war, the United Nations. By steering the United States away from cooperation and
toward its new status as a power that goes it alone in
the world, he is taking away the United Nations' ability to work to prevent war. He has made the Security
Council's deliberations a charade.
Even a president bound by the Constitution to protect his country's security has a responsibility as a
citizen of the world to look to the interests of other
humans besides the 4.6 percent of the world population he was elected to lead.
In all the talk of war to curtail Iraq's ability to
pose a threat to the United States, leaders have downplayed the fact that we are inviting attacks on
Americans by acting as the aggressor. Despite Hans
Blix's statement yesterday that Iraq is unlikely to
strike back at America with chemical or biological
weapons because world opinion would turn against it
more heavily, attacking Iraq does not lessen the present threat of terror attacks.
The administration warned yesterday that
Americans should be prepared to hear about
Americans dying. It is too late in the game to give
this warning, and it seems like some have forgotten
that possibility.
An act of aggression will not help alleviate antiAmerican sentiments, which really seem to be at the
root of the terror attacks with which we are threatened. Bush argues for the importance of disarming
Saddam in order to protect peace, but it is no sure
thing that this goal will prevent terrorist attacks in

the foreseeable future.
We worry that, with the United States so blatantly
opposed to international authority, who would stop us
from committing war crimes, or punish us if we did?
Part of being a free and open country is being vulnerable. It is not our place to strike out of fear.

Bad intentions can bring good results
BY GREG NELSON

gnelsonl@swarthmore.edu
In the closing pages of Ernest
Hemingway's best novel, "For Whom
the Bell Tolls," Robert Jordan, a
young American Spanish professor
who has volunteered to fight fascism
as part of the International Brigades
in the Spanish Civil War, knows he is
going to die. After he dynamites a
bridge, his horse is shot, and Jordan
breaks his leg. The Fascists are coming, and he thinks to himself, "The
world is a fine place and worth the
fighting for." Then he levels his gun
in the direction of the pursuing
Fascist troops, hoping to kill a few
more before they kill him, and the
book ends.
Robert Jordan is an American who
chose to leave his country, join a separate army and fight along side the
Communists. Hemingway's hero in
this novel is not sure if he agrees with
the Communists, but he knows he is
against the Fascists and in favor of a
Spanish republic where the people
would be free.
To me, the war we are entering
seems more analogous to the Spanish
Civil War than it does to any other in
the 20th century. In this analogy, the
International Brigades are the
American military, the Communists
are the American government,
Saddam Hussein's regime is the
Fascists and the Spaniards Jordan
fights for are the Iraqi people. The
war is mishandled politically and

misguided morally, but it is still just.
I am not a Republican or a
Democrat or a conservative or a liberal, but I do believe in taking action to
better the lives of all people everywhere, regardless of their race, creed,
religion or even what country they
are a citizen of. This is why I support
our president in this war. I support
his actions, regardless of what motivates them, because I believe they will
do more good than bad.
I believe that our government has
failed us. It has lied to us by exaggerating the danger Americans are in
from direct attack by Iraq. But the
Iraqi people arid the citizens of the

surrounding countries are in danger.
When Saddam Hussein used biological weapons against his own citizens,
he proved this to be true. A decade
ago, when he invaded Iraq without
cause, he proved it once again. Even if
our government is only fighting for
ego and oil, people will nevertheless
be helped.
The intellectual leadership at
Swarthmore College has also failed
us, because it has failed to present an
objective debate about what amounts
to a matter of life and death for thousands of our fellow human beings.
Instead, they have continued to wage
a battle against the right wing, and, in
doing so, have ignored what really

matters.
Our professors seem to forget that
there are people living in other coun-

tries with laws that would condemn
them to death for even supporting

what they are free to teach here.
Many of them would prefer to try to
prove the right wing wrong than con-

centrate on helping people who are
suffering.
Most people in this country and in
this world long for peace on earth,
even Republicans, believe it or not.

Peace on earth is a beautiful dream
that must never be forgotten, but it
comes with a price. Tragically, that
price must sometimes be paid with
the lives of people who are willing to
fight, and sometimes lay down their
lives, for their country, or, in the case
of this war, another country controlled by an evil dictator. Our soldiers are not murderers as I saw them
depicted on some of the signs at the
anti-war demonstration I attended in
New York City last month; they are
heroes.
If you are opposed to this war
because you think it will only
increase the amount of suffering in
the present, and not decrease it in the
future, I salute your motives; I simply
disagree with your analysis.
But if you are opposed to the war
because the right wing disgusts you,
you should be ashamed of yourself.

The right wing is disgusting, but not
as disgusting as allowing our fellow
human beings to live under tyranny.
I believe history will prove this
war a misguided battle in a fight for
freedom that has lasted for centuries.
I must support the battle because I
support the larger fight. I just hope
both will be over soon.

Ostriches have to confront reality now
BY CARLA GREENBERG

cgreenbl@swarthmore.edu

Saddam Hussein has spent decades idolizing, studying,
and implementing the tactics of Josef Stalin. As vice president of Iraq in 1974, he organized a committee made up
only of himself, his brother-in-law and his deputy, devoted
to the development of "unconventional weapons," which
operated with funds embezzled from the Iran oil industry
and in complete secret even from President Ahmad Hassan
al-Bakr. Throughout the '9os, he refused to allow U.N.
weapons or human rights inspectors to enter Iraq and
remains in violation of many other U.N. resolutions. Most
tellingly, he has continued to show his willingness to use
weapons of mass destruction against Iraqis and foreigners.
If this man isn't a clear and present danger to the United
States, what is?
Saddam has repeatedly demonstrated that he is reckless and brutal and hates everything the United States
stands for. Therefore, he poses a specific, direct threat to
this country. Since the first Gulf War limited his income,
deprived him of his omnipotent image in Iraq (very important to a megalomaniac), and destroyed his vision of an
Arab world united underhis rule, he has been bent on having revenge on the United States, seeking to build or
acquire weapons of mass destruction and encouraging acts
of terrorism, all to that end.
The United States must protect its citizens and their
liberty against the use of force
a serious threat
because of how easily an attack using weapons of mass
destruction can be executed and subsequently covered
up. This might seem like a truism, but it bears repeating:
We have a right to defend ourselves against attack. Why
now? Because it is long past the time when we should
have insisted on Saddam's removal. And now that we
have insisted, we have to follow through on those
demands. In the end, it will cost many fewer lives to take
action now than to let vengeful thugs think that we are a
March 20, 2003

paper tiger.

The United States is a sovereign nation. We do not have
to wait for the permission of the United Nations to defend
ourselves. America is an independent, self-ruled country
that has the right to protect itself from the threat posed by
Iraq. Furthermore, even the members of the United
Nations do not deny the threat Saddam poses, but they
lack the guts to assert their rights to existence.
President Bush has not said all of this directly, but it is
what he should be saying.
The United States (as well as the United Nations) has

given Iraq chance after chance after chance to dismantle
his arsenal. Diplomacy has not worked. There is no other
way to enforce compliance than to threaten to use force
against Iraq and then follow up on the threat. Finally, we
are doing that.
Even besides the danger to America posed by Saddam,
he oppresses, mutilates, rapes and murders "his" people as
well as the citizens of nearby nations. He has committed
crime upon crime upon the Iraqi people, employing torture and using funds intended for the essentials they need
to instead build his military and his arsenal. There can be
no doubt that a regime change overseen by the United
States can do nothing but improve the plight of the Iraqi
people. A dictatorship is not a valid form of government; it
is the means by which a brutal tyrant bleeds the people living in his territory to further his destructive objectives. As
a free, self-governing state, the United States has the right
on principle to overthrow Saddam's dictatorship in order
to liberate the Iraqi people.
We can no longer afford to be ostriches, holding
detached-from-reality ideals at the expense of our long-run
security. We must take our heads out of the sand and confront the truth: Saddam Hussein, and all dictators with the
ability to contribute to the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction, must be removed from power immediately and without equivocation for the safety of our first
priority,

the citizens of the United States.

Evaluate American
sexism before
critizing Afghans

op-art

by

annie

ronan

Women in Afghanistan, under Islamic law, which defines
national law, may not remarry, even if the ex-husbands in question are scum who left their wives with their children and no
social or economic support. If women take second husbands,
they are subject to long-term imprisonment. A Sunday New
York Times article explored the plight of Afghan women, criticizing the nation's inequality (men can and do remarry or practice polygamy), admonishing the Afghan people (women included) who insist that the policy does not harm women; conversely, they say, it protects them. The article, written by an
American woman, had an openly disparaging tone, which was

likely fed by the author's projection: she would not like it if she
were not allowed to remarry, if she

were threatened with incarceration
for doing so. I'm personally in
agreement. I wouldn't like it,
either. It is important, however,
before we, as an American people,

begin throwing rocks at lopsided
Afghan practices, that we examine
our own fragile house.
In the same issue of The Times,
an article explored the plight of
American military women, specifically and most recently those
enrolled in the U.S. Air Force
Academy, who were raped by fellow
cadets. When they attempted to

MORGHAN HOLT

Ruminations

report the incidents, their cries for
help were stifled by threats, dismissals or open ridicule. Upperclass women enrolled at the academy tell prospective female
enrollees not to apply or to expect to be raped if they do. It has
taken 10 years since the first litigation was filed for the inequity
of the American military system to really lodge itself in the public mind. This fact, coupled with the recent move to illegalize
abortion procedures, thereby diminishing American women's
rights to determine what happens to and within their own bodies, stands as a stark illustration of the American government's
position on our nation's females.
In Monday's Times, the business section featured an article
on hardcore rapper Li'l Kim, whose most recently released
album is topping the sales charts to critics' surprise and dismay. Li'l Kim, a talented rap artist whose hard work and dedication have earned her a spot in the limelight as both a musician and producer (with the release of "La Bella Mafia," her new
album, came the announcement of her record label, Queen Bee
Records), is apparently too brash, trashy and ridiculous to be
taken seriously. The article wonders how the woman could possibly be selling so many records. But nobody wonders about
Eminem anymore. And, when they did, they wondered about
him for his profuse, largely satirical violence and intolerance
references. No one wondered about the showing of his skin (or
bare ass during concerts). But Li'l Kim, because she showed up
on the red carpet with one voluptuous breast nearly bared,
because she is outrageous and overtly sexual, is somehow a less
legitimate artist. How's that for equality? And it shouldn't need
to be repeated, but somehow it hasn't yet become abundantly
clear that American women in the workforce, regardless of the
caliber of their performance, still bank well under their male
counterparts. If American women have children and choose to
stay home and take care of them, they are dismissed as insignificant baby factories. If American women have children and opt
to continue following the momentum of their career trajectory,
they are reproved for selfishly choosing their work over their
needy offspring. Far from being men's social equals, American
women, who have been legally voting, legally considered rightful citizens (read, persons) for less than a century, still suffer

incredible social injustices.
So the United States government is biased against its female
citizens, who are also consistently hammered by social catch-22s or blatant double standards, yet we feel our complaints
against the Afghan modus operandi per their females are reasonable because we can objectively state that their practices are
unjust? Our ladies can legally divorce and remarry, but, as with
so many sociopolitical spheres, America hasn't quite made it to
the top of the righteous peak that allows license to lean down
and loudly dictate the actions of others.

Liberal arguments unrealistic
Dear Editor:

The title of Maya Schenwar's latest column
(March 6, pg. 14) aptly summarizes the ridiculousness of her complaint. "Foreigners Face Legal
Hassles," she begins her piece. "Lenient Policies
Lead to Rampant Terrorism," the subtitle might
very well read. It would better serve the liberal
agenda if leftist detractors of the present government reserved their criticisms for the gravely undemocratic methods it has encouraged rather than
launching tirades against laws which protect the
security of the United States at the expense of a few
"hassles."
In her fit of condescending righteousness, it
seems to have escaped Schenwar's attention that a
number of the terrorists apprehended in the past few
months, and still more wanted for international
crimes, did in fact study in American universities.
The Student and Exchange Visitor Information
System (SEVIS) is, of course, prone to error, but who
feels complacent enough in the current state of
affairs to argue that it ought not to err on the side of

caution?
An innocent Muslim student detained by the
authorities is a regrettable consequence of overzealous policing. But one more terrorist using an
American education as a springboard for acts of terror against the civilian population, in the interest of
"cultivating positive relations between the United
States and other countries," is a ludicrously tragic
sacrifice.
One might be more inclined to take Schenwar
seriously if she suggested a less faulty system for
March 20, 2003

ensuring the safety of American higher education.
Instead, she falls into that trap so seldom avoided by
lefties once they climb atop their soapboxes: outright condemnation of every feasible solution in
sight along with the recommendation of an idealistic, impossible alternative. Ah, yes, let's learn how
to "make
or at least keep
friends." I certainly
can't imagine a more admirable basis for U.S. foreign policy than universal goodwill. Surely once
these "racist, unnecessary restrictions" are disposed
of, al-Qaeda will cancel its jihad and the Arab world
will embrace America with open arms and tolerant

hearts.
In the long run, it is vital that the United States
behave less imperialistically overseas in order to
prevent the widespread anti-American sentiment so
prevalent in the Middle East. In the short run, however, while those policies take effect, let's recognize
that threats to American lives are not negated with
the dismantling of a few critical cautionary measures.
Our campuses can only be "a place where people
of all backgrounds and nationalities can come
together, discuss and learn" if it's clear that none of
those people are preparing to blow themselves up in

public places.

By labeling a system "racist" for singling out a
demographic with members harboring violent
hatred against this country, or "unnecessary" for
preemptively dealing with an urgent danger, you
damage your own credibility and persuasiveness in
defending more reasonable views.

Bush's America

bridges

Empty rhetoric and false patriotism riddle U.S. government
War is inevitable. That it hasn't happened yet is more a
matter of external pressures on members of the Bush administration than it is of any patience or prescience on their part.
At this point, I'm not even sure what to write about
the old
arguments for war are about to be discarded. The second the
first bomb drops, it stops mattering why we should or should
not be at war, and it only matters that American soldiers are
in danger, and that we are fighting another nation which may
have the capability to kill large numbers of them (and, potentially, us). However, as is the bane of the pro-war crowd, I'd
like to reflect for a bit on what this push for war will have cre-

ated on the home front.
First, we're living in perhaps the greatest era of "America
first" bigotry since McCarthyism, and I'm not overstating m
case in any way. Anti-war supporters protest policy. Pro-wa
supporters protest anti-war supporters. I can't remember th
last time somebody made a new (or good) argument for wa
with Iraq. However, I have been reading quite a bit about how
terrible anti-war folks are. The patriotically correct have now
decreed from on high that w

Rachel Corrie's death was her own fault. As a mem
ber of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM)
Corrie willingly put herself between an Israeli bull
dozer and the strategic target it sought to raze. While
members of the ISM may dispute the driver's inabili
ty to see Corrie prior to the incident, this objection is
irrelevant in light of the fact that Corrie chose to be in
harm's way. She was so
self-righteous as to believe
that her presence in front
of a vacant Palestinian
home would prevent its

destruction.
The fact of the matter is
that, while the Israeli
Defense Force (IDF) did

rades risk their lives for
the sake of protecting
"innocent" Palestinians,

yet do nothing to protect unquestionably innocent
Israeli civilians from Palestinian suicide bombers?
This question is indicative of the peculiar nature of
"human shield" activism as a whole. If their intentions are to protect innocent civilian life in the presence of injustice, then surely these same people were
using themselves as shields to protect Iraq's ethnic
Kurds from Saddam Hussein's 1988 campaign of
genocide.

Surely these same people act as shields between the
soldiers of Sudan and the Christian and animist civilians whose infrastructure they destroy, men they
slaughter, and women they rape and mutilate. Surely
these same people ride Israeli buses full of schoolchildren to shield them from Palestinian suicide bombers.
Sadly, none of these atrocities have been deemed worthy enough to elicit the protection of human shields.
This discovery becomes further relevant in light of that
THE PHOENIX

fact that these situations all involve the murder of innocent non-Muslims at the hands of Muslim
factions.
This very fact serves to reveal a muted if not obvious agenda on the part of human shields. By exercising their repugnant brand of activism in the
Palestinian territories and Iraq, they have demonstrated a willingness to deter attacks only against
Muslims by non-Muslims. More specifically, they are
only willing to risk their lives to combat what they
view as aggression on the part of Israel and the United
States. It is no coincidence that human shields share a
common hatred of these nations with al-Qaeda and
other Islamic terrorist groups worldwide.
Even if America-hating activists in Iraq acknowl"

edge the racist implementation of their actions, they

fail to realize that their presence will accomplish
nothing and that they will die for nothing, as did
Rachel Corrie. If they believe that the presence of
Americans or Britons among Iraqi civilians will deter
the bombing of certain locations, then the implicit
assumption is that American and British civilians'
lives are worth more than those of the Iraqi civilians
whom they claim to protect. Thus, the least racist
course of action for the United States in its liberation
of Iraq is to make strategic decisions regardless of the
presence of human shields. This will send the message
that the ethnic mix of a civilian population is irrelevant to the precautions taken to avoid unnecessary
casualties within that population. In fact, United
States Central Command chief General Tommy
Franks has already indicated his intention to do just
that.
The concept of a voluntary human shield is selfrighteous, futile and unconditionally racist. Rachel
Corrie should be finishing her senior year at
Evergreen State College. Instead, she killed herself in
an ill-conceived act of stupidity. Though the ISM
blames her death on the IDF, they really have no one
to blame but themselves. Americans should not stop to
mourn the deaths of human shields during the liberation of Iraq. Those who are foolish enough to put
themselves in harm's way should expect to be harmed.

Second, we've turned international "diplomacy" into a
shell game, replete with silly rhetoric, misdirection and the
sneaking suspicion that nobody can ever really win unless the
house lets them. The sheer number of things the Bush White
House has lied about to the world community is appalling,
from the fabricatation of a report about Saddam attempting to
gather uranium from Niger to reports of his nuclear capability. Then then to have the sheer audacity to threaten other
democracies because they listen to their populaces and don't
support your poorly justified warmongering is beyond ridiculous. Other countries don't hate America. They hate George
Bush. George Bush is the one declaring that he stands for
America, whose supporters have decided that everyone who
agrees with them is truly this country, and everyone else is
subhuman scum worthy only of mockery on Fox News broad-

casts.
If you doubt me, look at Sunday's meeting of the so-called
"Coalition of the Willing." It was the United States, Britain
and Some Other Country that's not giving a single man to the
cause. That was apparently the "last chance for diplomacy,"
according to a British official. It's strange how diplomacy
involves only talking to people who agree with you and then
railing about an unspecified ultimatum that you won't reveal
and a war you've told the world virtually nothing about except
that you really want it like you wanted the Red Rider 8.8. Gun
back in grade school. The only nations that have tried diplomacy are the ones Bush doesn't wantto listen to. Strange, that.
We are living in Bush's America. It's a worse place than it
used to be, darker, more fearful and moving strangely out of
touch with the America it claims to so purely be.

Men's lax falls to .500 with loss to Skidmore

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY ERIKA DOYLE
edoylel@swarthmore.edu
The first loss hurts the most. It discourages, bursts your confidence and
tames your flair. Nevertheless, with every
loss you experience, you learn something.

This proved especially true for the Garnet
last week over break as they took an
intense game from Goucher and a valuable lesson from their loss against
Skidmore. From this point, the squad
heads into a consistently packed schedule
of Wednesday and Saturday games for the
rest of their season, taking their wins and
losses in stride.
While other Swatties were tanning on
the beaches of California or relaxing in
exotic spring break getaways like Mexico,

the Garnet men spent the week sweating
through long practices in preparation for
the game against Skidmore College.
Despite this preparation, Clothier Field

was the site for the Garnet's first loss on
their home turf as they fell 14-7 to
Skidmore this past Saturday. Chris

Bivona quickly paved the road to victory
for the Thoroughbred offense, scoring
three goals in the first three minutes. His
teammate Andy Meehan picked it up the
rest of the game with five goals and two
assists, denying Swarthmore the chance

for a comeback.
After the three-goal deficit, Swat's
sophomore attacker Tim Chryssikos 'O5
scored a goal only to see Skidmore
respond with four more to take a first
quarter lead of 7-L Swarthmore closed the
gap to 8-3 by halftime with goals by attack
Patrick Friel 'O3, assisted by attack Joe
DeSimone 'O4 and Chryssikos. At the start
of the second half, Friel scored a quick
goal, bringing the score to 8-4, but again
the Thoroughbreds raced away, outscoring the Garnet 6-1 until the final minute.

In the last minute of play, Friel, assisted
by Chryssikos and DeSimone, tallied a
goal to put the score at 14-7.
The squad views this loss as resulting,
in part, from Skidmore's quick offense at
the start. Consequently, their fast-scoring
runs proved too great to allow any recovery. "They came out running an offense
that we weren't expecting and scored several goals early," said Nathaniel Court 'O3.
Moreover, Swat's slow start in response
eventually cost them the game, as the
quick scoring paralyzed the Garnet's
defense too early in the day. "We came
back and played an even game after the
first 10 minutes, but the first quarter left
us with too much of a deficit," Court said.
In a moment of reflection, the squad puts
this loss into long-term perspective. "The
Skidmore game was a disappointing loss,
but we understand that more important
than losing is how you recover from those
losses." They intend to learn from their
weaknesses in this game and move forward
with eagerness. "We must maintain the
attitude and determination we built in preseason as we head into conference play," cocaptain John Murphy 'O3 said.
Earlier in the week, on March 8, the
Garnet aggressively battled to glory
against Goucher, defeating them 5-4 in the
second overtime. Middie John Murphy
cashed in the game-winning goal with 1:44
remaining in the second overtime.
Goucher (1-2) lost an early lead but were
able to tie the game back up in the fourth
period only to have the Garnet knock
Miriam Perez Phoenix Staff
them off their feet in overtime.
The Garnet Tide fell to fourth-ranked conference foe Gettysburg 8-4 yesterday at home.
The Goucher victory occurred at a crucial time, according to Court. "That was a
huge win. Goucher has always been a good es at this moment in their season. The
the season, and the job now becomes one
competitor, and that game showed us that squad had its first conference game of preparing for specific opponents and

"From here on, we have games every

Japanese teams make sashimi out of Garnet Tsunami
BY FRANK VISCIANO

fviscial@swarthmore.edu

111-equipped with little more than a meager vocabulary
of konichi wa and oregato gozaimasu, the Swarthmore
men's tennis team boarded a plane (not a private jet, contrary to popular belief) and made the long journey to
Japan for a little tenisu this spring break. With tennis as
our immediate focus, few of us took the time to consider
the experience we had in store. After arriving in Tokyo,

the Garnet Tsunami had scarcely enough time to shake off
the jet lag before squaring up against Waseda University,
the country's top-ranked collegiate team. Sporting several
players with rankings on the professional tennis circuit,
Waseda made short work of Swarthmore. On courts combining the joys of both Astroturf and sand, and in spite of
tsunami-strength winds, Waseda skillfully made sashimi
of a strong Swarthmore team. While their agility on a
tough surface was impressive, perhaps more remarkable
was the grace with which they transitioned from opponent
to generous host to quick friends immediately following
the match. From Waseda, Swarthmore took its first loss of
the trip as well as its first taste of Japanese hospitality
(and sushi).
But, as the saying goes, there was no rest for the jetlagged. On the second day of the trip, Swarthmore met
Keio University, a school known as much for serious aca-

demics as serious tennis. Despite solid play all around and
a hard-fought win by first-year sensation Jack Rodd 'O6,
the Garnet succumbed to winds, sand and a tough Keio
team. After Keio's warm reception, we thought, if nothing
else, that we owed it to them to show them a great night.
And thus began a cultural exchange of the finest order.
While Japan graciously gave us a tennis lesson or two,
Swarthmore more than reciprocated by illustrating the
cultural blend ofAmerica through our time-honored tradition of sake bombing. A second loss, but a terrific time had

byaU.
Following a spectacular day of sightseeing (read: wandering aimlessly around Tokyo), Swarthmore prepared for
what would prove to be its deepest cultural immersion
(read: painful challenge) thus far against the Howler
Monkeys of Gakushuin University. Now, I may be basing
my assertions on an incomplete knowledge of the most
recent census, but I am fairly sure that approximately 79.4
percent of Tokyo turned out for the match and was on the
court to root (read: scream until our ears bled) for the
Japanese players. In the end, their unbridled enthusiasm
was enough to barely overcome victories at second and
third doubles and singles wins by Rodd, Ben Rae 'O4 and
Aaron Rubin 'O4. Yet again, a cultural exchange ensued.
Swarthmore received an altered perception of the term
"spectator sport," and Gakushuin was taught how to tear
up a stage, Tokyo karaoke-style.

In the final match against the Kansai Regional All-Star
team, the Swarthmore men were so excited to see traditional hard tennis courts that they failed to focus on the
"all-star" portion of their opponent's title. Although the
Garnet played by far their strongest match, Japan once
again prevailed.
Although we spent roughly 68.2 percent of our time lost
and 15.3 percent of our time on the ground after falling on
those beautifully sandy Japanese tennis courts, the
remainder of our trip was an unbelievably memorable cultural and educational experience. Thanks in large part to
the mystical disappearances and Zen-like simplicity in the
coaching, style of the fantastically flexible head coach and
sensei Mike Mullan, the Garnet Tide learned a great deal
from their time in Japan:

Japan provides stiff competition
BY DERRICK WU

dwul@swarthmore.edu

Although the women's and men's tennis teams finished a combined 0-6 over
spring break, don't let the teams' early
results deceive you. Both squads faced
topflight competition and expect to win
many of their upcoming matches against
Division 111 opponents.
The men's team traveled to Japan and
lost to Waseda University 7-0, Keio
University 6-1, Gakushuin University 4-3
and to the Kansai Regional All Stars 6-L
The
Garnet
fared best against
Gakushuin, with singles victories by
Ben Rae 'O4 and Zac Rodd 'O5 and in
three of the four doubles matches.
The women's team traveled

to
Virginia and lost to two nationally
ranked Division 111 opponents, secondranked Washington and Lee (W&L) 8-1
and 12th-ranked Denison 7-2. The duo of
Megan Speares 'O5 and Elli Suzuki 'O6 at
third doubles picked up the lone point
against W&L, defeating their opponents
8-2. In the match against Denison,
Kristina Pao 'O4 won 7-5, 7-6 (5) at second
singles and Caroline Celano 'O5 won 6-4,
6-4 at third singles.
The matches against the top teams in

the country gave the Garnet women an
honest assessment of the team's ability.
"Overall, it was a great spring break.
The two teams we played were both
nationally ranked teams, and it gave us
a chance to see where we have made
progress and where progress was still
needed to be made," Pao said.

Although the Garnet dropped both
matches over break, women's head
coach Jeremy Loomis is optimistic
about the team's future. "We're not in
the same league as W&L but are coming
closer to beating teams in the top 15 in
the country," Loomis said. "I think we
were in all of the matches and when we
have another chance, I'm sure we'll capitalize."
While the men's team does not compete in the Centennial Conference, the
women's team is hoping to regain the
top spot in the conference behind the
seasoned leadership of Pao and top seeded Anjani Reddy 'O4. The team last won
the championship in 2001, when Pao,
Reddy and Celano were first-years.

Softball preps in Ariz., looks ahead to Widener
Squad records 1-6 mark against Div. I and Div. II competition over break
BY EMILY CONLON
econlonl@swarthmore.edu
As Swarthmore students scattered across the globe for
spring break, the women's softball team claimed the
southwest corner of the country for seven days of training. Donning gloves, helmets and T-shirts, the women
combined training sessions with exhibition games to
improve their skills in Arizona.
Many of the team members have been familiar faces
around Lamb-Miller Field House this winter. Throughout
their winter training, they've honed their batting and polished their catching in preparation for the season ahead.
"The team as a whole worked really hard during the
winter months preparing for the spring season," Kristie
LaSalle 'O6 said of the team's dedication to the sport.
"Coach Kline has been actively recruiting the last few
years since he joined the program and has managed to
pull together a group of girls with a great team dynamic."
Lindsay VanSciver 'O3 echoed LaSalle's observations.
"We've really taken advantage of building a team this
winter," she said. "We've spent so many hours in the field
house working out and practicing, it will be great to see
things come together for us once we get outdoors."
The group traveled to Arizona on March 8 to take
advantage of the weather and facilities. During their stay,

.

the women competed against seven Division I and Div. II
teams. Returning shortstop Pam Lavallee 'O3 said, "We
went down there with a lot of confidence and excitement.
Although the team was a little apprehensive about playing outdoors for the first time, most of the other teams we
played were in the same boat."
The Garnet's preseason record of 1-6 does not accurately reflect how well they played. "Our main problem
was that, in each game, we would have one bad inning
that would put us in a hole," Lavallee said. "If we can
work on maintaining our composure and fix our errors,

we will do fine."
VanSciver added that the team had "struggled a little
at crucial points during some of the games." With time,
though, she said she thought it would overcome "the
mental obstacles."
Because the team did not graduate any seniors from
last year, experience does not appear to be a hurdle for
the 2003 team. These returning players, in combination
with a talented class of first-years, have produced the
most successful preseason that any player can remember.
"Even the technical problems that we face now, like making contact with the ball, seem to be less of a problem
than in past years. We've got a lot potential and if we can
consistently improve, we might just surprise everyone,"
Lavallee said.

Track opens outdoor
season at FSU Invite
Gardner nabs second in 1500-meter;
Golden takes sixth in 5000-meter
BY JIM DALTON
jdaltonl@swarthmore.edu

The Garnet outdoor track and field
teams opened up the outdoor season by
traveling south to the warm, sunny conditions of Tallahassee, Fla., to participate in
the competitive Snowbird Invitational at
Florida State University's newly renovated Mike Long Track. Matched with 23
other teams, most of which were of
Division I caliber, the Garnet's core of talented harriers were put to the test, gaining valuable experience against the elite

competition.
For the men's side, James Golden 'O5
paced the Tide with a sixth place showing
in the 5000-meter run at 15:23.31 Matt
Williams 'O4 raced to a 13th place finish in
the 110-meter hurdles with a time of 16.10
seconds, while finishing in 14th place in
the 400-meter hurdles at 59.46 seconds.
"The meet was productive because it
gave us a chance to run against some
Division I competition and provided a
starting point for our times on the outdoor
track," the hurdler Williams said. "For
me, the hurdles were interesting because
both my hurdle races were longer. For
example, instead of running the 55 hurdles, I ran the 110 hurdles. This resulted in
my legs being pretty confused when I kept
on going past the fifth hurdle, ultimately
resulting in clipping one or two. But that

will pass with a few more weeks of run-

ning them."
Tyler Lyson 'O6 finished in 29th place in
the 200-meter dash at 25.08 seconds. Lang
Reynolds 'O5 and Keefe Keeley 'O6, racing

18

for the first time since the fall, finished in
19th and 23rd places in the 1500-meter run
with times of 4:19.06 and 4:30.71 respectively. Reynolds also finished in 27th place at
2:10.52, while Keeley finished in 28th place
at 2:12.15 in the 800-meter run. Competing
in the 3000-meter steeplechase for the first
time, Adam Hunt 'O6 finished 12th with a
time of 11:0149.
Flirting with the school's 1500-meter
outdoor record, Elizabeth Gardner 'O5
cruised to a second-place finish with a
speedy time of 4:44.51. First-year harriers
Emily Wistar 'O6 and Lauren Fety 'O6 followed with 27th and 28th place finishes, at
5:15.46 and 5:20.07 respectively. Fety paced
Swarthmore in the 800-meter run with an
18th place finish at 2:34.41
Jessica Zagory 'O5 leaped to an 18thplace finish in the long jump with a jump
of 4.34 meters. Sarah Hobbs 'O6 finished
18th in the 5000-meter run with a time of
19:53.03. The women's 4x400-meter relay
team, consisting of harriers Gardner,
Wistar, Claire Hoverman 'O3, and Njideka
Akunyili 'O4, placed seventh with a time of
4:12.32.

The season outlook is definitely optimistic for the surging Tide, due in part to
the success of the indoor team and the
return of key athletes from injury. "There
are many guys and girls who are coming
back from injuries, and they will help our
team a lot," Golden said. "On the guys'
side, we may have enough depth to place
second to last at conferences, which would
be great. But just in case we get last again,
at least we have an excuse this time
there isn't a track for us to practice on."

Leading the team through the mental and physical rigors of the sport are returning seniors Katy O'Donnell,
VanSciver, Felicia Carter 'O3 and Lavallee. Veteran Mary
Mintel 'O5 will also be a key player for success this year.
"Mary is a wonderful example to any college athlete playing any sport. Her hard work and her hustle on the field
and at practice never cease to amaze me," LaSalle said.
The team will immediately look to its new players for
support, as three members of the class of 'O6 are starting
infielders, one is a pitcher and one is an outfielder. The
pitcher, Emily Remus 'O6, recorded the team's first win

over break.
"Overall, we're ready for a really strong conference
season," LaSalle said. Lavallee agreed that, "while we
haven't had the most success in the past couple of years,
this year's team seems to be up to the challenge. We are
going to scare some teams this season."
This week, the Garnet look to avenge last year's loss to
Widener. While the beautiful weather is not even close to
the temperatures of Arizona, the team looks forward to
playing outside. "The biggest part of preparing for the
game would have to be just being ready to play outside in
colder weather than we experienced in Arizona," LaSalle
said, "but I think we will be fine." Rain or shine, the
women will take the field in hopes of securing their first
East Coast win Tuesday at 4 p.m.

Garnet close season
with loss in ECAC finals
Senior Ali Furman and junior Katie
Robinson contribute 19 points apiece
KATE NELSON-LEE

knelson2@swarthmore.edu

It's not often that a senior can be completely satisfied with her athletic career.
Co-captain Ali Furman 'O3 wrapped up her final season leading the women's basketball team with 19 points in a close 71-66 loss to Lebanon Valley in the ECAC
Southern Region finals last Sunday. Add that to four 20-plus win seasons, the
school's career three-point record, the three-season three-point records, a trip to
the NCAAs, an ECAC finals game and a Seven Sisters title, and there isn't much
Furman hasn't been a part of here at Swarthmore.
"I've been really lucky," the guard said. "I've gotten to do everything a
Division 111 player could ever hope to do in their career."
The team's trip through the ECAC Southern tourney started with a 68-58 romp
over visiting Alvernia three weeks ago. The win propelled the women into a semifinal matchup against number one seed and host Moravian. Leading 29-21 at halftime, the team pulled out a dominating 67-54 win behind five treys and 16 points
from Furman. Co-captain forward Katie Robinson 'O4 led all scorers with 21 points
and 10 rebounds, her second consecutive double-double of the tournament.
"It was a great game," Furman said. "Moravian was really hyped up. They
were the number one seed and from the MAC conference, which is considered the
best conference in our region. The win was a big deal for us and for the Centennial
Conference."
The Garnet faced powerhouse Lebanon Valley in the finals the next day.
Outmatched at the post position, the team struggled early, trailing 34-29 at the
half. After getting into early foul trouble, the tired Garnet got down by as many
as 15 in the second half before turning up the pressure and battling back within
three with 15 seconds left. Some questionable missed calls in Leb Valley's favor
sealed out the Garnet, who lost by a slim 71-66 margin. Both Furman and Robinson
contributed 19 points apiece for the Garnet as the team shot 30.8 percent.
"It was a game that could have gone either way," head coach Adrienne Shibles
said. "The women battled hard. Everyone left their heart on the court, and I was
happy with the game."
Shibles had nothing but praise for her young team's success this season. "I was
expecting a *rebuilding year,' but from the very first I was impressed with the attitude the team brought to the court. They made the year so much fun."
The Garnetawait news of more individual postseason accolades and are happy
with their 21-8 (12-3 CC) record.

Warmothers take first at First Wave; Earthworms place third
BY DERRICK WU
dwul@swarthmore.edu

The women's ultimate team may have
increased its chances for a nationals bid

by winning the First Wave tournament
held in Savannah, Ga., on March 8-9.
Playing with a mix of experienced veterans and talented first-years, the perennially powerful Warmothers placed first out
of six teams, finishing the tournament
with an unblemished 7-0 record. The 13member squad that traveled south for
spring break played five games back-toback on Saturday, culminating in a satisagainst

University
of North Carolina at
Wilmington (UNCW), a notoriously meanspirited team. According to several
Swarthmore team members, the UNCW
coach disrupted the game with rude comments, and the players committed a string
of unnecessary hard fouls. "They lived up
to their reputation," Alyssa Bell 'O3 said.
Despite the string of games and the

nasty temperament of their opponent, the
Warmothers prevailed in a game of attrition. "Our spirit triumphed in that game,"
Bell said.
While the win was a group effort, the

scoring prowess of sisters Carolynn
Laurenza 'O3, one of the team's tri-captains, and Marie Laurenza 'O6, a newcomer with great upside, helped power the
team to victory. "Carolynn and Marie had
some amazing grabs in the end zone, with
Carolynn skying above her defenders and
Marie burning defenders in the dust with
her speed," Bell said.
If five games in one day had taken
their toll on the Warmothers, it did not
show in the playoff matches the following
day. The team easily defeated the
University of Rochester 15-8 in the semifinal match and University of Virginia in
the final match 15-11. "The win against
UVA was pretty exciting, because they
had some tricky plays on offense and
defense that we hadn't tackled before. We
were able to rise to a new level of play,"

Bell said.
Overall, the team was proud of its play
and impeccable record at the tournament.
"We were taken off guard by the number
of games we had to play, but it was exciting to do so well," Genevieve de Messieres
'O4 said.
After the First Wave tournament, the

team spent the week practicing hard at a
school field near its beach house in
South Carolina. The difficult practices
particularly benefited the newer players,
who were able to work on improving
techniques and strategies. "I felt like I

Messieres 'O4 said.
Although the intense practices will
undoubtedly help the team in the long
run, they may have affected the team's
play at the highly regarded Terminus
tournament, held last weekend in Atlanta.
Disappointingly, the Warmothers placed
13th out of 24 teams. "A few of the more
experienced players were injured after
the First Wave tournament and a week of
hard practicing," Carolynn Laurenza
explained.

The team is certainly focused on improving upon last season's performance, when it
struggled early in the year but strung together some quality wins late in the season, including a sweep of Gettysburg. To do that, though, the Garnet will need to fill the holes left by
Scott Kushner 'O2, who earned all-conference honors last season, and Joe Corso 'O2, who
paced the team from behind the plate for several seasons. "Losing Kushner and Corso was
significant," Goldstein said. "They were both big contributors on the field of play, and more
importantly, as team leaders and veterans, they brought a lot to the table. That being said,
we've got some solid freshman." Mike Peiropan 'O6 has stepped in at second base for Billy

Perennial slugger Ryan Pannorfi 'O4 moved into left field from third because, Goldstein
said, "he's got some back injuries that have been plaguing him for the past couple of years,
and playing third has been real hard on his back." King remains at center and Sconce at
third, with Goldstein grabbing much of the time at right field.
In terms of the season's goals, the squad is hoping to change its losing ways when it
enters Centennial Conference play next week, Goldstein said. "We're definitely looking to
get into the playoffs as one of the top four teams," he added.
Swarthmore hosted Neumann yesterday afternoon and, after a weekend off, will travel to

This is not to say that you cannot prepare to do better
than the next person. There are some general rules that one
can follow. They do not always hold true, but, more often
than not, they can keep you in the money for the big bills.
First, know that there will be upsets. Indubitably, some
low-seeded team makes a Cinderella run deep in the tournament. The key is to find one of these teams you like when
filling in the bracket. Recent history shows that a 12 seed
will beat a five. The 13 versus four-seed matchup is another
personal favorite. In general, look for a talented, underrated
mid-major school in these games to beat a middle-of-thepack team from a power conference. My squad this year is
13-seed Tulsa, whom I like to beat Dayton and Marquette
before exiting.

My reason for choosing Tulsa leads to another general
rule: Pick teams that emphasize good guard play. Tulsa is
loaded with quick, experienced guards who can play defense
and knock down the jumper. The tournament will be decided by guard play. One need only refer to last year's champion, Maryland, which featured star two guard Juan Dixon, a
very good point guard in Steve Blake and a deadly shooter

off the bench in Drew Nicholas. Mark my words: Good, experienced guards decide games. Teams without solid guard
play fall early and often.
Which is not to say that the big men do not have a say in
winning games. It is much easier to score on the perimeter
when the defense has to respect the inside game. And it is virtually impossible to go far in the tourney without solid
rebounding. Guards handle the ball more and are more susceptible to pressure in the postseason, so they are a bit more
important in the NCAAs, but advancing with no post presence is a chore. Look no further than Florida this year when
spying for a school that is primed to exit the tourney soon due

Baseball drops home opener
BY MARK JANOFF

mjanoffl@swarthmore.edu

On Tuesday, the baseball team stepped on the
Swarthmore diamond for the first time since late fall, but
it didn't feel quite at home, dropping to the University of
the Sciences 3-2.
Jared Leiderman 'O5, the Garnet pitching ace who
earned all-conference honors last season, gave up only
two earned runs in eight innings of work. His effort had
the Garnet in the game throughout, and Swarthmore
managed to tie the game at 2-2 in the seventh. But an
eighth-inning wild pitch, which allowed USP's winning
runner to advance to third base and score on a sacrifice
fly, cost the Garnet a possible victory. "That error was a
past ball," co-captain Matt Goldstein 'O4 said. "[During
spring break] in Florida, there were some points where
guys were slipping up defensively, but I have confidence
that defense will be a strong part of our game."
Despite allowing only two earned runs, Leiderman
said, "It wasn't my best day. I gave up a lot of hits, and
the first batter up hit the ball really hard." But he man-

Nick Condo, giving up only one additional earned run on
10 hits, while striking out three.
Offensively, Swarthmore had trouble early on and
was held scoreless until the fourth inning, when shortstop Wes Sconce 'O4 drove home first baseman Jody

Fisher 'O4 on a fielder's choice. The Garnet scored their
second run in the seventh inning when Devils secondbaseman Brett Keenan mishandled a ground ball, allowing center-fielder Brandon King 'O5 to score from third.
King led the Garnet with three hits on the day.
Despite the loss, all phases of the game appear to have
improved since the team's stint in Florida over spring
break. "I don't think anyone would say we're happy
where we are," Leiderman said, "but I think things are
coming together a little bit." Added Goldstein, "I think all
aspects of the game have been improved upon since last
season. Outfield play has been real solid. The infield has
been great. Pitching has struggled a little bit in terms of
hits and walks, but it is going to come around. Jared is an.
