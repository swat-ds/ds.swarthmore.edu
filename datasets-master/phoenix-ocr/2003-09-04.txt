ITS battles Blaster worm, protects network

Staff, dorm technicians work around the clock to purge viruses
BY AMANDA BROWN-INZ

abrownil@swarthmore.edu

Prompted by the release of the Microsoft Blaster worm
and other malicious programs in mid-August, Information
Technology Services has had to take the unprecedented
action of individually checking every student's computer
for viruses and updating anti-virus software before the
computer is allowed onto the network.
MSBlast.B, a worm that attacks a flaw in some versions
of the Microsoft Windows operating system, was released
on Aug. 11 Manager ofClient Services Robin Jacobsen said
ITS was aware of the extreme danger the worm posed to a
college campus, where the program could use the network
to propagate itself. ITS staff installed a Microsoft software
patch, which fixed the vulnerability in the Windows operating system, on faculty and staff computers the week
before students returned to campus.

The ITS staff was aware that many students would need
the patch installed on their computers when they returned
to campus, so they devised a plan that would use network
regulation to test if a student's computer still contained the
vulnerability, Jacobsen said. ITS would then contact these

students on a case-by-case basis to fix the vulnerabilities.

Jacobsen said that the following week, about 260 early
returns and first-years connected their computers to the
network. Some users had failed to update their anti-virus
software and had allowed their computers to become infected, and the worm was readmitted to the network.
Computers that were not patched were now extremely
vulnerable to becoming infected by the worm. At the same
time, several other viruses were also released onto the network. "We saw computers getting infected within seconds
of signing on to the network," Jacobsen said.
The ITS staff noticed that the network was degrading
and could not handle the amount of data being transferred.
Because of the viruses and worms, there were 130,000
requests for packet transfers, a type of information
request, compared with the usual 5,000. The staff suspected that these problems were caused by students' computers rather than those of faculty or staff.
It was then, Manager of Networking and Systems Mark
Dumic said, that ITS made the decision to shut down the
entire residential network, something that has never before
been done. Following the outage, the requests for packets
returned to a normal level, confirming the suspicion that
the viruses and worms were on students' computers.
Jacobsen said ITS realized that it would have to use the
same diligence it had used with faculty and staff and check
every machine to prevent the spread of viruses to the network. "If one person in a dorm is sick, everyone gets sick,"
she said. "It's the same thing."
Last Thursday night, dorm technicians were told that
there had been a change in policy, according to Bill

Dorm technician Alexey Rostapshov 'O6 patches a computer and installsanti-virus software to prevent it from being infected with the Blaster worm or a virus.

Wanjohi 'O5, a dorm technician in Mertz. As the rest of the
student body returned to campus in late August, dorm technicians were instructed to inspect every student's computer for the Windows vulnerability, install anti-virus software, run a complete scan of the computer and set the antivirus software to run automatic weekly updates. Students
with laptops were asked to bring them to the ITS help desk
to expedite the process. Jacobsen said this process was fairly time-consuming and took anywhere from one hour to six
hours per computer.

Wanjohi said that since Thursday he had logged about
30 hours of work. He said his work as a dorm technician
this year was a "totally different job" from last year, when
he worked fewer than ten hours in the first few weeks of

school.
The unexpected hours that were logged by dorm technicians dealing with the crisis will have a "major budget
impact," Jacobsen said, although she did not yet know
what the exact amount would be. Other resources have also
suffered from ITS's preoccupation with the Blaster worm.

Jacobsen said the help desk had not been able to answer
questions immediately, that there were regrettably few ITS
representatives at first-year computer orientation and that
ITS has not been able to "pay as much attention to other
projects."
Jacobsen said that, by the end of the week, every computer will have been checked by dorm technicians.
Currently, over a thousand student computers have been
patched, scanned and updated. "We understand that people
are frustrated," Jacobsen said, "but we hope they understand that our job is to make the systems stable and
secure."
"You never know what's going to happen next," Dumic
said. "There's no guarantee that something new won't
come along and surprise us."

New options created for housing waiting list
BY SUE CHEN

schenl@swarthmore.edu

Four months after the

spring housing

lottery that left more students without
housing than ever before, everyone on the
May waiting list has been placed in college
housing, according to Director of
Residential Life Myrt Westphal.
There are 1,315 enrolled students living
in college housing this year, the most ever,
according to Westphal. The crunch was
attributed to fewer students electing to live
off campus and study abroad in the fall,
The Phoenix reported in May.
Facilities had to accommodate 48 more
students than usual, according to Associate

Vice President for Facilities Management
Stuart Hain.
Some waitlisted students were placed

THE PHOENIX

into the extra 45 to 50 spots Westphal had
set aside for incoming first-years and special needs students. Students who selected
rooms in the spring lottery but decided to
live elsewhere freed an additional 25 to 30
beds, Westphal said.
The college converted 1 Whittier Place,
505 Fieldhouse Lane and the seventh floor
of the Strath Haven apartments into student residences. Since neither Whittier nor
Fieldhouse Lane had ever housed students,
they underwent extensive renovations during the summer. To comply with state and
national occupancy codes, a fire detection
system had to be installed in the Whitter
building. Other additions included walls, a
hot water heater, sprinklers and a new

water line from the new science building.
The building on Fieldhouse Lane, which
used to be a farmhouse, was renovated by

one of six outside contractors the college
hired this summer. Changes include new

doors and windows, a heating system and a
restored bathroom. An old addition was
torn down and a new porch was built.
Information Technology Services also
installed network connections and phone
jacks, Hain said. Despite round-the-clock
work', 505 Fieldhouse Lane was not ready

September 4, 2003

for students until last Friday.

Lounges in Dana, Hallowell and Willets,
which have been used before as overflow
housing, also house formerly waitlisted
students. A number of first-year doubles in
Parrish East have been refitted as triples,
and one extra bed each was added to
Wharton and Worth, according to Hain.
Hain said that Facilities had $500,000
this year for dorm work. There was also
$385,000 that had been originally set aside
for installing sprinklers in Worth this summer. When renovation of the SEPTA
bridge cut off access to Dana and Hallowell,
camp programs instead housed campers in
Worth and the project was delayed, thus
freeing up the funds for use in dealing with
the housing crisis.

CJC decides to
readmit Boothe
BY BENJAMIN KABAK

bkabakl@swarthmore.edu
The College Judiciary Committee decided in May that
Ivan 800 the 'O5, who was arrested in April of 2002 in a

child pornography case, could return to Swarthmore after
serving his jail term for the criminal charges.
Two weeks before Boothe received a court sentencing,
the CJC came to its decision to allow him to return to
Swarthmore. Originally, the CJC had planned to wait to
issue a decision until after Boothe received a sentence

from the court.
"We didn't want to do it until after the court process
was complete," Dean of the College Bob Gross said, "but we
finally decided we had to have the hearing while students
were still here."
The CJC didn't announce its decision about Boothe
until June 6, four days after Boothe's sentencing.
Last year, Boothe pleaded guilty to one count of attempt
of unlawful contact or communication with a minor; one
count of criminal use of a communication facility; six
counts of dissemination of computer depictions; and one

One Whittier Place has been renovated to accomodate the housing crunch. It currently houses eight students.

Housing crunch resolved with new rooms
From HOUSING, pg. 3
The total expenditure from creating new dorm rooms was
unavailable as of press time. However, renovating the
buildings on Whittier Place and Fieldhouse Lane cost
approximately $200,000, and the college spent $68,916 on 60

sets offurniture for newly furnished rooms and to replace
various old pieces, according to Hain. The last student
from the May waiting list was placed into housing on
Aug. 15, Westphal said. She said she was grateful for the
students' understanding. "They showed great good humor
and patience, and I appreciated that," she said.
Many students on the waiting list were satisfied with
their rooms and did not find the experience stressful.
"I thought it was fine, because it all worked out,"
Emma Kalb 'O6 said. She and her roommate live in a
Whittier double with their own bathroom and fireplace.
Youngmee Hahn 'O5 is also happy with her Wharton
single. "At first, I was kind of nervous about it. Mostly, it
just seemed like I wasn't going to get anything, because of

how crazy it was at the lottery. But [Westphal] was very
reassuring, and, after a while, I just let it go and stopped
worrying about it," she said.
But not everyone is completely pleased with the experience. Annelise Garlin 'O6 and her roommate are living
in what was previously a Worth single. "We expected the
room to be small, but this is ridiculous," Garlin said.
The room has one bookshelf, one closet, one desk and
two beds. It was not until Tuesday that the two got a second phone and had their electricity outlet fixed. Garlin
said that she and her roommate are not planning to
request a room change, because they like the atmosphere
of Worth. And besides, "who knows where else we're
going to end up?" she said.
But it's uncertain whether the housing crunch will be
a problem again next year. "I don't know exactly if we're
going to be in the same boat or not," Westphal said.
Westphal said that, this year, she would like to investigate why there has been a decline of students electing to
live off campus.

Swat unaffected by federal budget cuts
BY ELIZABETH COLLINS
ecollin2@swa rthm ore. edu

State and federal budget cuts
over the past several years have
caused government support for
higher education to dwindle. While
public colleges and universities
have borne the brunt of the aid cuts,

Swarthmore's financial aid to students has not been affected.
According to an Aug. 30 New
York Times article, budget crises at
the state and federal levels have led
to drops in financial support for
higher education. As an increasing
number of high school graduates
attend college, the cost of higher
education has soared while states
take on ever smaller portions of the
tab.

As a result of these budget cuts,
public universities have been forced
to increase tuition sharply. The
University of Arizona increased

tuition by 39 percent last year, and
the State University of New York
has increased its tuition by 28 percent in an effort to compensate for
the decrease in government fund-

funding,

federal aid accounts for only five
percent of the college's financial aid

resources.
"Swarthmore relies on the support of generous alums and friends
of the college for the majority of its
financial aid funding," Talbot said.
"Swarthmore money has always
been able to fill in the gaps left when
government aid falls short of meeting a student's financial needs. Our
policy at Swarthmore has not
changed," she said.

count of possession ofchild pornography.
On June 2, Boothe was sentenced to 12 weekends in
prison. On weekdays, he was under electronic home monitoring, or house arrest. While the Pennsylvania court
determined that Boothe does not pose a threat as a "violent
sexual predator" and is not required to register as such
under Megan's Law, he faces three years of probation and
must undergo therapy until doctors see fit to release him.
The CJC had decided that Boothe had to finish out his
jail sentence before he could attend classes. "I would not
have been allowed to come back until the active part of my
sentence was over," Boothe said.
Although Boothe is free to use all college facilities and
has done so since classes started on Monday, the CJC has
placed a few restrictions on him.
Boothe was not permitted to live on campus prior to the
fall of 2004. Although he had chosen a room during the
housing lottery, he was forced to give it up. The CJC
described its reasoning for this decision in the prepared
statement issued June 6: "Because housing has already
been determined for the coming academic year, there is no
way to ensure that students who wantto avoid living in the
same building as [Boothe] had the opportunity to do so."
Furthermore, Boothe will be barred from living in
dorms where first-year students live because new students
do not have a choice as to where they will be living. Boothe
will be assigned a room prior to the housing lottery if he
decides to return to campus housing next fall.
The CJC also ruled that Boothe must continue his regular therapy while enrolled at Swarthmore. The committee said that, if Boothe is found guilty of any other violations of community standards, he will be expelled from the
college.
Boothe has been in therapy at the John J. Peters
Institute in Philadelphia for 11 months. The Institute
works with people who have committed sexually-related
crimes and the victims of these crimes.
In light of the CJC decision, Boothe said he felt the
Swarthmore community was not against his returning to
campus. "I wouldn't have wanted to come back ifI thought
the college community was against that," he said. "If the
CJC thought that the community was against my return, I
would have respected that decision."
Gross echoed Boothe's sentiments. "I would expect
people would give him a chance to explain himself," he
said. "We didn't see his behavior as something that would
ruin his life. I would expect that the community will give
Ivan a decent hearing."
So far, Boothe has faced little outspoken opposition to
his return. "No one has said anything negative to me in
person," he said. "I expect when I say my name is Ivan
Boothe for them to cringe, and no one does it. So either they
don't know, they don't care or they're hiding it very well."
Boothe said he understands that some people in the
community will not be receptive to his return. "I breached
the trust of the Swarthmore community, and I know that
for some people, I'll never be able to reconcile that," he
said. "I respect that other people aren't comfortable with

that.

"I don't know if people will forget about it or if it will be
in the back of their minds, but it's only two more years
here, so there's an endpoint," he said. "If the hostilities get
bad, I know there's an endpoint."

Another year, another drop in U.S. News rankings
BY MATTHEW FITTING
mfittinl@swarthmore.edu

When Swarthmore's ranking
dropped from second to third
among liberal arts colleges in the
2004 edition of U.S. News and
World Report, Elizabeth 100 didn't
notice, but her father did.

A senior from Bronx High
School of Science, 100 recently visited Swarthmore, which she read
about in a book of colleges and, she
said, simply found interesting.
"They're just numbers," she
said of the rankings, which can be
misleading. Her dad, however, is
always online checking them.
But 100 thinks her fellow classmates
and father "take it too
seriously." Not only are numbers
unreliable when picking a college,
she said, but the ratings don't
change much. Swarthmore, in fact,
has not been outside the top three
since the magazine began the rankings, usually along with Williams,
ranked first this year, and
Amherst.
"It's more on an individual
level," added Doris Yen, also from
Bronx Science. She said she would
look at the rankings to determine a
school's competitiveness, but
"wouldn't consider it a major factor. I think it's really about how I
fit in," she said.
Students need to make sure a
college or university is a match for
them, according to Dean of the
College Bob Gross '62. "We're not
looking for everybody," he said.
"We're looking for students who fit
into Swarthmore culture."
U.S. News has admitted its

rankings are not the only tool in
the college search process, according to Dean of Admissions and

Financial Aid Jim Bock '9O. The

magazine
recently published
guides on college essay writing
and campus profile collections. "At
best it should only be a starting
place," Bock said of the rankings.
"We expect [prospective students]
to take it further than that."

major category in the rankings
but only because "we want to make
sure it's a level playing field," the
dean said. "If other people are
counting them" and they are
"we're going to count them."
In addition, according to Bock,
the total number of classes with
fewer than 20 students, excluding
directed readings and independent

studies, has been dropping in
recent years due to a minor
increase in college enrollment.

Another area Gross cited as an

example of the college's inability
to alter the rankings is faculty
compensation. Swarthmore compensates its assistant and associate faculty better than competi-

tors like Amherst. But Amherst

employs more full-time professors
for which the rankings give
more points.
Gross also speculated that
tweaking criteria year to year is
partly because U.S. News wants to
consistently shake up the rankings. "If you had the same thing
every year," he said, "it wouldn't

be news."

Why the drop?
Outside of believing that personal experience should guide
those selecting colleges, Gross
said that, inaddition, the administration is wary to try to change
and in
Swarthmore's ranking
some cases is unable to.

Speculation that most colleges

methodology.

Swarthmore still leads in
terms of student selectivity,
which accounts for 15 percent
ranking

the
whole
(Williams comes in second,
and Amherst fourth).
Bock said the drop was in no

Budget cuts don't New IDs for first-years only
dampen orientation

"The replacement will be gradual, taking four

BY ELIZABETH BUCKNER

ebucknel@swarthmore.edu

While incoming first-years received a newly
designed identification card featuring the Scott
amphitheater and a garnet stripe, the ID cards will
be issued only to entering students and are not set
to replace the more than a thousand old cards currently in circulation, according to Director of
Publications JeffLott.

In addition to their new look, the new IDs feature a magnetic strip for Dining Services and a bar
code for the library. One of the practical advantages of the redesigned cards is that the bar codes
are printed directly on the plastic body of the cards,

rather than affixed as a sticker. This will prevent
the barcodes from peeling away.
Phillip Stern, the college's production coordinator, said that the college is becoming more aware of
its graphic identity, so it is important for that identity to be strongly represented in the new ID cards.
Stern said Student Council had brought the ID
cards to the attention of the administration in fall
2002. After three or four possible designs had been
developed, they were sent back to Student Council

for feedback.
The final design was sent for approval by
Information Technology Services, the libraries,

Dining Services, the Dean's Office and Public
Safety, and was agreed upon last May.
According to Lott, there are no plans to issue
new ID cards to upperclassmen, faculty or staff.

years to issue new cards to all students and even
longer for employees," Lott said.
Lott said upperclassmen would only be issued
the updated ID cards if they needed a replacement,
which will cost $lO.

"The replacement will be
gradual, taking four years to
issue new cards to all students
and even longer for employees."
Jeff Lott

Director of Publications
The new IDs were produced by Blackboard, Inc.,
the same company responsible for the online services used in many classes. No new technology was
required to print the new ID cards, which were purchased for about $1.30 each.
Stern added that the cards will be phased in over
the next five years for faculty and staff as well, so
that eventually everyone will use the same ID card.
The cards were not ready for new students when
they arrived on Aug. 26, but they were told to go to
Benjamin West later in the week to have their pictures taken.

the activities for first-years included a luau, a dance party, square
dancing, a barbecue, and a cabana coffeehouse.
Margarita Fermin 'O4, a member of the Orientation Committee,
said the OC had decided to change the theme of orientation from
"Wet Hot Swarthmore Summer" to "Pirates of the Caribbean" after
seeing the movie during the summer. "We saw the movie by chance
one day and loved it. We thought it would be fun and was a great way
to branch off into Caribbean-themed events," she said.

editorial

To all competitive Swatties: We're number three, deal with it
"We're number three! We're number three!"
No, it really doesn't have the same ring to it, does it?
Despite the hype about Quakerism and collective life,
Swatties are a diverse group, and we really don't experience
that many collective emotional reactions through the years.
There are, however, a couple of milestones most of us pass.
One that sticks in the mind is the day you get back a
progress report and realize that those letters aren't A's. The
day you realize that those halcyon high school days as the
smart kid are gone forever and that now you have to sweat
and study like everyone else. The day you have to explain
your less-than-perfect GPA to your parents. (If you are reading this and you are, in fact, a straight-A student, go away.)
Right now, the whole college is experiencing the effects
of post-first-B depression. According to the U.S. News and
World Report rankings, we are no longer number one. We
are no longer tied for number one. We are no longer even
number two hoping to recover number one. We are number
three, trapped behind longstanding rival Amherst in second place and upstart Williams sitting smugly in first for
the first time since, well, since we started paying attention.
This stinks.

THE PHOENIX

It rankles, it itches, it burns some little tiny part of us
deep beneath the skin. Like Hannibal when he faced the
Scipios, like Admiral Mikawa watching the American
bombers at Guadalcanal, like Muhammad Ali handing his
belt to Leon Spinks, we have faced, if not our Waterloo,
our Treaty of Fountainbleu. Our sense of wholeness, of
Tightness, of secure, confident, arrogant we're-numberone-ness has been shattered, and all the erudite historical
analogies in the world cannot make it better.
Of course, the larger, more rational part of us that was
smart enough to get admitted to Swarthmore understands
the context here. We know, or ought to know, that U.S.
News and World Report's opinion means about as much
as the results of Survivor II: that it's a big, callously
manipulated media show, that the magazine has to
change the ratings every year or people don't pay attention and that they probably felt the Swarthmore-Amherst

rivalry was getting to be old news. (Well, obviously it's
easier for us to say that nowadays, but still.)
And yet we owe our admission to Swarthmore to that
other little part of us, too, the overachieving, immature,
primal inner child who frames certificates and polishes troSeptember 4, 2003

phies and likes awards banquets and acceptance speeches.
There's nothing wrong with working hard to be a good,
selective, competitive school that U.S. News and World
Report would want to be its number one. There's nothing
wrong with being proud or even immaturely gleeful about
that, to some degree. But the key is recognizing that it is
immature, that it is gratuitous, and that being a good school
is more important than holding the title of best school.
Maybe it was the football cuts. Maybe it was an unfair
bias against independent study courses and associate faculty. Or maybe it's all invented to sell copies of U.S.
News. Who cares? If anyone had ever thought to suggest
changing policy to protect our rating while we were still
number one, we would have denounced them as unprincipled and petty, and rightly so. It seems, with the fingerpointing Al Bloom's attracting, that we forget all those
principles when the rating actually drops.
What do Swatties learn about B's by the end of freshman year? You don't scream. You don't blame your professor. You don't kill yourself. You accept it and try harder.
We all learned this individually, but some of us seem
to have yet to learn it as a community.

In the physical world, according to Newton's Third Law of
Motion, "Reaction is opposite and equal to action." In that world of
matter, motion and mathematics, action and reaction are always
perfectly balanced. But what about the metaphysical world of culture and civilization: morals, politics and economics? Newton's
Laws of Motion apply to physical objects, but what about metaphysical beings? Is there a metaphysical
world of "Social
Newtonianism"?
I say yes. But

TARU TAYLOR

P

I

in this world
reaction is never equal to action.
As a Social Newtonian, I restate
the Third Law of Motion thus:
"Proaction is more than equal to
action. Reaction is less than equal
to action." Bobby Fischer in his
prime, while playing the black
pieces, exemplified proaction, for
even with the black pieces he was
more than equal to any and all
opposition. But that's just chess.
Proaction is programs and policies. Reaction is cries and
protests. Proaction is volition and
willpower. Reaction is emotion

and sentiment. To proact is to
strategize and seize the initiative.
To react is to bitch and complain and seethe with resentment. To
proact is to command equity. To react is to demand equality.
Proaction is the stuff of heroes, the inspiration of heroworship. More than any other black man who ever walked North
American soil, possibly excepting only Booker T. Washington and
Malcolm X, proaction was the stuff of Marcus Garvey. It was the
stuff of his "New Negro." It was the stuff of the 122 men and women,
Garvey included, who signed the Declaration of Rights of the
Negro Peoples of the World, which declared, essentially, "Africa for
the Africans at home and abroad." When they signed it on August
13, 1920, they threw down the gauntlet of Pan-Africanism. Indeed,
that monument of proaction is the Magna Carta of Pan-Africa.
And I mean Pan-Africa, not the "African Diaspora." I ain't
Jewish. I live in no Diaspora. Consider Merriam-Webster's definition of "Diaspora": "la: The settling of scattered colonies of Jews
outside Palestine after the Babylonian exile, lb: The area outside
Palestine settled by Jews, lc: The Jews living outside Palestine or
modern Israel." The Ethiopian Jews and Sammy Davis Jr. have
lived in the "African Diaspora," but non-Jews living in any sort of
Diaspora is nonsense, at best sloppy scholarship. Let's keep it real.

Let's keep it Pan-African.
I kept it real last Sunday, August 31, per Article 53 of The
Declaration of Rights, "We proclaim the 31st day of August of each
year to be an international holiday to be observed by all Negroes."
As a Negro, I am worthy. But blacks who hide behind politically
correct euphemisms like "African-American" and "person ofcolor"
so as to anesthetize the psychic pain and deep shame they feel as
blacks are unworthy.
Whites, led by Episcopalian Anglo-Saxons, have proven themselves worthy of the 56 signers of the (North American
Propertied White Man's) Declaration of Independence. They
have proven themselves worthy of that political pantheon of
Manifest Destiny. The Declaration of Independence quite explicitly primed white America for its genocide of "the merciless
Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions." It goes
without saying that as of July 4, 1776, half the 56 signers owned
blacks and Jefferson himself owned some 200 pieces of black
chattel property. North American whites, Protestant, Catholic
and Jewish, have proven themselves worthy of Manifest Destiny
by staking their claim to its aftermath, the New World Order. But

blacks, under the reactive leadership ofDußois' Talented Tenth,
have proven themselves unworthy of Pan-Africanism. They
don't aspire to Garvey's legacy of proaction so as to stake their
claim to "Africa for the Africans at home and abroad." They, living in some politically correct pseudo-Jewish wonderland called
the "African Diaspora," are victims of white history. But PanAfricans are agents of black history.
Every July 4 the 56 men who signed the bible of Manifest
Destiny, and thus proactively met the challenge of British colonialism, are honored. They earned their holiday. Every August 31
I honor the 122 men and women who proactively met the challenge
of white supremacy by signing the bible of Pan-Africanism. They
earned their holiday. Will blacks rise to the Negro of Pan-Africa
and prove themselves worthy?

The price of the wired age
BY EVAN HENSLEIGH

ehenslel@swarthmore.edu

One of the inevitable events that typify the end of my
summer is getting to help all my friends pack for college
or move in. We talk about our various experiences,
which gives me a scattered view of a fairly diverse spectrum of institutions. The thing I took most note of this
year was the new policy at Michigan State University
they no longer supply students with phones. As it turns
out, Reed has done this for some time now, too. This is
due to two things
the rise of cell phones on campuses
and the replacement of telephones with e-mail and
instant messaging for communication.
Looking back on my time here, I can't remember the
last time I called a professor, and I tend to use e-mail
frequently with friends, too. It's become an integral part
of our campus life. I can't even imagine Swarthmore
without the daily quota of half a dozen reserved-students e-mails. (Did they use to leave reserved-students
voice-mails?) When I was a CA two years ago, I learned
that a sizable chunk of the freshman class already knew
each other well; the admissions office had set up an
admitted students' mailing list in April. When they
closed this list down at the beginning of summer, most
of the incoming students recreated the list on their own.
As if to drive the point home, I arrived here this year to
discover that I was living on the Friendster hall. At
least we had the good sense to lose the Love Monkey.
E-mailused to be compared to snail-mailall the time,
but these days it seems the telephone is an equally relevant analogy: As we become increasingly reliant on the
Internet and cell phones to talk to people, we are steadily weaned off the telephones on our desks. We get all our

class documents from Blackboard and reserve our

library books on Tripod. On campus, you can check
September 4, 2003

your e-mail anywhere, and cell phones let you talk
everywhere. Ten years ago, CS novices were stringing
network cables across the bay windows in Danawell. I
can hardly imagine what this place will be like in ten
more years.

All this increased communication comes at a price,
though. Despite our (rightly) virus-paranoid ITS department, e-mail opens the door for viruses, worms, Trojan
horses and other malicious programs to attack our computers. Thanks to the way the Swarthmore network is
set up, when we connect to the Internet we broadcast
not only the name of our college but also the dorm we're
connecting from to the world. Portable communication
lets people interrupt you anytime, anywhere. And, of
course, there's always spam.
I've always been plagued by an obsession with the
future, so I'm inclined to wonder at the consequences of
this slide into the Internet. What effect is this having on
us? It's certainly changed our classroom dynamics,
even in the three years I've been here, moving from
mostly paper-based classes in my freshman year to one
last year where all the resources assignments, study
guides, readings and so forth
were online, and the
assignments were to be handed in electronically. Even
more unusual was the professor who substituted running e-mail dialogues for written papers.
Of course, this leads to endless frustration when it
all goes wrong, as it does all too often. Ironically, my email broke down once while I was working on this arti-

cle. Phone communication, while less versatile, is
doggedly reliable. Even during the power outage a few
weeks ago, one thing that stayed on was the phone lines
although the cell phones were out. While there's talk
on some campuses of abandoning the phone system,
perhaps we should hang onto ours a little longer... even
if we never pick them up.

New amendment
for unequal rights
Although the original Constitution was essentially a blueprint
for our government, not a charter of rights, the Bill of Rights and
subsequent amendments have firmly entwined the Constitution
with the ideals ofindividual rights
and an equal society. Many
amendments have expanded our
civil rights, such as the 26th,
which lowered the voting age, or
made American society more
equal, such as the 15th and the
19th, which gave voting rights to
African-Americans and women.
Only one amendment has ever
tried to restrict our rights, and

that was the Prohibition amendment, which suffered the dubious
distinction of being the only constitutional amendment to be
repealed by another amendment.
Yet the next amendment may
well be one that specifically
denies a right to a certain class of

minority class as unequal to the
majority. The amendment in question is the proposed Federal
Marriage Amendment.
The Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA) reads, "Marriage in
the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a
woman. Neither this constitution or the constitution of any state,
nor state or federal law, shall be construed to require that marital status or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon unmarried couples or groups." It has been kicked around in conservative intellectual circles for a few years without gaining much
traction in Congress. Now, however, the recent Supreme Court
sodomy decision and an anticipated decision by the
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court have put gay rights, and
gay marriage in particular, front and center in the nation's seemingly neverending culture war.
Conservatives fear that the Massachusetts decision, if it forces
that state to grant civil marriage to same-sex couples, will unleash
a chain reaction of lawsuits based on two clauses of the
Constitution: the Full Faith and Credit clause and the Equal
Protection clause. The result could be court-imposed gay marriage
everywhere in the country. Equal marriage rights everywhere
would be a victory for equality, but court decisions have a tendency to trigger backlashes; the losing side, in this case conservatives,
can argue that unelected judges have subverted the democratic
will of the people. This argument is not frivolous; social change is
generally best achieved by the democratic process. Unfortunately,
most state legislatures are not ready to endorse the idea of samesex marriage, and this may be one of those issues, like school segregation and interracial marriage, in which the courts will have to
be the primary defenders of equal rights.
The recent Supreme Court sodomy decision was a potential
preview of future court decisions that could mandate equal marriage rights, and it has galvanized anti-gay marriage forces. Senate
Majority Leader Bill Frist declared his support for the FMA, and
President Bush, although he hedged on the FMA, made clear his
opposition to gay marriage and his desire to further reinforce
heterosexual-only marriage as the legal norm.
There can be no doubt that this is the most important gay
issue of our time. If the amendment passes, gay relationships
will be effectively declared unequal to straight ones by the

Constitution, and remember: Only one amendment has ever

been repealed.
So what must be done?
The religious right is mobilizing, determined to pass the
FMA. Those who support equal rights must mobilize in
response. There has to be a constant effort to make the Great
Middle (the many Americans who are generally accepting of
gays but do not support gay marriage) realize that the FMA does
not simply prohibit gay marriage, but also effectively blocks any
compromise or debate about the issue in the future. Even "mar-

riage lite" laws like civil unions or domestic partnerships could
be endangered by the amendment, since it specifies that state
law cannot require "the legal incidents" of marriage to be conferred upon unmarried couples. If it were to pass, the FMA
would be the first constitutional amendment to specifically deny
a right to a'minority group. No matter what your feelings about
gay marriage, such a mean-spirited amendment does not belong
in the Constitution.

CONNECTING THE OLD TO THE NEW: MARTIN TO THE SCIENCE CENTER
After its completion, the Science Center complex will house
half of the classrooms at Swarthmore, in addition to the new
Eldridge Commons area and a coffee bar that is already open for
business. The adminstration hopes the new facilities will draw yet
more talented scientists students and professors to the college.
"This is an indication of how much people in the Science
Center want other people to come teach here," biology professor
Rachel Merz said. While the Kirby Lecture Hall is closed, Martin
Building will remain the home of the biology department.
Renovations on Martin and old DuPont, which will house physics
and astronomy, computer science, and mathematics and statistics, will eventually unite the natural sciences side of campus.

Above, the walkway connecting Martin Building and the

Science Center, is slated to open at the end of the week following
a state inspection. Fritted glass, designed to prevent birds from
flying into the structure, will soon replace the temporary glass of
the walkway's walls. As in the Eldridge Commons, the two-paned
glass will feature white dots. On the walkway, the dots will appear

on the outside of the glass rather than on an interior pane.
The window manufacturer has never before used this structure
and is not guaranteeing its success for fear that exposure would
wear down the white dots. "It's a real experiment," Merz said.
The new coffee bar, shown below and at right, sells fresh sushi

MULTIMEDIA
LECTURE HALLS
The Science Center houses two large
lecture halls that feature state-of-the-art
multimedia equipment. The smaller of
the two halls (left) seats 80 people and
currently houses courses from the chemistry, math, psychology, political science
and English departments.
The largest lecture hall seats 200 peo-

ple, and has document cameras and
computer projection equipment for professors and speakers to use. The hall
may be used to show movies as well.

INTEGRATED LAB SPACE
As Ben Carlisle 'O5 and Brian Nolan 'O5
demostrate above, laboratories in the Science
Center are now in close proximity to instrument
and computer rooms so that students don't have
move to different parts of the building during lab
periods. All laboratories are fitted with multiple
fume hoods around the perimeter for ventilation,
and organic chemistry students will be able to do
all bench work in the hoods. Lower lab benches
and more space provide students with a "clean line
of sight" throughout the room. Table and floor surfaces have been tested for maximum chemical and
mechanical resistance as well as long-term durability. Because of tight scheduling during the construction, some physics lab periods are taking
place in chemistry laboratories this semester.
The entire building is equipped with climate
control, which has implications beyond comfort
when laboratory work is concerned. Many chemical reactions are moisture-sensitive, and control
over humidity will ensure that the outside weather
does not interfere with lab work. Constant coolness
will minimize vaporization of chemicals used in
the lab.
As for safety, instructors have always asked that
students be fully covered during labs, "and having
air conditioning means it is much more reasonable

to ask people to wear clothing that's appropriate,"
chemistry professor Paul Rablen said.

Navy cooks in World War II developed the

You've got to fight for your right to park

A few reasonable proposals on how to solve the college's parking problems
As Jack Johnson once observed, in his song that sounds
like the other one that sounds like the other one, "if you
wanna park here, you're gonna have to pay her." We can
only assume Jack Johnson was referring to the parking
problem at Swarthmore College, not a prostitute. Listen

JONATHAN FOMBONNE
EMIUANO RODRIGUEZ
Sobering Thoughts

Swatties bring cars to cam-

pus, but, this year, few students can find a place to

park. As such, our first column is devoted the parking
problem at Swarthmore.

The Great Debate: Crumhenge vs Parking-lot-henge
Let's face it. The board of managers (the people who
penny pinch the endowment) could have solved the problem a long time ago. The Crum is huge. I mean really big.
While some may disagree, it is because you never see
most of it. If we tore down the parts no one visits, built an
underground tunnel from Parrish to there and then a nice
2000 spot egalitarian parking lot, all our problems would
be solved. Another more feasible option two years ago
would have been a parking lot underneath the Science
Center. We could have imported the stone pillars from

Italy (freshmen: ask someone about the new dorm).
Unfortunately, Student Council shot down our ideas, and
we don't have a parking megaplex at Swarthmore. As
such, last year's parking committee left dozens of students
without places to park. The fact that the borough of
Swarthmore has fewer spaces this year only compounds
the problem.
So now the question arises, where does David Gentry
'O5 park his car without an official spot? First, do some
extensive research as to who has cars. Pick a few nerds

and honors majors and track their car usage. At least one
will undoubtedly never leave McCabe, so you can double
park him all year. If following around smart kids is not
your cup of tea, then just use your car to get everywhere.
Be at one with the squirrel; the more you move around, the
harder it will be for Public Safety to catch you. Install
another battery in your car so that you can leave your
flashers on for up to 10 hours while you are sleeping.
We also have a few supralegal suggestions. First, sophat all. Oddly enough, 'o6ers
omores don't deserve cars
seem to have nicer cars than everyone else. Steal one of
their cars, sell it in West Philly, and use the money to bribe
Terri Narkin for the space that just coincidentally opened
up. Also consider buying yourself a boot. Then you can
drive right up to Parrish Beach, toss the boot on your car,
check your mail, take it off and be on your way. Finally, if
you are really creative, go buy a sticker for your car that
says something like "Delco Wholesale Food Distributors"
and park in the Vendor Only spots behind Tarble and
...

Sharpies.

If you are just bitter, there are other wonderful solutions. Park in a Public Safety spot or fire zone. When someone says something, tell them to blow you; they should
have given you a parking space, and it's actually Student
Council's fault Kohlberg burned down. Also try off-roading. If you are going down, just go down in flames and tear

some stuff up in your Honda Civic before you are on the
boot list. If you don't mind the walk, also try parking at Al
Bloom's house.

Don't think that not solving this problem only inconveniences students. There are serious community harms
that stem from the lack of parking on campus. Fewer
spaces around campus means more cars parked in Parrish
Circle. With Jon about to attempt his permit test for the
third try, the possibility of his getting a license could have
dire consequences on the accident rate at Swarthmore. On
that fateful morning last November when Jon was frightened by a barefoot hippie running through the rain in

First, sophomores don't deserve
cars...at all. Steal one of their cars,
sell it in West Philly and use the
money to bribe Terri Narkin.
(Barefoot's disbelief in technology resulted
in his not seeing Jon's car), he crashed a jeep into a car in
Parrish Circle. After seeing the class of -07, we feel the
potential for barefoot-related traffic accidents is significantly higher than last year.
Students, unite. Park your cars on Parrish Beach and
refuse to move them. To each according to his need and
from each according to his ability. Wait, that makes no
sense. We need a parking space. Please, Terri, please.

'Dirty Pretty Things': dirty, pretty and important
BY ESTER BLOOM

eblooml@swarthmore.edu

When President Bill Clinton would not
stand up for Zoe Baird in the early 19905,
the United States got Janet Reno and a hot

topic of conversation: the plight of illegal

immigrants. The country debated whether
the fault lay with unfair immigration poli-

•

cies, the middle-class families who hire illegals as nannies and could potentially
underpay and exploit them or the immigrants themselves who are operating outside the system.
Sadly, this crucial conversation lasted
only about five minutes. Stephen Frears's
noir-ish social thriller "Dirty Pretty
Things" lasts significantly longer than that
and covers the issue in greater depth and
with more intelligence, complexity and
respect than the media managed when the
Baird scandal broke.

While this is a narrative film and does

not pretend to be a documentary, its onetwo punch of truth and beauty make it as
hard-hitting as a piece of investigative journalism and as easy to watch as a glossy TV
special.
Set in London, "Dirty Pretty Things"
revolves around Okwe (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a
brooding, handsome Nigerian doctor who

drives a taxi during the day and works a
front desk at a respectable hotel at night.
Instead of sleeping, he chews the leaves of a
plant that functions as a stimulant. Instead
of family or community, he has a group of
fellow taxi drivers, also immigrants, who
beg him to treat their cases of VD.
The only person Okwe can talk to is a
wry physician named Guo Yi (Benedict
Wong) and Okwe's only safe space is Guo
Yi's place of work, the hospital morgue.
There the two men play chess and when

14

Okwe wins, Guo Yi shrugs, commenting
insightfully, "Good at chess, bad at life."
Despite his hyper Protestant work ethic
and good intentions, Okwe indeed seems to
be bad at life. Starting from the moment,
late at night while at work at his hotel, that
he reaches into a toilet bowl to unclog it
and pulls out a human heart, it is clear that
no matter how fast Okwe moves or how
many continuous hours he manages to stay
awake, he will not be able to shake misfortune.
In a different film, a principled man
gathering clues towards the discovery of an
overwhelming system of corruption is told,
"Follow the money" Here, the motto for
Okwe is, "Follow the organs." Okwe has no
obligation (or time) to be doing detective
work, and indeed his boss, the casually
cruel, slicked-back hotel manager Juan
(Sergi Lopez,) advises him explicitly to
leave the matter alone. But having held the
heart of the matter in his hand, so to speak,
Okwe feels morally bound to discover the
truth.

The truth, of course, as befits a thriller,
is complicated, gruesome and involves
many wicked men as well as one young
Senay, played by a radiant Audrey Tautou ("Amelie"), is a devout
Muslim from Turkey, laboring as tirelessly
as Okwe to collect enough money to make it
to America.
Senay and Okwe both have a guiding
sense of what is right. Their characters and
their relationship, which is chaste but
weighted with an obvious mutual attraction, are the moral linchpin of the film.
When each is challenged, however, the film
reveals how near-impossible it can be to

beautiful woman.

sustain a moral life when as an individual
you have no power, no legal recourse and
almost no control even over yourself.

Chiwetel Ejiofor and Audrey Tautou confer about a few dirty pretty things.
The only white people in "Dirty Pretty
Things" are the immigration officials who
spend their time chasing down illegals.
They seem to exist in a parallel universe:
they are the served class while the focus of
the movie is on their invisible servants. Of
those, the ones who can exploit others do so
with abandon. The ones who must fight for

September 4, 2003

their lives, meanwhile, abandon everything
from scruples to body parts to the past.
Before the very last scene, in which "Dirty
Pretty Things" falters in its attempt to provide a superficial happy ending, the film
succeeds in bringing to light, without sentimentality, the underworld of the Western
world.

Upcoming drama productions go Greek, Fringe
An extinct Swarthmore tradition will
be revived this year as the Drama Board
devilishly plots to bring back the annual
"Shakespeare in the Crum" extravaganza,
a sequence of Shakespearean scenes
which will be performed with the pristine
Crum Woods as the hosting venue. The
Drama Board will soon host open readings of Shakespeare's work to bring
together students interested in participating in "Shakespeare in the Crum." The
annual Night of Scenes is also currently
being planned for later this semester.
Swarthmore sophomores Veronica
Betancourt and Eliza Cava will be codirecting a production of "Medea," a classic uplifting mythological tale written by
at
the
start
Euripides
of the
Peloponnesian Wars. Jason the Argonaut
returns home with his wife Medea after
his successful quest for the Golden Fleece
and betrays his homely bride to marry the
King's daughter. The story follows
Medea's dismal emotional struggle and
quest for the ultimate revenge against her
deceitful spouse.
Medea will be performed in the Greek
tragedy style with flapping tongues
behind masks and robes, with a full Greek
Chorus. It will be held in the amphitheater on October 24 and 25, with the final
scene concluding as the sun sets behind
the pristine Crum Woods. Auditions will
be held September 5 through 8; check the
Drama Bulletin Board for details.
For any self-assured aspiring directors,

the Drama Board is now enthusiastically
accepting proposals for both theater and
film productions. Check the bulletin
board just outside the post office for
instructions for submitting a proposal, or

Swat Actors on the Outside
As in years past, a Swarthmore presence pervades this year's Philadelphia
Fringe Festival, a furious orgy of theater,
film, spoken word, music, and a variety of
other forms of performance art that runs
August 29 through September 13. The
Stolen Chair Theater Company and the
Pig Iron Company are two among dozens
ofoutlandish performing arts groups from
across the country participating in a modern arts burlesque known as the
Philadelphia Fringe Festival.
The Stolen Chair Theater Company
was started here at Swarthmore in 1995. It

has grown to include Swarthmore seniors
Sam Dingman, Felicia Leicht, Audrey
Pernell, and Adrienne Mackey along with
Keetje Kuipers, Jon Stancato, Katherine
Walley, Kiran Rikhye, all graduates from
the class of 2002.
In the past, Stolen Chair has performed

a unique two-actor adaptation of S.
Ansky's "The Dybbuk: Between Two
Worlds," and a clever original creation,
"Portrait of Dora as a Young Man," which
debuted at the 2002 Fringe Festival and, of
the Festival's 237 shows, was the first to
sell out. Stolen Chair also recently created
and performed a world-premiere original
adaptation of

"Chikamatsu Monzaemon's

Bunraku Fair Ladies at a Game of Poem
Cards." This year they will be presenting

"Stage Kiss," an hour long theatrical piece
which the company describes as: "Boy
meets boy. Boy falls for boy. Turns out
both guys are dolls." In Stage Kiss, the
Stolen Chair Theatre Company will use
all the m's: music, make-up, masks and a
mannequin, to explore John Lyly's
Renaissance classic.
Another theater company with roots at
Swarthmore is the aptly named Pig Iron
Company, who will be performing an
avant-garde dance/physical theater play
titled "Cafeteria," a comedy and commentary on the American psyche. Three silent
cast members progress through junior
high school, business life, and retirement
homes, with a cafeteria operating as the
window through which the audience follows the progression of their lives. Pig
Iron is a "dance-clown-theater" ensemble
that was founded in 1995, and has created
and performed some 16 original works.

They have performed all over the world as
well as throughout this beautiful country,
from sea to shining sea.
Cafeteria will be performed nine times
September 3 through 7. More information
about the production and the Pig Iron
Theatre Company is available at www.pigiron.org. The Stolen Chair Theater
Company will be performing "Stage Kiss"
on five occasions between August 29 and
September 6. Further information about

Stolen Chair can be found on their website at www.stolenchair.org. For details

Celibate Swat? I think not. What you need to know.
A sobering, serious look at the dangers of unprotected sex at Swarthmore College
As a freshman, an upperclassman once told me that the
window of opportunity for hooking up and dating at Swat
existed only for three weeks after Orientation, so I had better get my ass in gear. I've since learned that though
indeed some Swatties do pretty much only have sex with
themselves (nothing wrong
with that), there are definitely
many more who miraculously
find time and inclination for
active sex lives. So please,
first year readers, don't
assume you'll never have to
know where to get condoms on
campus. I promise those of
you who assume that your

ongoing or that you will be

inactivity that it really isn't as

bleak as it seems. It seems that
at Swat even people who

ones spending all their money
on sex toys.
Clearly, some of the stereotypes about this school more
or less hold true. For instance, many people here, including yours truly, are self-described nerds, but nerds still
have sex. That's the upside, but unfortunately there is also
a downside, and that is STD risk. Upon setting foot on this
campus as freshmen, you are all leaving some of your baggage from the outside world behind, including your sexual
history. After recently sitting through a slide show of the
worst cases of herpes I could imagine (all I'm going to say
is that you would see them even if the person was wearing
pants), I feel compelled to further stress, to freshmen and
seasoned Swat veterans alike, that except for masturba-

tion, sexual experiences always come with risk, even in

our own little academic bubble.

Although we're living during an age in which somewhere between 20 and 25 percent of college students have

been infected with an STD, somehow the myth that this
epidemic only exists outside Swarthmore refuses to die.
What concerns me about the celibate Swat stereotype is
that it can encourage risky sexual practices, a dangerous
phenomenon considering Linda Echols, the amazing
woman at Worth who deals with all of our sexual drama,
sees cases of sexually transmitted diseases on our own
very campus regularly. To make matters worse, it's not

the ASU wellness website, 80% of women and 50% of men
who are infected with an STD show no symptoms.
Although all this seems very fatalistic, there are definitely steps you can take to lower your STD risk. First, you

should always be using condoms and/or dental dams.
Make sure that you and your partner are on the same page
about this before you hop into bed. Being sexually active
comes with the responsibility to protect the health of yourself and your partner. Using protection means that you are
mature enough to do that.
If you have been sexually active, it would be smart to
get an STD test at Worth, since they are easy and free, but

just about condoms or dental dams anymore. There was a
time when we were told
that as long as we used
barrier protection we'd be
fine, but the truth is that
people

realize that you could still be infected, because it does not

but I want to remind everyone that the two infections we

test for herpes or HPV.
Finally, be aware that while a no-strings-attached sexual encounter can be lots of fun, it can also be the riskiest
kind of sex, since you probably know absolutely nothing
about the person's sexual history. When alcohol is put into
this mix, impaired judgment may also cause you to engage
in dangerous sexual practices (e.g. without protection)
that you wouldn't normally.
If you have already been infected with an STD, it is
nothing to be ashamed of. We are all at risk for them, but
contracting one would be a pretty traumatic way to learn
that STDs exist at Swat. Don't you think?
Sarah Walsh is a junior. E-mail her at swalshl@swarth-

this no longer holds true.
I'm not going to dwell
on all the awful symptoms
of all the STDs, because I
know freshmen readers

are each most likely to contract, genital herpes (genital
sores) and HPV (genital warts which cause cervical cancer) are neither preventable by condom use nor curable.
Unlike some other STDs, like HIV/AIDS, these infections
are spread not by fluid transmission, but by skin-to-skin
contact, so even with barrier protection you can still
become infected. Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis are
all curable, but can mimic the flu, so they are often difficult to detect. Hepatitis B and C are not curable and can
sometimes lead to death, while HIV/AIDs, of course,
claims far too many lives each year.
Though just the symptoms of these STDs sound awful
enough, what is far more frightening is that according to

The women's field hockey team gets a
fresh start this year with a state-of-the-art
turf field and 11 promising new first-years.
The preseason has given them a
chance to adjust to the new playing conditions due to switching from grass to turf,
its artificial substitute. The difference
between the two surfaces, as Chloe Lewis
'O6 explained, is that "the turf game is a lot
more about skill and the grass game is a
lot more about strength." The ball moves
more quickly on turf, and players work
much more with the ball. "I love the turf.
It's a lot faster," Charlotte MacAusland 'O6
said.
"Playing turf hockey

is
new
game, and the players have worked hard
to learn all the technical and tactical
strategies needed to excel on this type of
surface," head coach Kelly Wilcox said.
The new turf benefits the spectators of
the sport as well. "It's a lot more fun to
watch," MacAusland said, "and a lot more
fun to play."
The surface change from grass to turf
has already spurred the team towards
optimism and excitement for the upcoming year. The team is especially pumped
about playing against Johns Hopkins, one
of its biggest conference rivals. Even
a whole

though the women's field hockey team is
not ranked as highly as Hopkins, the top
team in the conference, the games against
each other have always been close. Prior
to the field change, the team was at a disadvantage when it played on Hopkins' turf

In addition to the surface change, the

Teams with strong defenses and running games succeed in NFL
When predicting the outcome of the professional football
one concept must remain foremost in one's mind: It
is clearly idiocy. Football in this era is ruled by parity. I
would venture that of the 32 NFL teams about 25 of them
have at least an outside chance of qualifying for one of the 12
playoff spots. Recent Super Bowl history abounds with surprise champions. It doesn't take long to get good, and it does
not take long to get bad.
However, even in today's
era of insane parity, certain
indicators of quality persist.
A dominant defense. A
strong running game. A
quarterback who manages
the game well. More
turnovers gained than lost.
Quality special teams. An
adequate backup quarterback. The ability to play in
the cold and on grass. Youth
and luck. Good teams have
these qualities, and bad
season,

BEN WHARTON

ones don't.

So without further ado,
let's hit the specifics.
Starting in the NFC, I see
the Packers winning the
North, for no other reason than that somebody has to.
Minnesota is on the rise as are the Lions, but neither is
ready to supplant Favre's Packers yet.
Out of the NFC East, I see the Eagles continuing their
dominance. They're consistent and desperate to win after
coming very close for the last two years. The Giants have
great weapons at the offensive skill positions, but the
defense is shaky, as is the offensive line. The Cowboys and
Redskins are both at least another year away from contend-

defensive coordinator Ray Rhodes has vastly improved the
defense and the offense was roaring at the end oflast season.
As for San Francisco, I'm not sold on Jeff Garcia's health.
Arizona is still Arizona.
In the NFC South, the Buccaneers have been top dog for
a while. That ends this year. Repeating as Super Bowl champ

is pretty much the hardest achievement in team sports,
especially when you play in the toughest division in football
and have questions at running back and offensive line. The
Falcons should usurp the Bucs' division crown, even with
Michael Vick missing four games against weak opponents.
The Panthers could very well win a wild card berth, with a
savage defense and strong running game. The Saints could
play late season spoiler, but don't yet have the defense to
challenge.
On to

the AFC. The Ravens again have a punishing
defense, along with a possible savior at quarterback.
Cleveland got rocked by the salary cap, so forget about them.
I would like to formally announce that the Steelers run of
good football is coming to an end. Amos Zeroue hasn't shown
the durability to play every down and I don't see Tommy
Maddox staying healthy. And Joey Porter just got shot in the
ass. Cincinnati's turned things around, but they're still a
year away.
In the South, Payton Manning and the Colts are a great
regular season team, and will probably make the playoffs
only to get blown out again. I think the Jaguars are the dark
horse. Byron Leftwich is absolutely the real deal. If I were
opponents, I'd avoid hitting Mark Brunell hard at all costs.
The Titans are playing on borrowed time with Steve McNair
and Eddie George, and Houston is still searching for
answers.

The AFC East looked pretty good until Chad Pennington
went down for most of the season with a wrist injury, compounding the Jets' offseason free agency woes. I think the
Bills are now the team to beat. The offense should be strong
again and the defense has greatly improved. The Dolphins
are again an enigma. This year might as well be the year
they finally put things together. The Patriots still lack a running game, so I don't see much in store for them.
Finally, in the AFC West, I think the Chiefs have

September 4, 2003

improved the defense enough to support their ridiculous

offensive prowess. The geriatrics on the Raiders blew their
best chance last year when they lost the Super Bowl. The
Broncos got Jake Plummer in the offseason, which is an
improvement on Brian Griese, but I don't think he's the
answer in Denver. The Chargers may be this year's Chiefs in
that their offense will be great and their defense will suck.
So, of the 25 teams that might make the playoffs, which
one will be left standing after a grueling playoff drive?
C'mon, that one's a no brainer. The Baltimore Ravens, obviously.

triumph of the everyman.

The retirement ceremony held last week in Sampras's
honor was, like his career, classy. There were nice speeches from rivals, but also his infant son perched in his arms
symbolizing the next direction of his life, and just in case
anyone forgot about his regular status, a little paunch and
lots of chest hair peeking through his gray collared shirt.

itable New York City gruffness, it's tennis's most challenging competition— but he will ultimately be an irrelevant
footnote. For the past decade, for a player to even consider
winning a Grand Slam or overtaking the top ranking, he
had to worry about beating Sampras first. Now Sampras is
gone, and a large, empty shadow hangs over Flushing
Meadows' tennis complex and the rest of the sport. His
one-handed backhand, swooping forehand and picture-perfect serve down the service line are gone probably forever, as Sampras has said in interviews comments like,
"To shut it out [of my life] has been nice," but here's to hoping he rediscovers that competitive fire. Please come back
soon, Pete. Remind everyone that you are an athletic treasure.

Volleyball dig deep to defeat SUNY New Paltz
BY ALEX KALKSTEIN

akalkstl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore women's volleyball is off to a solid
start this year. The team is energized and ready
for a different kind of year than those past. Head
coach Harleigh Leach is back for a second season
and the team welcomes four new first-years to the
roster.

The first-year women aren't the only new additions to the team: Swat volleyball welcomes new
assistant coach Erin O'Connell. O'Connell, as captain of Kutztown University's volleyball team, led

her team to the conference championships.
Last weekend, Swat competed in the Skidmore
Early Bird Tournament placing fifth with a 1-2
record. The Garnet lost to RIT 3-0 and SUNY
Cortland 3-0 while beating SUNY New Paltz 3-2 (3016, 30-28, 28-30, 27-30, 15-13). Returning sophomore
right side Emily Conlon started the year with a
blast making 45 assists for the Swarthmore offense
and junior Natalie Dunphy contributed 18 kills on
a strong performance. Patrice Berry 'O6 and Tanya
Gonzales 'O6 made significant contributions to the
team's defense accruing 28 and 16 digs respectively.
Coach Leach admitted that last weekend's tournament "prepared us for reality" but sees the team
continuing to focus on its strong defense. She
expects the team to have a better showing in the
Centennial Conference and continue to improve

as the season progresses.
Outside hitter Erica George 'O7 of Mountain
Pointe High School in Phoenix, Ariz, noticed the
team's dynamics immediately at last weekend's
Skidmore Early Bird Tournament. George noticed
that the "first time playing together as a team, we
had a lot of chemistry." She was concerned with

THE PHOENIX

the volleyball environment that she would find
outside of her highly competitive state of Arizona
but was thoroughly impressed with the hustle and
effort put in by every member of the Swat squad,
noting that all the members of the team "work
their butts off."
Aside from George, the Garnet also welcome
first-year outside hitters Stephanie Koskowich of
Salt Lake City, Utah and Danielle Toaltoan of
Downington, Penns. along with setter Amy
Stocker of Cassville, N.Y
Although last year's season was a bit of disappointment for Tanya Gonzales 'O6, she saw a real
change in the environment of the team and thinks
this season will be a marked improvement.
Gonzales also noticed a significant increase in the
intra-team competition that propels the players to
work harder, which she hopes will result in a better team. As a result of the larger size of this

year's team Gonzales notices a more supportive
team dynamic.
Co-captain Emma Benn 'O4 is also very excited
about this year's prospects. In her words, the
Skidmore Tournament provided a chance "to see
what [the team] needs to work on before the season starts." Benn, also an outside hitter, has seen
the team through three coaches in her four years
of playing at Swarthmore and welcomes coach
Leach's outstanding commitment to the team and
increasing the skill and teamwork found in
Swarthmore women's volleyball.
The Garnet hosts a tri-match against the
Merchant Marine Academy and William Patterson
this Saturday, Sept. 6 starting at 11 a.m. The home
games will be even more jazzed up than before:
now at every game played at home Swarthmore
Pizza is offering free pizza to anyone who wins in
a half-time serving contest.
September 4, 2003

To cap it all off, the show will be a salute to our military troops
Word has it that Paul Tagliabue, commissioner of the NFL, even met
with General Richard Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to
help plan the event. An excerpt from their conversation:
Tagliabue: "Mr. Chairman, I'd like to do a concert for your troops

overseas."
Myers: "OK, I'm listening."
Tagliabue: "Well, Britney Spears will perform in a little skimpy putfit."
Myers: "I'm sold. My boys in Iraq are about her age. They'll love it."
As if the evening won't be entertaining enough, when the concert
ends the football will begin as the Jets visit the Redskins (i.e. the Old
Jets). You might recall last spring's free agent signing period where the
Redskins, my Redskins, signed the entire Jets roster. So far feedback
has been positive: Last year the Redskins were 4-1 in the preseason en
route to a 7-9 season. This preseason they were 1-3. Judging from last
year's preseason to season turnaround, the Redskins are going to the
Super Bowl.
Excuse me, Carlton, the Redskins are going to the Super Bowl? The
same Redskins who have no defensive line and a second year quarter-

back?

That's right, you read correctly. The Redskins are going to the Super
Bowl.
In the NFC East, my 'Skins will check in with a 12-4 record. They will
be closely followed by the 11-5 Eagles who, despite having nobody on
offense save McNabb, have a great coach who will lead them to anoth
er playoff appearance. The underrated Giants, with a potentially explosive offense, will miss out on the playoffs. They will finish 9-7. The
Cowboys? New coach, same old losing season.
In the NFC North, the Packers are no longer the team to beat
Though Gilbert Brown is valiant in his efforts to play the season with a
torn biceps muscle, the Packers will slip to a 9-7 record as an aging Brett
Favre fails to lead his team to the playoffs in his final season. The
Vikings, with the dangerous Culpepper to Moss connection, will win
the division at 10-6. Though the Bears move back to Soldier Field and
Anthony Thomas will regain his 2001 form, the team is also led by
Kordell Stewart. With the addition of Charles Rogers to Detroit, the
Lions will edge out the Bears for third place.
The Bucs will clean up in the NFC South as Atlanta plays the first
half of its season without Michael Vick. Carolina's defense will make its
games close, but with no reliable quarterback, they will have another
losing season. The Saints are strong offensively, but with no defense
they don't stand a chance.
The NFC West has three high-powered offenses and one atrocious
team. The reemergence of Kurt Warner and a healthy Marshall Faulk
will make St. Louis a top target, and the Garcia-TO connection will sin
glehandedly lead the Niners to a handful of victories and a wild care
spot.
In the AFC

wait a second, does anybody really care about the AFC?
Since the answer is no, I will be brief and say the Steelers win the AFC
North with the Ravens being a wild-card pick. The Titans and Colts will
be two strong playoff teams from the AFC South with a healthy Steve
McNair leading his team to a Super Bowl loss against the Redskins. The
Dolphins will edge out the Bills in the AFC East, and Broncos will nar
rowly edge both the Raiders and Chargers to come out of the AFC West

Serve, set, match
Which episode of Pete Sampras's career should be considered the most triumphant? Single-handedly winning the 1995

Davis Cup for America? His scamper up the stands of
Wimbledon's Centre Court to find his parents, first-time audience members, after winning the 2000 final to break the
record for most Grand Slam championships? The magical
comeback at last year's US
Open, which concluded with
an afternoon of unmatchable
tennis against Andre Agassi
for Sampras's final tennis
title? Or, the trying fortnight
at the 1996 French Open
when he won three five-set
matches in five days, all

while looking disconsolate on
the sidelines as his coach
Tim Gullickson remained in
the States dying from cancer?
My
nomination
is
Sampras's 1996 US Open
AARON WASSERMAN quarterfinal match against
Alex Corretja. In the fifth-set
tiebreaker, Sampras looked
The Underdogs
vulnerable, no, wounded; he
staggered along the baseline
between points, his eyes
rolled back into his head and his shirt hung limply from his
body as he leaned in to return serve. Then, mid-tiebreaker he
wandered to the back wall hunched over his racket and puked
everywhere. He returned to the court, won the tiebreaker, the
match and the whole tournament. Remarkable.
Tennis's episodic nature suits Sampras's career arc well,
but maybe his career can't be fully appreciated unless viewed
from a bird's-eye perspective in order to absorb all the longterm accomplishments. He is the youngest male US Open
champion; he had a 56-1 record and seven titles at Wimbledon
in an eight-year period; he spent six consecutive years ranked
the world's best tennis player; and he won 14 Grand Slam
championships, the most of any male.
How is it possible that some don't consider Sampras to be
the best tennis player ever? Some criticize his inability to win
the French Open, whose red clay never suited Sampras's
game; some think the greats from an earlier generation, Rod
Laver and Roy Emerson, would've won more if not for different rules regarding professional status. These arguments are
merited, but flawed because Sampras played in an era in
which every player is superbly conditioned and muscular,

and the equipment so well designed it provides relatively
mediocre players with unimaginable power. Most importantly, he played in an era in which opponents specialize in mas-

tering different court surfaces, making it nearly impossible
for any player to consistently win Grand Slam tournaments.
Yet, Sampras defeated them all. His Grand Slam record is the
only modern sports record
along with Joe DiMaggio's 56game hitting streak
that will never be broken.
Other critics even prefer Andre Agassi, Sampras's main
foe through his career, as the better player because Agassi
was the more marketable one. This swipe is more perplexing
because Sampras had the attributes to appeal to the mainstream, but no advertising executive ever found the correct
approach to do so. Sampras's serve-and-volley playing style
possessed assembly-line efficiency: a thunderous serve foldigging balls from his feet,
lowed by beautiful net-play
lunges to his sides and short jumps to meet overhead smashes; points and opponents were controlled quickly. His modest
court and interview mannerisms reflected a devoted work
ethic. His lean, non-chiseled body type, panting open mouth,
simple court attire and prominent bald spot represented the

Garnet capture Swat Kick Classic crown
BY REUBEN HEYMAN-KANTOR
rheymanl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore women's soccer team sent a strong
message to the rest of the Centennial Conference this
weekend by capturing the title of the Eighth Annual
Swat Kick Classic. The Garnet Tide now looks to
improve on a 10-9 (5-5) season a year ago that left the
team a single game out of the Centennial Conference
postseason.
In the semifinal match on Saturday, Swarthmore
was able to withstand the grueling midday heat to beat
Alvernia College 4-1 With the game tied 1-1 in the 73rd
minute, Natalie Negrey 'O7 put the Garnet Tide ahead

After losing only two seniors to graduation last year
and gaining a strong freshman class, the Swarthmore
women's soccer program is undoubtedly on the rise.
While this year's squad is led by captains McCaffrey,
Rebecca Rogers 'O4 and Salussolia, the team's junior
class provides much of the depth that the team will need
to compete in the later stages of its grueling faU season.

on
Saturday night, the weather was far cooler for the
Sunday championship game against Widener College.
Shavaugn Lewis 'O5 scored the game's lone goal in the
105th minute of play to give Swarthmore the 1-0 victory
and the Swat Kick Classic title. The speed of Widener's
backline and the play of Swarthmore goalkeeper
Catherine Salussolia 'O4 had kept the game scoreless
through the first 90 minutes of play. In the second overtime, streaking down the center of the field, Lewis took
a feed from Becky Strauss 'O6 and tucked the ball past a
charging Widener goalkeeper to give the Garnet Tide
the victory and a 2-0 start to the 2003 season.

Salussolia, the team's co-MVP the last two seasons
and a 2002 all-Centennial Conference honorable mention, will once again control the defense from the goal
this year, as Swarthmore looks to implement a new
defensive system. Last season, the Garnet Tide used a
diamond defense that featured Ele Forbes 'O5 as the
team's sweeper, a role that earned her first team allconference honors. This year, coach Amy Brunner

decided to implement a flat-back-four scheme that

should eliminate some of the shooting and passing
lanes that the Centennial Conference's better teams
were able to exploit last season. "In the past, our defen
sive shape has been poor and our defenders haven't
been able to support each other as much as we would
like. With the new system, our defense will also be able
to better support the attack so that we can go from
defense to offense more quickly,"
Brunner said.
The defensive group primarily
responsible for implementing the new
system mixes experience with youth.
0
The two center-back positions will be
filled primarily by Forbes and Jordan
Shakeshaft 'O5, supported by Rachel Jacobs 'O5. The
role of outside back will fall to Rogers and first-year
sensation Kasie Groom 'O7.
McCaffrey and last year's co-MVP Tanya Hahnel 'O5
will roam the midfield with fellow returning starter
Sarah Hobbs 'O6. They are joined by a strong supporting cast including Jane Sachs 'O7, who like Groom wil]
have to learn to deal with the more physical college
game on the fly.
In the attack, co-leading scorer Lewis looks to continue her scoring ways. She will be supported by
