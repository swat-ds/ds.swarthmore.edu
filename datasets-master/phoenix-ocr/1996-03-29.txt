Black Alumni Weekend Colloquium Focuses on Future ofDiversity Here
By

Jessica Harbour

This past Saturday, a colloquium
met in the Black Cultural Center to

discuss issues, both immediate and
future, facing Swarthmore's AfricanAmerican community. Organized to
compose a document to present to the
Council on Educational Policy next
fall, the colloquium was deliberately
scheduled to take place during Black
Alumni Weekend so thatalumni could
share their perspectives with current
faculty, staff, and students.
The document will concern what
direction the black community wants
to travel in and what measures it
believes CEP should take in the next
ten years to create a more diverse
Swarthmore. To make it, the participants in the colloquium—there were
about forty people in total, made up

of roughly equal numbers of black
faculty, staff, students, and alumni—divided themselves into five groups,
each with its own focus: faculty hir-'
ing; admissions; academic support;
staff hiring; and curriculum improvements. After they met, all the participants came back together and gave
reports which led to the drafting of
the comprehensive document.
Organizers of the event included
Kesia Constantine '96, RobertHarris
'96, Patrice Bone '96, Angela Mrema
'96, and Rebeccah Bennett '96. "We
wanted to see a vision created before
we graduated," saidBennett. Another
student added that the colloquium
was less of a legacy than a necessity,
and that organizing it was the "most
tangible" thing they could have done
for the Swarthmore black community. The idea had been in the works

since mid-February; the principal
organizers compiled preliminary reports and met with administrators
including President Al Bloom, Provost Jennie Keith, Dean Ngina
Lythcott, and Associate Dean Bob
Gross. In the initial planning stages,
many students who couldn't attend
the colloquium lent a helping hand.
Apparently efforts to increase diversity at Swarthmore, while steadily
growing, have never truly been coordinated; the colloquium was a step in
this direction. The colloquium was
also necessary because "the College
likes to be methodical" in planning
its future actions, explained Bennett,
"and the same thing needs to be done
for diversity." She described the black
community' s contribution to the overall vision of CEP as "a chip in the
cookie." She added that such plans

hadn't been made since the late '6os
and early '7os, when black students
in SASS protested for the creation of
the BCC, increased hiring of black
professors, and a greater effort in the
admissionsoffice to recruit black students. "Society's changed," she said,
"and yet some of the issues and problems we're dealing with haven't
changed."A case in point, featured in
the premiere issueof OurStory, would
be the low numbers ofblack students
now at Swarthmore, making up just
five percent of the student population
as opposed to about twelve percent of
the total American population.
According to Bennett and other
participants, the College administration supported the colloquium from
the start. In order that the leaders
could better compile their preliminary reports, the College supplied

Erik Huneke

Tanisha Little' 97 and Aisha MossKoonce '97, who will begin their
tenure as co-coordinators of the Social Affairs Committee on April 1,
plan to write a new constitution detailing the committee's goals and allocation rules.
Little notes that in surveys of colleges, Swarthmore is "right at the top
in terms ofacademics," but not for its
social atmosphere. They hope to solve
this by enhancing SAC's presence.
In order to bring accomplish this,
Little notes, "We'd like to do a lot
more advertising for SAC" so that
there is "more communication between SAC and the general student
body." As a first step, Little and MossKoonce will hold an all-campus study
break to introduce themselves at the
beginning of the next academic year.
They would also like to make increased use of the group's bulletin
board and to set up suggestion boxes
to encourage greater student input.
Moss-Koonce wants to make sure
"that people [know they] can come to
us for impromptu activities," not just
for planning weekend parties.
They hope to organize Parrish
Beach Fridays with concerts and to
encourage Sharpies to serve food
outdoors. They plan to install a stereo
system and perhaps a snack vending
machine in the gameroom. TV nights
complete with food and other activities could turn the Seinfeld-FriendsER ritual into acampus bonding event.
In the interest of what Moss-

Koonce considers to be making "creative use of the space we already
have," they hope to extend Essie
Mae's hours of business, even if this
would involve hiring student personnel. They hope to follow up on the
desire of Student Activities Coordinator Jen Leigh to install a magazine
rack in the Tarble lounge area. They
also intend to encourage "SAC members to do more planning" in implementing creative ideas. Although they
intend to maintain informal contacts
with those outside of the committee,
Little would "be worried about approaching people to do events" because of the potential appearance of
favoritism.
Although Little feels that "you
don't need to get drunk to have a
good time," she does not wantto "be
the alcohol police for the campus."
They intend to work closely with
Associate Dean Bob Gross and Assistant Dean Tedd Goundie in implementing theCollege's alcohol policy.
In order to abide by SAC's own principle of not funding alcohol, they
intend to set standardized amounts
for specific types of parties so as not
to grant extra money which might be

used for alcohol.
Little is also Budget Committee
Treasurer. She said that "there is no
conflict of interest," since a liaison
between Budget Committee and the
Social Affairs Committee will serve
as a balancing force. She also said
that since "both BC and SAC are
open committees," anyone interested
could observe their proceedings.

Change Comes Slowly to Post-Apartheid South Africa
By

Matt Reed

Over spring break, Heather Settle
'96, MaurisaThompson '9B, and Jude
Uzonwanne '9B and I traveled to
South Africa as part of the 1996 TriCollege Peace Studies Mission, along
with professors and students from
Bryn Mawr and Haverford.
Three subgroups went to Cape
Town, Port Elizabeth and
Grahmstown, and Durban, and we all
spent time in Johannesburg. I was in
the Durban group, and was focusing
on primary and secondary education.
In education, as in many areas of life,
the changes in SouthAfrica in the last
few years have been uneven.
The schools we visited in KwaZulu/
Natal in a township and a rural area
outside Durban had seen little change
in the amount or source oftheir funding, the community of students they
serve, or anything else. Schools which
have generally had more resources
allocated to them, such as formerly
all-white or all-Indian schools, still
have more resources, but in many
cases, now have fairlyracially mixed
student bodies.
This means that some black students are now getting the benefits of
the resources in those schools that
were previously denied to them. The
number of black students who can
take advantage of those opportunities is limited by a number offactors:
there aren't enough of those already
better-resourced schools to serve everyone, and at least for now, many of
them charge high school fees.
In general, the change in government and the end of officially sanctioned racial segregation and discrimination seems to have benefited arelatively small class of blacks rather

quickly, while it will take much longer
for changes to reach the rest of the
population. As Jude notes, there is a
new, emerging black middle class of
entrepreneurs, policy-makers, and
others who are part of the new multiracial South African elite.
Jude's focus was on economic issues, and he reports that economically, South Africa is in good shape.
He notes that the business
community' s confidence is illustrated
by the recent surge of foreign direct
investment into South Africa. "As
the Deputy Chief of Mission at the
American Embassy in Pretoria intimated," Jude recalls, "it is no longer
an issue of wait and see. It is now a
question of when the final clauses of
contracts will be negotiated."
Efforts are underway to provide
houses, electricity, more schools and
teachers, and other basic resources to
large segments of the population, and
in some places, the effects of these
efforts were already visible. I also
saw communities of squatter shacks
in urban and rural communities, however, that demonstrate that there is a
long way to go.
One of the themes that came up
again and again for me was a sense of
the privilege we had in being able to
fly all the way to South Africa, travel
around the country and talk to all
kinds of people, and come back after
11 days to our daily lives with whatever we got out of the trip.
The nature of my position of privilege and the responsibility I am taking on in making a trip like this was
brought home to me when students
and teachers in one school, after telling me what theirschool needs, asked
me ifI could bring them those things.
While I had to refuse theirrequests,

eating" —that the success of the
colloquium rested mainly on whether
she could come back in 2006, as an
alumna, and find a "diverse and dynamic" Swarthmore. "The question
of whether or not it works is whether
or not the College does better with its
black population." Still, she emphasized that the goals of the colloquium
had been achieved. She also said this
would be a good ideafor other groups
on campus to try—"Whatever group
can stand to think about its future in
[Swarthmore's] world" should "embark upon a plan for themselves."
Ly thcott concluded, "I thought [the
BCC colloquium) was a wonderful
opportunity for students, faculty,
staff, and alumni to think about the
relationship between the College and
the African American community
which has such a rich history."

them with aggregate data from the
Admissions Office for the last 25
years. "We're not being normative
about our assessments," pointed out
Bennett. Another student spoke of a
"lot of administrative cooperation"
and expressed hope that the
colloquium's documentwould be received warmly in the fall. Before
that, it will be presented to the entire
faculty, so the entire campus can assess it and, in the hopes of the participants, rally for it.
Several participants agreed that it
had been very worthwhile. Lythcott
called it "a wonderful opportunity for
students, faculty, staff, and alumni to
think about the relationship between
the College and the African-American community which has such a rich
history." However, Bennett added
that "the test of the pudding is in the

I did promise to tell people I met in
South Africa and in the United States
about what I had seen on my trip, and
do what I could. That is the least I
could do to fulfill the responsibilities
that come with the privileges inherent in a trip of this sort.
It's hard to capture the essence of
an intense, 11-day trip in an article

like this, so if you would like to hear
more about of our stories, research
findings, and thoughts on the trip, I'd
like to invite you to come to our

Acceptance Letters Mailed
to Swarthmore Class of '00
By

Patrick Runkle

The Class of 2000 is on its way.
The Office ofAdmissions planned to
mail acceptance letters today to 1,203
accepted students from around the
world.
"We are thrilled with the Class of
2000," said Director of Admissions
Susan Untereker in a e-mail message

Wednesday.
According to Untereker, the breakdown of admitted students by geographic region is:
•New England—125 students;

•Mid-Atlantic—s2o;
•South—l23;
•West—l4B;
•Midwest—lo3;
•Mountain States—31;
•Southwest—58;

•U.S. Territories—7;
•Americans living abroad—27; and
•Foreign nationals—6l.
The ethnic make-up of the admitted students, excluding foreign na-

tionals, is:
•African American/Black—l3l;

•Latino —128;
•Asian American—144;
•Native American—3; and
•Other or Bi-, Multi-racial—46.
Those who chose not to identify their
ethnicity number 186.
"We visitevery school we possibly
can based on statistics that indicate
potential Swatties, history with the
school and good leads from other
professionals, the media, current
Swatties, alumni, etc.," Untereker
said.
"Recruiting is affected by school
visits because students get personal
attention from admissions professionals, and counselors get educated or
updated and can, presumably, do a
better jobin encouraging appropriate
candidates to apply."
The Admissions Office's efforts
have yielded 749 students from public and public magnet schools, 345
from private/independent schools,
and 35 from parochial/religious affiliated schools, not including foreign nationals and Americans living
abroad.

Students and faculty met Wednesday to discuss the probable termination next year of the international
relations concentration.
According to the College's fiveyear plan, all concentrations must
apply to the Curriculum Committee
for renewal every five years. The
faculty involved with the international
relations concentration have decided
not to apply for renewal, although
students currently enrolled in the concentration will be able to complete
their programs.
Provost Jennie Keith said that students interested in internationalrelations will still be allowed to apply for
a special major.
Rob Hollister, professor of economics, said the concentration was
organized 40 years ago to bring an
international perspective to the study
of economics. Currently, however,
international perspectives are present
in all economics classes, as well as in
courses in related fields such as public policy, making the concentration

obsolete.
The concentration has "become a
list ofcourses," Hollister said. "There
is no cohesive experience like in other
concentrations."
Hollister insisted that the graduate
programs that international relations
students apply to, like the TuftsSchool
ofLaw and Diplomacy, have weakened.
"It would be irresponsible of us to
continue the international relations
concentration when we know it's useless. Days in which International
Relations made a difference are
gone," he said.
Students at the meeting argued that
the concentration needs to be revamped rather than discontinued.
Nancy Benson-Nicol '9B, Student
Council co-coordinator, noted that
the words "international relations"
on a diploma carry more weight with
potential employers than do potential
substitutes such as public policy.
Faculty members felt that if a student has taken courses involving international relations, that is all that
matters. Keith pointed out that
Swarthmore's reputation, and not a
student's major or concentration, is
what matters to employers.
Ayesha Khan '99 argued that while
Swarthmore's name might mean

something in the United States, if a
student is trying to get a job in another country, for example Pakistan,
the employers don't know of
Swarthmore and just look for international relations on the applicant's
diploma.
For this reason, some students
thought that the international relations concentration should be extended for one year to allow current
first-year students to participate.
They also felt that incoming students should be made aware of the
termination of the concentration before they commit to attending the
College.
Keith responded that Swarthmore's
course catalog explains that all
courses are subject to change. Since
the College would like to meet students' expectations, she stressed again
the possibility of a special major and
of taking classes at Haverford and
Bryn Mawr.
"There is such pressure to have
new concentrations. In order to admit
new concentrations we need to get rid
of old ones. There simply is not
enough time or money for everything," Keith said.
Another student questioned
whether it would be difficult to land
an internship without being an international relations concentrator. The
faculty panel again pointed to other
departments for such support, including public policy, which has had students intern at the World Bank.
Darragh Jones '99 worried that the
absence of an International Relations
Concentration would not only affect
job placement after Swarthmore but
also confusion in course selection
now. "I'd like to study International
Relations, but without the structure
of a concentration, there is no directionprovided, and I won't know what
courses to take."
The meeting ended with a lot of
unresolved differences between students and faculty.
Alexander Lundry '99 didn't understand why the College would want
to get rid of a concentration that was
so popular. "Other institutions have
international relations majors and
we're getting rid of amere concentration," he said.
The Curriculum Committee will
meet again in two weeks to consider
the suggestions made by prospective
internationalrelations concentrators.

Hodes Explores Sexual Dynamics
of Nineteenth-Century South
By

Laura Smid

class white women as loose—capable of seducing black men. Even

In honor of Women's History
Month, Martha Hodes, assistant professor of history at New York University, came to Swarthmore Thursday to give her lecture "Sex Across
the Color Line: White Women and
Black Men in the Nineteenth-Century American South." Hodes is the
author of a forthcoming book by the
same title. In her study, Hodes attempts to show that the attitudes of
the southern white establishment towards sexual liaisons between white
women and black men changed from

"silent disapproval" to violence when
slavery was legally abolished at the
end of the civil war.
Before the demise of slavery, Hodes
claims, sex between black men and
white women did not, in itself, pose a
threat to the social system. It was
therefore tolerated; Hodescites many
cases in which neighbors knew about,
but did not denounce such liaisons.
The problem arose whenever some
complication—an alleged rape, a
pregnancy—forced the illicit liaison
into the community's attention. Since
the law stated that a baby's status as

slave or free depended on the status
of the mother, "Mulatto" children
born to white women were free. Sex
between white men and black women
produced more slaves and was, therefore, accepted by those in power. But
to have a baby ofAfrican decentborn
free, did present a challenge to the

system. This is perhaps why a women

might choose to accuse her former
lover of rape when she became pregnant withachildofmixedrace. Hodes
cited many examples.
Hodes pointed out that a black man
was valuable property to a powerful
slave owner, who could use his influence to keep the slave's death sentence from being carried out. Furthermore, society stereotyped lower

in our times, Hodes encountered a
white archivist in Virginia who said

of the white women involved with
black men, "make sure you say
they're trash." Thus the dominant
ideology enabled white plantation
owners to exert control over both
white women and blacks.
When slavery ended white patriarchs no longer had economic motives to protect their slaves. Hodes
says that increased political power
for black men was often linked to
increased fears of whites about their
possible sexual transgression. Ku
Klux Klan testimony to Congress
after the war conflates rights and
property forblack men withthe likelihood of them having illicit sex
with white women, and black leader
Frederick Douglas noted in 1892
that the charge of sexual misconduct
did not fall upon the black maleuntil
he had freedom. It seems that once
racial boundaries were no longer as
strongly sanctioned by the law of
slavery, sexual anxieties about these
boundaries strengthened—black
men were terrorized or murdered
when it was discovered that they
were having sex with white women.

Kohlberg's computers, located on
the ground floor in room 117, provide a new and unique service to
Swarthmore College. They are available for public use between the hours
of 6:00 p.m. and midnight Sunday
through Thursday and from 6:00 p.m.
to 10:00 p.m. on Friday through Saturday. During the day, however, the
space is a classroom where Computer Science, Engineering, Sociology/Anthropology and English departments make use of the computers. Although the computers are still
the same Power Mac, 6116s that used
to be in the Trotter Public Access
space and printing is still done from
Beardsley, changes in use have oc-

curred.
Swarthmore students were alerted
to the move via an all-campus email,
and notices ofthe change were posted
on the _swat.cc.announce and
_swat.cc.employees newsgroups.
Sherri Johnson, the User Services
Coordinator in the Computing Center, reports that "the Kohlberg public
area, from our figures, is getting low
to moderate use" but "consultants
have also been mentioning that the
usage has been picking up these last

finals, the Computing Center "may
be able to extend the hours accordingly". A safewalk has also been provided to see people home after late
hours of computer use, Johnson and
Nussbaum related.
Nussbaumis enthusiastic about the
positive improvements of the
Kohlberg space over the old Trotter
location. He is pleased to have left
Trotter and the dusty chalkboards,
which were dangerous to the computers. The old and insecure windows of the Trotter space were also a
hazard he is glad see removed.
Nussbaum believes that the move has
improved the computer space and
"made them usable"; he described
the physical arrangement of the computers against the walls in Trotter as
difficult for classroom demonstrations and use. Now, he says, Kohlberg
space is "being used constantly for
classes."
Michael Gelman, Social Sciences
Computing Coordinator, explained
the role ofKohlberg' scomputer space
as a classroom where the computers
can be used to "demonstrate software, to let students run simulations
[and to] teach techniques in computer analysis" as applicable to the
Social Sciences and Humanities. The
DuPont classroom, he reports, is already used not only by the Astronomy,
Physics and Math departments, but
the Psychology, Economics and Political Science departments as well.
Gelman has been working "to help
integrate computing into curriculum,"
work he describes as "rewarding".
He described programs used by the

which according to Abraham
Nussbaum '97, the Public Area Lab
Manager for the Computing Center,

sound and a programused by a Social
Sciences class to lay voting records
over a map ofChester. A Sociology/
Anthropology class currently taught
in Kohlberg 117 by Joyce Charlton
uses statistical software to explore
research methods, he explained.
Along with Erik Behrens, Humanities Computing Coordinator and Mary
Hasbrouck, Natural Sciences Computing Coordinator, Gelman holds
workshops, works on faculty projects
and demonstrates programming in
classes to further computer use across
all departments at Swarthmore.
Nussbaum allows that while he feels
that the "campus has become com-

Computing Center. Johnson explained that, "for security reasons,
the lab may not be left open and
unstaffed," so a consultant must be
present during all hours of Kohlberg
Public Area use. Johnson did mention that, depending on use during

puter literate pretty quickly," Swarthmore assumes a certain amount of
computer knowledge, which may
make communication difficult at first.
Gelman describes that the staff of the
Computing Center, is "trying to be

Prospective Admissions Deans
Arrive for Open Interviews
By Abigail

Students are welcome to participate in the selection of a new Dean of
Admissions by attending the open
interviews with current finalists held
in Parrish Parlours.
William Shain, Dean of Admissions at MacalesterCollege, is scheduled to be interviewed at 4:30 p.m. on
April 9. Nancy Meislahn, Director of
Undergraduate Admissions at
Cornell, is scheduled for 4:30 on April
11, Robin Mamlet, Dean of Admissions at the Lawrenceville School,
f0r4:30 on April 23 andßruce Pooch,
Dean of Admissions at Pomona, for
4:30 on April 24.
Dan Oppenheim '96, a student on

the selection committee, explained

how issues of yield and financial aid
rest in the Dean's command. Yield,
the percentage of accepted students
who actually attend Swarthmore, indicates how "desirable" a school is,
Oppenheim said, estimating
Swarthmore's yield at approximately
30 percent. Attention to financial aid
increases yield since college decisions are oftenmade on the basis of a
financial aid package. Oppenheim
explained that a Dean of Admissions
who could easily communicate between financial aid and admissions
offices is essential to Swarthmore.
Students interested in financial aid
and admissions policy should plan to
attend the interviews.

Rabbi Discusses Sex and
Marriage Over Dinner
Patrick Runkle

RabbiHoward Alpert opened a discussion with about 20 students and
several faculty members by saying
that "sex has given religion a bad
name." The Ruach-sponsored dinner
discussion on Jewish perspectives on
sexuality took place Monday night at
Sharpies. He said that many people
believe religion's view of sex is that
it is dirty and ungodly. In actuality,
he said, Judaism celebratesthe phy sicality of humanity and believes that
sex is a beautiful thing.
The Jewish perspective on sexuality must be based entirely on Jewish
traditions, he said, and, making numerous references to Judaic teachings, he described the human relationships in which sex can take place.
In his view, sex in marriage directed
towards the building of intimacy is
the highest form of sexual relations.
The opposite is rape, which is directed towards dehumanization."Dehumanization is sex at its lowest
form," Rabbi Alpert explained.
A large part of the discussion focused on the meaning of marriage
and monogamy. Rabbi Alpert maintained that marriage is a publiclydeclared union that is monogamous,
intimate, emotionally attached, and
set apart from otherrelationships in a
holy way. He used the Hebrew word
kadusha to refer to such a union.
The discussion shifted to the nature of many relationships today,
which is what Rabbi Alpert referred

to as "serial monogamy," in which a
relationship is monogamous and intended to last forever, but it does not,

and the couple breaks apart and moves
on without ever being married. Rabbi
Alpert said that sex in these relationships can be used to create intimacy
and cement the bonds between the
partners, and that, while not being as
perfect as sex within marriage, it still
can be a legitimate form of sexual

expression.
Rabbi Alpert madereference to the
teachings ofMaimonides, a 13th century Judaic scholar, while speaking
of sex within marriage. Maimonides
wrote thatany form of sexual expres-

sion within marriage that is desirous
to the woman is acceptable, even if it
does not lead to procreation. "There-

fore," said Rabbi Alpert, "the legitimacy of sexuality is independent of
procreation."
The participants then broke into
groups of four. Each group was presented with a different sexual scenario to discuss from a Jewish perspective. The scenarios included casual sex, unwanted sexual advances,
and numerous other topics. The group
reformed and each smaller group reported to the whole on its scenario.
This concluded the discussion.
Speaking about the goals of the
discussion, Rabbi Alpert said, "I just
wanted to create a context in which
these issues could be discussed."

Student reaction to the event was
positive, but some feel more of a
discussion is needed.

volvement in the Emily
Bobrow
REMEDY program began when she worked with
William Rosenblatt, MD at the YaleNew Haven Medical Center. She developed educational materials for the
implementation of the program at
other hospitals. She feels that hospitals can only benefit by participating
in the program, as it allows them to
cut down on waste disposal costs for
materials which are never contaminated but which are nevertheless required to be discarded. She also sought
to make hospitals realize that they
were "not going to be running their
sterilization machines more than
usual," because there was often extra
space which could be devoted to resterilizing unused materials. Furthermore, the responsibility for sending
the supplies falls upon local charities, not the hospitals.
During the summer of 1993,
Bobrow convinced Barnes and Jewish hospitals in St. Louis, Missouri to
participate in the program, and the
Christian hospital laterfollowed suit.
She met with officials at many levels
of the hospital, and was surprised that
an operating room nurse was ready to
start the system the next day at 6 a.m.,
very much to Bobrow's surprise. Her
previous advocacy, however, ensured
that the rest of the necessary infrastructure in the hospital had already
been put into place.
The Jewish Hospital set up an agreement with the Jewish Community
Relations Council, which sendsmedical supplies to a Jewish hospital in
Riga, Latvia; Bobrow feels good that
her efforts have benefited people
whose Jewish heritage she shares.
InternationalAid disseminatesBarnes
hospital supplies to such "hot spots"
as Zaire, Somalia, and the former
Yugoslavia. Bobrow notes that while
at first there was only a "little, piddly"
truck to pick up supplies, now there
was a "big, huge one."
After continuing to help REMEDY

contact with doctors on herLatvian

trip, she enjoyed

more personal
contact with a wide variety of people
during her trip to Eritrea during the
summer of 1995. She "wanted to go
to a place where REMEDY supplies
weren't being sent," and took advantage of Cornell Visiting Professor
Asmarom Legesse's contacts within
the country. Sheresearched what supplies were needed in local hospitals

and clinics and the ways in which
they might best be used. She also
sought funding for shipping costs
from such agencies as U.S. Aid, the
World Health Organization, the
United Nations High Commissioner
on Refugees, and UNICEF.
Bobrow also met with the Eritrean
Ministry of Health, which offered to
waive customs taxes and guarantee
the distribution of supplies provided
that there was a constant supply and
that the supplies themselves were in
good condition. The Ministry wondered understandably why Bobrow
was prepared to send them "secondhand things" which the U.S. deemed
inappropriate for use; Bobrow
showed them articles written by Yale
researchers indicating that the materials were indeed safe. Since Bobrow
does not "want to create a dependent
society" unable to function without
these supplies, she insured that the
Eritreans would receive only highquality supplies of which their health
facilities were most in need.
Bobrow has yet to find a supporter
for the shipping of supplies to Eritrea,
although she is still in negotiations
with the Catholic Relief Services.
The U.S. Navy has offered to transport supplies on a humanitarian aid
mission to Eritrea "if they ever have
[extra] space on a ship."
This project has given Bobrow the
desire to go to graduate school, because she has realized that she "may
have altruistic feelings, but not the
knowledge" with which to act upon
them most effectively.

Don't forget what matters most.
As the semester wears on, as dasswork piles up with no end in sight, the
challenge of fulfilling our responsibilities—to friends, to family, to classmates and professors, to the community at large, even to ourselves —becomes
ever greater. We find ourselves spending more and more time in the library
and the computing center, and less and less time doing all the other things that
matter, from sleeping to talking with friends to keeping abreast of current
events.

To putting out a newspaper. With an increasingly busy staff, we find it more
and more difficult to cover even the most important of stories. This may
explain, though it does not excuse, the fact that we haven't sent a reporter to
a Student Council meeting in weeks.
Of course we're not the only students on this campus who are swamped with
work lately. Student Council members, among others, may also be finding it
harder and harder to keep up: for one thing, Council minutes from a meeting
held February 25 were released only on Sunday, March 24. And SAC, which
is now supposed to release minutes every week, has donethat exactly once—for its February 7 meeting.
This apparent lack ofenergy in several major organizations only serves to
highlight the outstanding efforts of several other groups. Pacific Rim Organization has developed into one of the most vital groups on campus, sponsoring frequent lectures and language classes. The Amos J. Peaslee Debate
Society is busy preparing to host the national championships here April 26
through 28. And after a second-place finish at the regional contest in late
February, Swarthmore's College Bowl team has invited students from 14
colleges to a tournament here tomorrow.
There is, of course, more to life than extracurricular activities and academic
work. Many students were initially attracted to Swarthmore by the beauty of
the lawns, the shade of the trees, the serenity of the Crum. So do yourself a
favor: skip a class, or "forget" an important meeting. Go outside. Take
advantage of this campus before you leave for the summer, or forever.

Our love-hate relationship with Sharples.
Every time we think the food in Sharpies has hit rock bottom, the chefs treat
us to a new and exciting dish that we can't get enough of.
And every time we think Sharpies has finally found a way to serve good
food at every meal, these very same chefs serve a meal that should be banished
permanently from the campus.
This week, like every week, was rich with examples. The barbecued
chicken sandwiches at lunch Wednesday were a welcome variation from the
Sharpies routine. Coming after other good lunches this week—including
favorites likeroast beef and pasta bar—the chicken sandwiches convinced us
that Sharpies can serve good food on aregular basis.
Unfortunately, we're dreading this weekend—Sunday night, to be precise.
Past performance is never a guarantee of future results, but based on our
Sharpies experiences every other Sunday night of this semester, the food is
almost certain to be atrocious.
The major dish will be eitherroast turkey or roast pork; it will be served on
both of the main lines, the ones labeled "Garnet Gourmet" (you call this
gourmet?) and "Center Stage" (do us a favor: bring down the curtain).
Whether the centerpiece ofthe meal in rubbery turkey orrubbery pork, there
will also be mashed potatoes and "rosemary" gravy, a concoction not unlike
Elmer's Glue.
If we're lucky, we'll be able to avoid the meat and chow down on dried-out,
recycled stuffed shells. If not, we'll have to stand in a long line at the grill or
the veggie bar—and we may still end up withleftovers that havebeen recycled
one time too many.
Come on, Sharpies. We know you can do it. You keep proving, time and
again, that dining hall food need not nauseate students. But whenever we get
our hopes up, you dash them cruelly. The situation reminds us, slightly, of
Catullus's poem "Odi et Amo." As translated by R.Y. Tyrell, it runs:
I hate yet love: you ask how this is so.
Who knows? But I'm in torment: that I know.

On a related topic, we are pleased to note that in the wake of our editorial
last week, the Kohlberg coffee bar has begun serving hot cocoa. That's cocoa,
not chocolate, for all you purists out there.

Keeping campus debates alive.
The one-month anniversary of the Student Council sit-in and petition to the
Board of Managers is quickly approaching, yet the discussion surrounding
financial aid, socioeconomic diversity, and student representation no longer
occupies center stage. Once again, an important discussion has petered out for
no apparent reason.
Maybe our judgment is premature. Maybe this debate has life in it yet. Just
because issues no longer occupy the realm ofpublic debate does not mean that
they no longer occupy the realm of individuals' minds.
But is there some way for this debate to continue in a productive manner,
without just rehashing old ideas? The swat.talk newsgroup on Newswatcher
serves this function to a certain degree, but the number of students who
participate in those discussions is rather small.
And who needs campus debate if you have computers which make a
discussionwith your UncleElmo justas easy (andperhaps more intellectually
stimulating)? Who needs Parrish Parlors when you have the Internet?
Well, being purveyors oftraditional print media, we feel that there is a place
for continued discussion and debate about a variety of issues, if only to
overcome the possibly negative effects of recurring institutional amnesia.
This is where your the trusty Phoenix becomes as vital as any Internet
discussion group. As you may or may not have noticed, we have been trying
to make the editorial pages less a showcase for our own polemical skills, and
more a space for the rest of the community to debate whatever it feels is
worthy of discussion. In this way, the newspaper becomes something more
than merely the means by which a few crazy students keep themselves up on
Thursday nights. We invite you to join in.
The Phoenix is published weekly, except during examination and vacation periods, by the
students of Swarthmore College. Community submissions are welcome; please contact the
appropriate section editor before submitting anything other than a letter to the editors. The

American

foreign policy ever
since Bill Clinton became
president has not been renowned for its consistency and moral
certitude. From the debate surrounding re-granting China Most Favored
Nation (MFN) status to whether to
impose sanctions on Nigeria's murderous military dictatorship, Clinton
and his advisers have never been seen
to take a firm policy position. Rather
they have, it appears, taken to new
heights, the maxim that in foreign
policy, there are no friends, only interests. While Clinton's policy
smacks of Kissingeresque realism, it
can be understood withthe context of
the competing interests that increasingly inform policy directions in this
country. These competing interests
such as minority groups and corporations have been having a field day of
late. They rose to power years ago,
but they have never ruled America's
foreign policy as viciously as in the
case of the Nigerian Question.
Nigeria, after gaining its independence in 1960, was ruled by a succession of high handed military officers
except for a briefcivilian interregnum
from 1960 to 1966,and from 1979 to
1983. The military, particularly because of its promise to solve the
nation's developmental problems
(e.g. corrosive public corruption), has
been largely tolerated. Of late, however, civilian demands that the military leaders leave office permanently
have been largely ignored. Ruling
Nigeria is, apparently, rather profitable for generations of military offic-

ers. Endowed with one of the world's
largest oil and natural gas reserves,
Nigeria exports about $9-$ 15 billion
of oil annually. Little of this money
ever reaches the people either in the
form of better schools, sophisticated
health delivery systems or better communications infrastructure. Calculations by Nigerian economists, verified by the International Monetary
Fund, indicate that at least 20 percent
of the country's oil revenue is diverted into private bank accounts scattered all across North America, Europe and increasingly Asia. The
money is then used to buy up real
estate, golf courses, American Treasury bills, hotel chains, car
dealerships, shipping lines, or shares
in major global companies. If something is deemed worthy of investment, chances are Nigerian money,
illegally pilfered from the people,
will be involved.
It seems clear that Nigeria is run by
a sophisticated clan ofcriminals who
will stop at nothing to protect the
forest from which they harvest timber to build theirdream log cabins. In
November 1995, the generals, led by
Infantry General, Sani Abacha,
moved to liquidate a group ofminority rights activists it deemed dangerous to their self-aggrandizing and
enrichment efforts. These activists,
hanged on November 10 included
world famous writerKen Saro Wiwa
who, before his death, proclaimed
that the struggle shall continue regardless of the military's repressive
tactics. Characteristically, the international community led by South
African president Nelson Mandela

Lkttkrs to

and Zimbabwean president Robert
Mugabe, calledfor sanctions designed
to cripple the military government's
ability to torture its people. Characteristically, many speeches were
made, and many articles written. Every imaginable foreign policy gimmick designed to jerk tears was deployed. Collectively, the world proclaimed how nasty the generals in
Abuja were and vowed to deal decisively with them.
Today, in March 1996, has anything changed? General Sani Abacha
is even more firmly in control than he
was in November of 1995. American
and European oil firms such as Shell,
Mobil, Texaco, Agip, Chevron, and
Elf-Aquitane are happily pumping
out the"black gold" that powers many
Western economies—l 4 percent of
the gasoline America uses daily
comes from Nigeria. American and
European business executives point
to Nigeria's undervalued stock market as the new frontier for the future,
claiming that the business interests
that market represents are too important to pass up. Daily, trade delegations are flowing in discussing one
deal after the other, talking about
joint partnerships in oil exploration,
gas production and distribution, vehicle production, high speed telecommunication networks and light manufacturing. Chinese engineers and
bankers from China's equivalent of
the American Ex-Im Bank recently
just financed a $560 million deal to
rebuild Nigeria's railways. This is
not just business as usual; this is an

developed. Since Nov. 1995, no week
or so has passed without another
American delegation departing or
returning from Nigeria on a fact-finding tour. These tours, some sponsored by Abuja or Abuja's business
allies, on their return, tend to note
that yes, there is a need for democracy, but the generals are just doing
such fine work that there is no need to
rush things. Nigerians, denied the
right to rule themselves since December 1983, can afford to wait till
October 1998. A few more years of
repression don' t matter, do they ? The
fact-finders do occasionally admitthat
the thieving pack needs to be open
with its populace. It has never ceased
to amaze Nigeria's democratic opposition how these groups, one after the
other, have failed to see the massive
political repression thatgoes on. Also,
they tend to fail to notice the fact that
hundreds of journalists, human rights
activists, and other political dissidents are languishing in jail.
What particularly irks the democratic opposition is the fact that these
fact finding groups have in majority
been composed of African-Americans. The most colorful of these fact
finders is Louis Farrakhan of the
NationofIslam. Others have included
clergy men, journalists from the
Washington Times and Detroit Free
Press, and representatives of many
black communities in America.
Rather than see the blatant ruthlessness of the military junta,they tend to
spend time criticizing the West for its
supposed neocolonialist intervention

conflict.

Response to Frank Amar: Don't perpetuate stereotypes about the Palestinian-Israeli
To the editor:
I was surprised and dismayed to
find the level of gross stereotyping
and, for lack of a better phrase, hack
journalism present in Mr. Amar's
article last week, "NeedWe Stand for
the Flag?" Though I can understand
and respect his position on the
Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf controversy,
I must take exception to two points
which he raised.
First, Mr. Amar uses the old nationalistic slogan, "Dude, love it or
leave it," to summarize his beliefs on
the issue. Is Mr. Amar suggesting we
blindly follow a government without
thought to what it's doing? Am I to
assume thatMr. Amar disapproves of
civil disobedience? I would like to
hear his opinions on the civil rights
Movement and theVietnam War protests of the '6os and '7os. In addition,
I would like to hear Mr. Amar's wellthought-out definition of what it
means to be "un-American".
But this is not about the American

flag; it is about irresponsible journalism and the perpetuation of stereotypes. Mr. Amar writes, "Abdul-Rauf
could...find a home in the Middle
East with... Islamic demagogues who
demonize the United States...he
could find employment with those

whack jobs in Hamas or the PLO as a
suicide bomber." I wonder whether
Mr. Amar realizes the irony in this
statement; not only does his lack of
knowledge allow him to demonize
Muslims, but it also prevents him
from understanding the complicated
history of this region.
I remember listening to Edward
Said, outspoken Palestinian-Ameri-

Palestinian civilians are killed daily
by the Israeli military. During what
Israelis call their War for Independence in 1948, two-thirds of the Palestinian population was dispossessed
and put out of Palestine, both Muslims and Christians. Today, the number of refugees has grown to 3 to 3.5
million people throughout theMiddle
East, from Egypt to Syria. These do

can professor of English at Columbia
University and former advisor to

include the Palestinian population now in the West Bank and Gaza,
which were conquered in the 1967
not

Yasser Arafat, talk about the realities
of the Israeli-Palestinian struggles
from the perspective ofa Palestinian.
Said described the squalor and violence in the occupied lands. For example, he called Gaza, one of the
most densely populated areas in the
world, "a hell on earth", where the
economy is in ruins and basic natural

Geneva Convention. Said noted that
in 1982, when Israel was in charge of
indiscriminate bombing of Palestinian refugee camps, hospitals, and orphanages, killing 20,000 civilians,
the American press did little to con-

resources, such as water, are extremely scarce. Homes of arrested
Palestinians are razed by antitank
missiles. On average, two to three

tinually turned its back on the human
rights violations perpetrated by Israel; in fact, Israel has been the larg-

war and are even now occupied by
Israeli settlers, in defiance of the

demn it. The United States has con-

aid, receiving a total of $BO billion
over the past 25-30 years and recently, approximately $5 billion per

year.

Saidargued thatBaruch Goldstein,
the man who killed dozens of civilians while they were praying, was a
product of both Zionism and American culture's animosity and intolerance towards non-Western ideas and
peoples. Goldstein was a follower of
the radical, Rabbi Meir Kahane, who
openly advocated the killing of Arabs. Ten days after the massacre at
Hebron, 3 3 more civilians were killed.
Mr. Amar would like us to believe
that we live in a world in which exists
a clear-cut dichotomy between freedom-loving, democratic Israel and
evil, totalitarian, and terrorist Arabs.
In reality, the history of the IsraeliPalestinian conflict is much more
complicated than Mr. Amar's simpleminded version. If Mr. Amar truly
believes in the notion of justice, he
would stop for a moment and try to
understand both perspectives in the
conflict. History is not a cartoon plot
nor is it modeled after "True Lies".
"Dude"? "Whack"? We are no longer
in high school, Mr. Amar.

Response to Brian Schwartz: Maybe "NINACOW!" isn't really the solution to the welfare crisis.
To the editor:
My congratulations go outto Brian
Schwartz, who in his opinion piece
last week successfully justified the
suffering of the poor and disenfranchised while the wealthy and powerful profit at their expense with one
simple acronym: "NINACOW!" One
can see the uses for this catchy phrase
in all walks of life. Perhaps New
York governor George Pataki could
rally the support ofwelfare recipients
behind his plan to cut their benefits
(which already do not meet the poverty line) by sending them all a shiny
poster with those seven letters printed
on it; closer to home, I'm sure Laura
Talbot could have some fun with a
few financial aid applicants by sending them their applications back with
"NINACOW!" stamped on it.
As our economy faces corporate
down-sizing and social safety net cutbacks, "NINACOW!" might be the
solution to all our problems of worker
discontentment. When a worker at a
large corporation complains that she
is being laid off while the CEO makes
a multimillion dollar bonus and the
stockholders enjoy record profits, we
need only remind her that
"NINACOW!" Does shedare to claim
that she should enjoy unemployment
benefits to support her in-between
jobs? "NINACOW!" Support for retraining to find ajob? "NINACOW!"
School lunches to help feed her children while she faces zero-cash flow?
"NINA..." Well, you get the idea. (Of
course, maybe hungry children need
only follow Mr. Schwartz's advice
and "approach people, hat in hand,
and show how [their] goals are worthwhile to pursue.")
Of course, this woman should be

able to go to a private charity, which
Mr. Schwartz, like all sane adults I
know, supports. One may wonder,
however, what sort of motivation to
give people might have in a society
that lives by the motto that there is no
inherent right of anybody to survive
(obviously implied in a theory that
denies the right to a living wage or
decent health care). Should those
wage-earners who earn enough to
support their families, and have some
left over after taxes, funnel enough of
that money back into private charity
so that all people receive the tools
they need to have a fighting chance in
life? It is highly questionable. Not
only do they live in a society that
denies the rationale that all people
deserve a fighting chance, but the
amount spent on social programs that
they might receive back still will not
achieve that goal, unless private charity finds a way to help people out of
poverty more cost-efficiently than has
ever been done. One need simply
examine the history ofAmerican poor
to see how well the private market of
individual rights has treated them
(would Mr. Schwartz prefer to work
in a factory 100 years ago without
unionization and governmental safety
standards, or a modern one?).
What Mr. Schwartz does not mention is that if "NINACOW!" exists,
so must also GIACOW: Greed is a
claim on wealth! For if "the freedom
to think manifests itself in the freedom to pursue and create values"
(silly me, I always agreed with John
Stuart Mill that thefreedom ofthought
manifests itself in freedom of speech,
not in paying an employee an inadequate wage), then we wouldbe placing a limit on that freedom if we put

any limit on anybody' s ability to take
wealth (I use the word "take" and not
"earn," as Mr. Schwartz prefers, because not all wealth is earned; ask
Steve Forbes), no matter if that person is already rich beyond beliefand
the person whowould otherwise have
gotten that money is raising a family
in poverty. Clearly, industrial workers who clamored for governmental
standards for safety in the workplace
were full of it, because their need for
a safe working environment does not
justify forcing the factory owner to
pay for improvements, since he has
the right to be as greedy as he chooses
to be. The workers could ask the
factory owner to voluntarily improve
conditions, but their words would
have no bite because, of course,
unions are anti-individual rights.
Mr. Schwartz is claiming that a
right to keep every penny we obtain
by whatever means possible is deserving to be in the Bill of Rights,
outside the purview of democratic
control which brought us the govern-

mental safety net and, albeit with
some desires to lessen its scope, still
supports its existence today. Turning
all of these responsibilities over to
private charities is certainly appealing, but the history ofAmerican workers and poor shows us that the private
marketis incapable of addressing their
needs. To deny these people access to
a decent wage, food, shelter, and
health care is to deny them the right to
pursue the freedom of property rights
Mr. Schwartz holds so dear. While
the rich rationalize by GIACOW their
right to accumulate and accumulate
way beyond their need, the poor face
a complex economic system that cannot be entered into without investment capital, health, and a quality
education (all of which takemoney to
obtain). Faced with this reality, do
the poor and disenfranchised have a
claim on the wealth of those who
have more than they could ever need?
I have just one short answer to that:
NIACOW!

The extended community: Swatties on NPR.
Fellow Swatties:
How many of us have been asked,
"Where do you go to school?", followed by, "I've never heard of it,
where is it?" Well, if the Republican
Congress doesn't destroy NPR, we
have a chance of emerging out of
obscurity yet. I was driving in The
Middle of Nowhere, South Carolina,
on my way to Jacksonville, Florida
after stopping by Swat, when "All
Things Considered" came on. I was
delightfully surprised to hear a story
by "Charlie Mayer, a sophomore at

Swarthmore College in Swarthmore,
PA" on our Rhythmic Analysis class.
Charlie's description of March at
Swat was right on, and so was the
drumming. How do you describe it?
Something about hearing a story on
drumming on NPR while in The
Middle of Nowhere, SC would still
have had a Swarthmore feel even if
the story weren't actually about Swat.
Enjoy the workload, see you inMay.

Should Art Get State Support? Hidden Meanings: Abstract Expression and Slide Rock

Don't force taxpayers to support objectionable art.

Neena Shenai

When

Jane Alexander, the president
of the National Endowment for the
Arts, testified before the House Appropriations Committee on March 13, she
insisted that America's children would be
deprived of art and culture if funding for her
organization were cut. However, she and the
NEA did not mention that certain artists who
are given NEA grants use the money to create
art unsuitable for children. The young people
of the U.S. need not be exposed to obscene
and sexually explicit art to be educated.
It seems clear that the NEA has a liberal
bias; it sponsors some art that no one should
be funding, let alone the government. As
taxpayers, we should not have to pay for the
"frills" of other citizens. If they wish to fund
obscene art, they can do so privately. We
cannot trust the NEA with taxpayer money;
its programs are expensive luxuries.
The NEA claims protection under the First
Amendment of the Constitution; it claims
that "freedom of speech" means that it is
appropriate for the government to fund any
type of art. However, underMiller v. California in 1973, the Supreme Court ruled that
something is obscene if it contains offensive
sexual messages and if, according to the
particular state law, it lacks serious literary
and artistic value. Obviously, the judgment
about what is acceptable is subjective. But
funding vulgar or sexually explicit art clashes

with the values of our culture.
Jane Alexander also mentioned that the
NEA has an Office of Enterprise development which raises money for nonprofit art. If
there is a particular office that has this job
already, why can't it be used to gather funds
for all NEA-sponsored art?This organization
must understand that it cannot have the funding it once received in a time of massive
spending cuts. We can compare the NEA to a
company in which the American people are
shareholders. Shareholders influence company decisions; we should all have a say in
the decision on the NEA's grant recipients.
The government certainly has the right to
set a standard for what type of art the NEA
funds. The NEA itselfmakes aesthetic judgements when giving grants to artists. Since the
organization is funded with taxpayer money,
and since the NEA is selective in its grants,
Americans shouldhave a say in what types of
art can be displayed in public.
The Republican Congress has rightfully
decreed a 10 percent cut in the NEA budget
over the next five years. Congress gives the
same sorts ofreasons for the cuts. Only essential organizations shouldreceive government
funds. Not only is the essential nature of the
NEA questionable, but it also funds material
of dubious artistic value. The organization
eventually should be taken off the government payroll. This will allow the NEA to
sponsor any kind of art it pleases without
forcing people to pay for indecent material.

COUNTERPOINT
Privatizing all art would be detrimental to expression.
By Aaron Bartley

We

live in an age ofrationality. Modes
of production have been perfected
to such an extent that humans are
scarcely needed in the manufacturing process. Wall Street beckons and the megacorporations respond by laying off workers
by the thousands. The forces of the market

seem to have swallowed whole the entire
political dialogue within the United States.
The Gingrich revolutionaries, for their part,
have done their best to portray the market as
the true source of freedom and as the natural
mechanism of human interaction. But does
an absolute faith in the market allow us to
achieve our full potential as human beings?
Does the market care for the soul ofAmerica?
I argue that the trend towards privatization
and deregulation is buttressed by an ideology
that has a very limited conception of what it
means to develop as a human being. This
outlook is exemplified by the movement to
scale back or eliminate altogether the National Endowment for the Arts.
Performing and creative arts centers in the
United States are vital, both in themselves
and for the purposes they serve. The many
arts organizations that rely on the NEA allow
performers to realize their human potential
for beauty and expression. NEA-funded organizations permit the greater public to appreciate this potential in person. By participating in the creative process, either as artist
or viewer, we celebrate our unique capacities
for expressing emotion and reasoning.
The arts can also help create a greater sense
of national community. The cultural history
of the U.S demonstrates that the most poignant and powerful forms of expression are
often developed by those who have been
disenfranchised or otherwise shut out. Thus,
artistic expression fills a void for those in
America whose voices have been systematically silenced. The arts, as the pillar of our
culture, are crucial for determining how we,
as Americans, understand and relate to one
another. They enable us to define in clearer
terms what it means to be an American.
What's left to be shown is why the government has any role to play in aiding the process
of artistic creation. But, I ask, why not?
According to a view currently prevailing in
Washington, government should limit itself
to strengthening the forces of the market. The
implicit claim is thatAmericans have no need
for a framework which encourages greater
social interaction and responsibility. To this,
I say that without a method ofrelating to one
another, we reject the possibility of ever
living in a functional moral community. Our
resident objectivist would chime in that we
have no responsibility but to ourselves. He
fails to recognize that the market is itself a
human construct and that human freedom is
far more likely to result in a community
which acknowledges the possibility of exploitation and seeks to ensure fairness.
An objection has often been raised that
NEA-funded organizations are "elitist." This
is preposterous. The overwhelming majority
of NEA grants go to groups which operate
day in and day out in the communities of the
United States. These are regional art museums, orchestras and dance troupes which
make a commitment to serving a particular
community through educational initiatives
and performances. Far more divisive is a
market system which elevates a few marquee
performers while excluding all of the rest.

These superstars have no strong ties to anyone—and, in fact, often become completely
removed from real world conditions.
The market is incapable of nurturing true
artistic expression. The profit motive inhibits
and distorts the freedom which is so essential
for creation. While artistic endeavors are
rarely undertaken without some consideration of who will come to see them, the
uninhibited drive for profit is incompatible
with the objectives and methods of artistic
expression. We already have a market for art.
It produces timeless classics such as
Braveheart and promotes the impressive acting talents of Keanu Reeves. The American
culture entrepreneurs are isolated in exclusive Southern California communities, and
their industry has become so concentrated
that some have dubbed it the "CultureTrust."
Underlying this discussion are two contrasting views ofhuman nature and the meaning of life. I view artistic expression as an
integral human activity and as one which can
foster dialogue and a sense of community.
One who argues for the privatization of all
artistic activities rejects the importance of
building a cohesive and open community
based on common values and principles.

The

celebrity status ofKohlberg amongst
the architectural features of this campus remains undisputed. It has the
double benefit of both costing obscene
amounts of money and being the subject of
what passes for controversy in our quaint
community. I am pleased that Kohlberg has
introduced what I consider to be a higher
awareness of the architecture of the campus
and its "greater" meaning; I fear, however,
that Kohlberg in its superstardom may have
diverted attention from other worthy sites of
interest. It is in an effort to rectify this diversion ofinterest that I am writing this article.
I now draw the reader's attention to whatis
arguably one of the least interesting areas of
this campus: the awkward, vaguely square,
field nestled between Hicks, Papazian,
Beardsley, Trotter, and Pearson. Not lucky
enough to be gifted with the stark natural
beauty of the Crum, the serene grandeur of
Parrish, the high-tech glitz of the LP AC, the
seductive (alleged and mythical) hedonism
of PPR, the communal coziness ofTarble, or
the sheer utility ofMcCabe and Sharpies, this
small space is second only to Willets in being
despised and even lacks Willets' sense of
indignity to make it interesting. Why, then,
would any writerrisk writing about this heretofore uninspiring patch of earth?
Before answering the question I shall redirect the reader's attention to the appropriate-

ness of this patch's frank existence. It is
surrounded by buildings that are dedicated to
the advancement of certain important disciplines: engineering, political science, computer science and religion. Further away, on
the other side of Beardsley and in Papazian
reside psychology and art. For a liberal arts
campus this is an unusually scientific assemblage of disciplines, and it is appropriate that
the area overlooked by their windows should

In the corner of this strange space lies slide

observe this striking piece of art: it is composed of large metallic girders bentinto slides

Having spent a great deal of time in these

but not unexpected. Who is to say what our

Conservatism and the '50s: Still Merit in Traditional Values
By

Decrying

Chuck Stevens

the evils of the present and
evoking images ofhappy bygone days
is an ancient political gambit; all we
need, it seems, is for memories of the actual
time in question to fade a bit. The logical end
of boy-things-were-good-then campaigns, it
seems to your columnist, should be a proposal to develop time travel; thatwould probably be more realistic than attempting to hold
the supposedly halcyon age over again. But,
while your columnist reserves a measure of
scorn for unqualified nostalgia as a political
slogan, he is troubled by the notion that
appealing to aspects of times past is inherently silly; if an ideal to which we might want
to aspire is reflected by a past era, it seems
only sensible to appeal to a model.
Wendy Lawrence's article in the March 22
Phoenix denounces the tendency, in vogue
recently among Republicans, to appeal to the
50s as a "glorious, idealizeddecade" wherein
good old-fashioned values prevailed," and
if Ms. Lawrence has in mind specific speeches
that extol the entire decade as good, venerable, your columnist agrees. But the pattern
by which most conservative speakers invoke
the past is a tad more adroit: the usual way is
to talk about specific aspects of the '9os that
bug the speaker and to look back at the past,
when things, in that specific respect, were
different. More often than not, moreover,
those "things" refer in some way to the "new
standard of morals" (old, actually) and "religious influences" that Ms. Lawrence resists;
the high divorce rate and teen promiscuity are
two favorite examples—and criticizing those
ideas as wrong or misguided constitutes a
strange sort of apology for the '9os.
Does Ms. Lawrence genuinely think that,
say, increased teen sexual activity is not a
problem, and that referring to the 'sos as a
better time in that particular way represents
"overturning years of progress?" Does she
genuinely believe that referring to the virtues
of a past decade is wrong in itself? Does she
'

"

understand the mindset that insists that PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY (as in, teens
deciding not to have sex) is the best way to
change that—and is troubled by how rarely
that particular phrase comes up when liberals
talk about social change? Evidently not.
What conservatives find troubling about
the '9os is not solely sociological trends, but
the reluctance on the left to condemn those
trends—on grounds that it would constitute
imposing one's values or some such thing.
Your columnist, call him a Neanderthal if
you like, finds the vision of values that limits
theirrelevance to oneself somewhat wimpy:
if there are no values with broad application
(across people, across situations), there can
be no such thing as moral instruction—and
hence no ground for saying that things like,
sexism, racism and the like are wrong in
themselves. More importantly, as one's values are generally directly relevant to how one
governs or votes on legislation, demanding
that everyone shut up about that values stuff
seems a smidge confused, and a candidate
who states that he believes that certain values
are right but that his political behavior would
not reflect those values sounds like one morally tangled candidate.
One can legitimately object that pontificating about morality in political speeches is an
ineffective tool for moral improvement of
society; your columnist agrees that political
campaigns (Bush in '92 comes to mind) that
try to define themselves around an "everyone-should-be-more-moral" message strike
him as irrelevant. But the ideas about morality proposed by, say, Republican presidential
candidates usually have some policy backbone to them: Pat Buchanan, if elected, will
not merely try to end abortion by talking
about it. All political candidates have some
sort of values; the electoral process chooses
one set over another.
It is not entirely clear whether Ms.
Lawrence's objection is to the idea of asserting that a set of values should hold for all, or
simply to this particular set of values—but it

seems that much of what she criticizes has
little, on the whole, to do with those values. In
apparent contrast to the 'sos, "groups that in
the past couldn't speak above a whisper are
shouting their messages from sea to shining
sea"—an eminently laudable concept that
doesn't have much to do with the idea that
teens should avoid sex and people should
practice monogamy. That there was racial
prejudice in the 'sos is undeniable; that it had
anything to do with the values conservatives
generally extol these days is much less clear.
Nor is it clear why the decade's negative
aspects should invalidate the good; there is
no reason why, in hailing a low illegitimacy
rate from 1955, a politician must defend
school segregation as well—and the common tactic, again, is not praise of a decade as
a whole, but praise of something about it.
Your columnist was, admittedly, a bit confused by Ms. Lawrence's argument: she attacks the appeal to "conservative values", but
then proceeds to suggest thatthe movement is
grounded in fear that whites, heterosexuals,
and Christians are losing their power, which
isn't quite the same as conservative values,
despite what we liberals (oh, hush, your columnist is a liberal in thereal world) might like
to think. Ms. Lawrence refers to this subset of
the population as the "just generally 'morally
good' majority," a puzzling phrase that seems

to imply that someone, somewhere, has referred to white heterosexual Christians as
inherently "morally good," a crass statement
if true but more likely rhetorical excess on
Ms. Lawrence's part. The basis of the claim
that clinging to conservative values indicates
a fear of diminished power is simply unsubstantiated; why, your columnist wonders, do
campaigns against, say, smut on TV actually
indicate fear of minority groups?
The point to all this is that Ms. Lawrence
might want to consider what is really at stake
in the dispute over values. A sociological
trend toward more diversity does not mean
that conservative values are irrelevant, nor
does it mean thatthosevalues somehow stand
for what conditions were like in a more conservative age. Your columnist has not heard
about the conservative argument that there
are too many women and minorities in positions of power; do fill him in.
There were many things wrong with the
'sos, apathy and racial hatred among them.
There are also many things wrong with the
'9os, apathy and racial hatred once again
among them, and using the salvageable aspects of the 'sos as a model for change can be
useful. If nostalgia becomes an end in itself;
that's a problem—but Ms. Lawrence fails to
show that the values she criticizes are no
longer applicable.

Seventh Principle Dance Company Displayed Incredible Spirit and Talent
By

Mandara Meyers

I

have to admit it. If I hadn'tbeen scheduled as an usher
for the Seventh Principle Performance Company's
concert on Friday night, I probably wouldn't have
gone. Fortunately enough, I was.
The performance was incredible. The company, founded
in 1992, is a contemporary African-American performing group that explores dance and culture through performance and research. Their choreography combines the
Umfundalai technique, traditional African dance, modern and contemporary styles such as hip-hop. The cast
bills its work as "holistic approaches to performance,"
using visual arts, theatre, music, and vocal talents.
The troupe's name, "The Seventh Principle," comes
from their mentor, Dr. Kariamu Welsh-Asante. The idea
of the seventh principle is part of the African-American
celebration, Kwanzaa, which promotes community and

cultural solidarity. Kwanzaa is based oi
seven principles; the seventh is imani, or
faith. The program explains that Dr.
Welsh-Asante knew that "it would be by
faith alone that we would succeed; faith in
ourselves and our ancestors, elders, and mentors."
They have succeeded. Whether it can be attributed i
to their faith, spirit, passion, or talent, the Seventh
Principle Performance Company has found the key
Friday night's performance was an amazing combination of dance, music, singing, and theatre that
was both inspirational and empowering.
The works ranged from contemporary
pieces—like the opening work, "On the Edge,"
which used the music of Roy Ayers and Scarface —to tne
finale, "Soli Celebration," which is a traditional West
African dance from the Ivory Coast and Guinea. One of
the pieces, "Fishin' 4 R'ligion" was a personal mono-

logue written and performed by one of the

lancers. In both their movements and their
words, the performers showed incredible
compassion, creativity, humorand poignancy
that permeated sharply through the audience.
Several of the cast members are natives of the
Philadelphia area, including nearby Chester, and
four are still in college. Already, these talented
performers have worked with companies like Alvin
Ailey and the DanceTheatre ofHarlem —two of the
most renowned primarily African-American dance
companies in the nation.
Although the dancing was outstanding, the music
powerful, and the vocal performances enlightening, the
most amazing part of the evening was the performers
themselves. Even after the concert itself was over, the
dancers and music continued, with a spirit that seemed
unstoppable. Forming a semicircle, the cast members

'

'

stepped out one at a time and gave the audience one more
exhibition of their prowess. Smiling and gesturing, the
rest of the performers watched eagerly as the soloists
performed feats, each more miraculous than the last.
Rather than for the audience, theseperformances seemed
to be personal celebrations—in being young, in being
talented, in being strong, both physically and emotionally, and in being black.
By the time the house lights went up and the stage lights
went down, audience members filled the stage along with
the dancers. Children sat in a circle at the edge while a
dancers led them in arm movements. Students danced
alongside the performers; adults from the audience leapt
onstage and formed their own circles of movement.
For all of you who, like my friends, keep saying, "Oh,
I really wanted to see that, but I had work," every time I
begin raving about the performance, what can I say? If
you missed it, you missed out.

A Theme Weekend of Wicked Women Killers
By

Jonathan Evans
Jessica Keith

and

Jessica: Last weekend we had a man
licensed to kill, so this weekend we have
women who kill without remorse.
Jonathan: Those whacky Movie Committee folk. Bloodthirsty lot. I'm amazed
they didn't get "Braveheart" for this
year...Good movie, butbest director/picture?
Would've preferred they'd
gone with the talking pig.
Sorry, not the timefor Oscar
critique.
Jessica:

Even though
these women aren't the most
stable people I've seen, I enjoy seeing these strong female lead roles. Especially
in two movies that are as
well-made as these.
Jonathan: Yes, Ms.
Keith, you are correct. I am
totally psyched up for these
two flicks. Malicious women
killing men just makes my
Swattie blood pump.
Jessica: Speaking of
blood, this week's first
movie, Luc Besson's "La
Femme Nikita," has plenty
of it. That's what you get
when you make a movie
about a drug addict/ murderer turned professional assassin. The catch in "La Femme Nikita" is, of
course, that this killer is a woman. This makes
for an interestingplot, as it combinesboth the
story of training an assassin with, believe it or
not, a Pygmalion/"My Fair Lady" story of
bringing the true femininity out of a cold
street girl. And this is just part of the plot.
If you've seen "Point of No Return," the
1993 U.S. remake of "La Femme Nikita"
starring Bridget Fonda, then you'll probably
recognize the story—and then some. "Point
of No Return" copies at least the first twothirds of "La Femme Nikita" extremely
closely, right down to the sets and even camera angles at times.
Still, the remake can't touch the original,
and I urge you to go see "La Femme Nikita"
even if you've already see the other, and
especially if you liked it.
The plot of "La Femme Nikita" is this:
Nikita (Anne Parillaud) is a ruthless drug
~...

.

addict and thief who is sentenced to life in
prison after murdering a cop in a botched
robbery. Instead of going to jail, however,
she is sequestered by the French National
Intelligence Agency, who give her the choice
of either joining them or dying.
She is placed under the supervision ofBob
(Tcheky Karyo), whose job is to train her as
the perfect deadly assassin. She at first resists, but given no real choice she soon gives
in and is taught to shoot,
fight (although she can already dothese pretty well)
and, most of all, act and
dress like a true French
lady.
Three years later, they
release her, tell her to reintegrate herself into society and be ready for a mission as soon as she hears
her code name, Josephine.
On the outside, Nikita is
faced with a new set of
problems as she has to balance the rather stressful
life of a secret assassin
with her daily relationship
with her new fiance. Then
Nikita's assigned to coordinate one very dangerous
important mission, and
well, things start going
crazy. You'll see.
Okay, so it's not the
. »i v
;f
most realistic plot in the world and the actual
role of the intelligence agency is pretty ridiculous if you think of it. The beauty of this
movie is the character of Nikita, acted beautifully by Parrilaud. Unlike "Point of No
Return," which in typical Hollywood fashion
must have a hero/heroine, Nikita is not portrayed as a heroine, or even really that likable.
At times we can feel a little sorry that she's in
such a tough situation, but it's also so clearly
her fault, and she shows so little remorse until
the end.
Nikita is a fierce, strong, complex character, who I really liked seeing develop. Add
this to the overall excitement of the movie,
and it's a thoroughly enjoyable film. If you
like action and well-done movies and don't
mind some violence and subtitles (now really, they're not a big deal), then definitely go
see this one.
Jonathan: Oooh. Violence and subtitles.
~-••.,:

i

>;-

How can you go wrong? Sounds like a good
Jackie Chan movie...but they'd probably be
dubbed. Anyway...
Okay, a movie starring Nicole Kidman?
Why the hell would you want to go to that,
besides her sex appeal? Because this is a
GOOD MOVIE.
"To Die For" is as black a comedy as they
come, based on the true story of the teacher
seducing her student to kill her husband.
Change teacher to weather forecaster and you
have the plot summed up right there. Add the
style of Gus Van Sant Jr. (also the director of
"My Own Private Idaho," "Even Cowgirls
Get the Blues," and "Drugstore Cowboy")
and you have a movie that's a definite mustsee-TV-Thursday type.
There are just so many different aspects of
this movie that make it worth seeing: music
by Danny Elfman ("Batman," "The
Simpsons," "Edward Scissorhands"), Matt
Dillon's exceptional performance, River
Phoenix's brother Joaquin Phoenix, and the
true star of this movie—Nicole Kidman.
Suzanne Stone Maretto, Nicole Kidman's
character, is a person with absolutely no
redeeming qualities except that she's apparently good in bed. Well, if you have to be
manipulated by someone, might as well be in
that way. But anyway, Nicole Kidman truly
does a remarkable job. She has some incredible lines, like, "It's nice to live in a country
where life, liberty, and other stuff, stand for
something."
This movie has one ofthe most remarkable
scenes in my recent memory when Suzanne
has to face the press, and the white lights of
the cameras become the white lights ofheaven.
The woman that plays Matt Dillon's
character's sister is just another awesome
character...
Basically, this movie rocks the house
You're in a cynical mood, you're in a mood
to see a good movie...whatever. See this. It
will surprise you and put a sinister smile on
your face.
Jessica: Sounds like agood way to start off
the infamous Sager party. Saturday's going
to be a great night.
Jonathan: You betcha. Already got my
fishnets ready to be worn.
Jessica: Yes, I want them back when

There

lan Bricke

are two Spike Lees. The first, the
famous one, is angry, polemical, and
tightly focused. The second is laidback, romantic, and self-indulgent. Spike #1
has made two of the most important American movies of the last decade—"Dothe Right
Thing" and "Malcolm X"—as well as the
powerful, albeit flawed, "Jungle Fever" and
"Clockers." Spike #2 followed up his debut,
"She's Gotta Have It," with "School Daze,"
"Mo' Better Blues," and "Crooklyn."
It's the tensions between the two Spikes,
the constant blurring of the boundaries between the politics of Spike #1 and the sunshine of Spike #2, that make Lee one of the
most consistently interesting directors working in and around Hollywood today.
Unfortunately, the new film from Spike #2,
"Girl 6," is anything but interesting. Billed as
an outrageous comedy, it's anything but
funny. Played as a goofy romance, it's anything but romantic. Intended as a sweet-natured valentine to the struggling-actressturned-phone- sex-worker of its title, it's too
damn disjointed to provoke anything but bewilderment. It's as if the collected works of
Spike #2 were thrown into a Cuisenaire,
pulverized into a gloppy mess, and allowed to
congeal. The final product has to be among
the longest two hours I've ever spent staring
at a movie screen.
It's obvious that "Girl 6," like "Crooklyn"
before it, is very much Spike Lee' s pet project.
The screenplay, written by Suzan-Lori Parks,
is pretty rudimentary. Despairing of ever
getting a decent acting job and running low
on rent money, Girl 6 (Theresa Randle) takes
a position with an upscale phone-sex firm.
She develops such a close rapport with her

clients that the other men in her life, her best
friend, Jimmy (Spike Lee, who seems to be
sleepwalking through his usual schtick), and
her ex-husband (Isiah Washington), known
only as "The Shoplifter," start to feel ignored.
The movie ends where it began, with Girl 6
walking out on an offensive movie audition.
The ingredients are here for something
fresh and funny, something even vaguely
entertaining. But "Girl 6" is an irredeemable
mess from square one. It's more an anthology
ofSpike Lee's favorite things ("Foxy Brown,"
"The Jeffersons," baseball cards, Prince,
snazzy camera tricks) than anything approaching a coherent film. The movie uses more
stylistic gimmicks than "JFK," none to any
particular effect. It's neat to look at—candycolored and MTV-slick one minute, gritty
and black and white the next —but that's
about it.
Lee seems desperate, almost as if he knew
that this project was a turkey from the moment he started filming it. "Girl 6" is crammed
with celebrity cameos, most for no particular
reason. Quentin Tarantino (whose acting career should be canceled as soon as possible)
plays the hot-shot director, referred to as
Q.T., for whom Girl 6 is auditioning at the
beginning of the movie. When Q.T. asks Girl
6 to take ofher shirt, Lee is obviously trying
to make a point about the sexist nature of the
Hollywood system. But less than ten seconds
later, he shows Girl 6 taking off her shirt for
his own camera and, in doing so, shoots his
pseudo-feminist agenda in the foot.
Tarantino is used to make a point. The rest
of "Girl 6's" guest celebrities are basically
window dressing. They include Madonna
(complete with Chihuahua), John Turturro,
Naomi Campbell (wearing a "Models Suck"
t-shirt), Richard Belzer, and Halle Berry.

None of these people has much to do, but
most of them will survive this debacle. One
can only hope that Theresa Randle will, too.
She's got enough star-power to make a real
splash, assuming she gets to play a real character, not just a backlit cartoon. It's exhausting to watch a movie with this much talent
and potential, collapse under its own weight.
The fundamental problem is that "Girl 6"
has absolutely no comic timing. It's almost
embarrassing, watching joke after joke
emerge, putter along, and wither away up
there on the screen long after its expiration
date. It doesn't help that the filmmakers
thought it was a good idea to throw in subplots about a little girl who falls down an
elevator shaft and a depraved phone-sex customer with a taste for snuff fantasies. The
juxtaposition of these subplots with the forcibly chipper mood of the surrounding film is
downright disturbing.
"Girl 6" is the worst kind of bad movie, an
embarrassment of colossal proportions from
a generally first-rate filmmaker. It's as if
Spike Lee didn't bother to edit this movie, or
rather that he started editing it before he'd
even finished reading the script. In either
case, it's a disaster, one that all involved
should put behind them as quickly as possible. Lee's been making about a movie a
year for several years now. Maybe he needs a
little time off, time to relax and recover from
this flop. I know I do.

Sixteen Feet Performs in Italy

From

March 8 to 18, Swarthmore'sown
Sixteen Feet toured Italy. They travelled in tour busses, boats, and really,
really small cars. They feasted on seven
course dinners, and slept in a hostel shaped
like a castle tower. They drank lots of wine in
between concerts in the countryside towns of
Ascoli Piceno, San Benedetto del Tronto,
Spinetoli, Fermo, and Jesi (as well as a few
impromptu sings on streets and in coffee
houses).
They lived well and slept little; there was
so much to SEE!
Like the insides of mayors' offices, and the
insidesofRoman baths. They saw the outsides
of bogglingly old buildings, the other side of
a TV camera, and the undersides of intricate
domed ceilings, off of which they bounced
their voices. They saw the faces of many new
friends, very sad to see them leave. Their
generous hosts, Corale Polifonica "Cento
Torn" (named after the 100 towers of beautiful Ascoli Piceno) have invited them back.
A few are saving up again to visit.
I recently dropped in on one of Sixteen
Feet's rehearsals and asked them, "What was
the best thing about your trip?" Every one of
them responded, "The people, definitely."
So, I asked "Okay, what was the SECOND
best thing about the trip?"
Scott: "Being treated like professional musi-

cians."
Jon: "The pasta and rosso vino."
Demetri: "Serafino washed my glass out with
champagne."
Morgan: "The customs guys really don't care
how much liquor you have in your bags."
Ken: "I was almost killed."
Jove: "The history."
Dominic: "Singing at every meal."
Chris: "Being treated like family."
Well, after talking with the guys for a while,
I came to realize that this experience
wasn't just fun, it was also a cultural exchange, and a learning experience. So, I asked,
"What did you Swatties learn in Italy?"
Ken: "Italian men like American women."
Scott: "Un po' di Italiano."
Demetri: "Italians claim thatFabio isn't Italian."
Morgan: "I'm allergic to live shellfish."
Jon: "It's very romantic to go to Italy with
your girlfriend, not quite as romantic to go
to Italy with your girlfriend and her family."
Jove: "You can feel at home even when your
no where near your real one."
Dominic: "What it really means to be Italian:
giovane sempre."
Chris: "The meaning of the word 'gratitude.'"

Out and About

Tiny T's: Bargain for Students
By

Like

John Freeman

the $l.OO slice of pizza and
bottomless diner cup of jo, the famous
$l.OO hoagie of Tiny T's food shop in
Media, PA is a simple and worthy staple of
Philadelphia cuisine facing extinction.
In the past four years, Tiny's hoagies have
appreciated 75%, pushing the two dollar limit
on such extravagant variations such as the
Italian hoagie. Long since buried in the college handbook, Tiny T's has also been facing
diminishing business from the college community. Chances are you haven't heard of
this distinguished joint. Yet for under $2, one
can get a 10 inch hoagie loaded with enough
meat for a prizefighter in training.
Just a mile down Baltimore Pike on the
corner of Manchester, Tiny T's stands out
amidst the chain restaurants and food stores.
In addition to authentic Philly accents and the
feel of a Mafia cover front, Tiny T' s seems to
only hire men with chest measurements over
50 or women with big hair.
When one enters it's good to look assertive
and knowledgeable about what one wants,
otherwise the burly workers will smell the
college Joe and make quick work ofreducing
you to overeducated dribble.
So when you walk in pick out a soft and
somewhat fluffy roll out of a bin and bring it

to the deli counter where the worker will look

through you and give a question of a grunt
that emerges from his face load and sooty like
the city skyline through the oil refiners:
"whatungh?"
Turkey and cheese, Italian, hamand cheese,
cheesesteaks, tuna, vegetarian, among others
will be your choices on the menu board, all
under $2. You can also buy lottery tickets.
Once you've made a decision, the deli man
will throw a 20 pound basketball-size chunk
of meat onto the slicing machine and crank
off at least a pound of succulent super- fresh
deli meat, all the while using his otherhand to
reach for lettuce, cheese, and as many other
condiments as you care to bother him with.
I've hung out inside to munch and drink
down the unfriendly ambiance and bask in
the glare of the deli men, but it's usually more
fun to run out to the car and eat. If you are a
cafe-style person, drive down the Baltimore
Pike another two blocks and cut up to State
Street to the Sweet Potato Cafe and Bakery.
The cafeteria ambiance and too-modern
paintings create an anonymous yet cozy environment. There's a whole plate full of salads,
stuffed vegetables, and soups which perfectly
supplement Tiny T's hoagies. You'll also
find plenty of sweet stuff to go with your
hoagie, and a little more smiles than you'll
get from Tiny T.

months ago I got my navel pierced.

I
well- known place near my home in
northern New Jersey,paid the heavily-pierced
cashier my $46 ($26 for the silver hoop, $lO
for the cleaning solution, and $lO for the
actual piercing—a bargain because I got it
done by an apprentice piercer) and settled
down in a chair that seemed like it was taken
right out of a dentist office.
The two piercers, the apprentice and the
professional that would oversee him, admired
my navel—"lt's perfect for piercing" one
commented. I was still nervous.
The piercing was actually a fairly simple
process. First they squeezed the top of the
navel flat with forceps and put dots where the
hole would be. Then, as I released my breath,
the apprentice stuck the needle through my
skin. Simultaneously, I bit my lip it hurt! He
followed the needle through with the ring,
closed it, and that was that.
Despite the pain, I felt great. It was a rush
of adrenaline that I had only felt before after
swimming a good time on the 1000 yard
freestyle (another painful exercise). The rush
stayed with me for the next few days straight,
every time I touched my navel. Moreover, I
just loved the way the shiny silver looked
against my stomach.
A few years ago, body piercing on this
campus was occasional and unusual; now it is
becoming increasingly frequent. Just walking around the campus, I see more nose and
ear-cartilage piercings than I can count, not to
mention navels, chins, eyebrows, and other
more private piercings.
Exotic body piercing is certainly not a new
phenomena. Navel piercing supposedly originated among the nobility of ancient Egypt,
and the "Prince Albert" variety of male genitalia piercing was named in honor of Queen
Victoria's lover, who, according to legend,
-

had just such a piercing. A resurgence of
body piercing in America began in the early
seventies and has been growing steadily since
then throughout non-mainstream sectors of
society.
Personally, I knew that body piercing must
be getting a higher profile when even my
conservative grandmother wasn't shocked
by my navel ring—"l've heard that's the fad
now" she said.
Is body piercing just a fad? While it is
definitely becoming more common and
trendy, most people with piercings would be
hesitant to label it a fad. Stephanie Bishop
'96, says, "Piercing is putting a needle through
your flesh; I don't think many people would
do that just because it's a fad."
Nevertheless, the power of suggestion has
some influence. I wouldn't have thought to
get my belly button pierced if I didn't know
other people who had gotten it done.As more
people at Swarthmore get pierced, itbecomes
more of an option for people who otherwise
might not have thought of it. Yet, at a basic
level, everyone who's had an unusual piercing insists that it's a personal thing. The
reasons people get piercings can be anything
from a whim to more social or spiritual issues.

Erin Greeson '99, who recently got her
chin pierced, said that her decision was purely
spontaneous. Unlike something like tattoos
(which she has, too) the piercing isn't permanent. It wasn't a difficult decision for her
because she knows that the piercing can always be taken out.
Bryce Walker '9B, who has his eyebrow
and tongue pierced, also said that it was a
spontaneous decision, and that he too will
probably keep the piercings for a while, but
eventually take them out.
Octavio Gonzalez '97, who got his tongue
pierced two years ago, had more serious
motives. "I felt like I was becoming part of a
new tribe" he said, adding that he likes the

feeling of having a metal part of his body. He
asserted that for him, piercing is a very personal thing; his tongue piercing is between
him and who he chooses to kiss. He feels that
piercing is becoming too popular at Swat,
destroying perhaps some of the original point
of being part of a new and different counterculture.
Malado Baldwin-Tejeda '9B agreed, describing how she decided not re-pierce her
navel because she feels it's too trendy now.
She did say, however, that she will always
keep her nose ring, feeling it has become part
of her.
At a very fundamental level, piercing is
about aesthetics. Mainstream society may
not always feel that a pierced lip, for example, is beautiful. The person who pierces
their lip therefore recreates traditional aesthetics into a more personal sense of aesthetics; it is rare for someone to get pierced in a
way which they do not think is aesthetically
pleasing. Alice Unger '9B, who has her nose
pierced and recently got her navel pierced,
says, "The piercings I have really appeal to
my sense of aesthetics: I absolutely love the
way my navel looks!"
What about the question that everyone inevitably asks of a personal who has been
pierced: "Did it hurt?" Yes, it hurts, but if
you're careful with the piercing, it should not
hurt that much (depending, of course, on the
part of the body pierced). I have to say that
one of the most painful piercing stories I've
ever heard involved a botched attempt at ear
piercing at one of those stores in the mall that
uses a piercing gun. I don'trecommend that.
In addition, many people argue that the
pain is an important aspect of the piercing
process. This is why anesthetics are rarely
used in piercing. The pain may be appealing
because it make the piercing a more ritualistic
event or because it creates an increased awareness of that part of the body. At a basic level,
the pain can cause a rush ofadrenaline which

This high may be a reason that people with
exotic piercings often have more than one.
Piercing can be addictive for other reasons as
well. Unger says, "I think that once a person

piercing, they are likely to get another one."
Fakir Musafar, one of the most well-known

The

year was 1881. Swarthmore College consisted of seven buildings:
Parrish Hall, the President's House, a farmhouse, the college barn, a
wooden gym, the Quaker Meeting House, and the Benjamin West House.
Professor Beardsley thought that the College needed a Science Building.
William I Hull's A History of Swarthmore College describes, "Professor
Beardsley, of the Engineering Department, visited Samuel Willets, in New
York, and presented the great need of the College in this respect, receiving from
him the promise to give $lO,OOO toward the building proposed. The Professor
felt that $35,000 would be needed to carry out the plans which he proposed, and
next visited Joseph Wharton, who offered to give what Samuel Willets would,
but no more. Later the plans were so modified as to bring the price down to
$25,000, when Joseph Wharton agreed to give the same as Samuel Willets,
$lO,OOO for the building, and add the $5,000 necessary for its equipment."
The building we now know as Trotter was originally expected to sit west of
Parrish. On September 24, 1881, "a committee of the Managers met at the
College to locate and lay out the new Science Building. The ground was chosen
west of the main building [Parrish], between the College and the President's
house [now part of Sproul Observatory], the East wall of the new building to be
only about 25 feet from the West wall of the College [Parrish]. Some one
objected to this locality as being too near the College in case of fire, as both
buildings would be liable to be destroyed in case of the destruction ofeither. A
highly esteemed business manager, of excellent judgement and large business
experience, remarked that he would not be afraid to assume the personal
responsibility of the loss of the College by fire. The location was accordingly
approved, and the stakes were set."
However, on the night of September 25, a fire in Parrish destroyed all but
building's stone walls. Hull's history records that, "We concluded that the new
site for that building would be no longer urged; and it was not, but it was placed
later where it now stands.. .between the main building and the Meeting House."
The Hall of Physics and Engineering, as it stood the next year, consisted of the
center section of Trotter Hall, flanked by a pair of short one-story wings. The
complete west wing was built in 1895. This addition is still easily discernible
just look for the windows with the brick lintels. A matching East wing, with
stone lintels, was added in 1919. In that year, Hicks Hall was built, and the
engineering department moved out of Trotter, which then bore the name "Hall
of Physics and Biology" until Martin was built in the 19305.
The building housed the physics department until Dupont was finished in
1960,and thenreceived a major renovation. In September of 1960, the Phoenix
reported, "It is now possible to walk from one end of the building to the other
without changing floors several times, and the general atmosphere has been
changed from one of muddy buffs and greys to yellow, orange, and even some
turquoise. 'At last,' a returning sophomore joyously said, 'Trottermakes sense.'"
But this renovation was relatively minor compared to current renovations.
The plans for Trotter, which include turning the basement into a true ground
floor, straightening the hallways, and the addition of an open central staircase,
suggest that by next year, the interior of the second oldest academic building on
campus will change beyond recognition.

SPORTS
Women's Lax Now 4-0
By

Jennifer Z. Chen

Coming off a 16-6 win against
Colorado College on Thursday,
March 21, the women's lacrosse team
embarked on a seven hour journey to
Lynchburg, Virginia, this past weekend. There they encountered a team,
whichCoach KarenBorbee described
as a "competitive, aggressive team
that never gave up." Yet, the Lady
Garnet triumphed againstLynchburg
College's Hornets 10-5.
The second half of the Colorado
College game is an indication ofhow
well the women's lacrosse team can
play this year. During that period, the
team "really started to click as a unit,"
said Coach Borbee.
"Wehave [made] definite improvements with each game. Each successive game has been characterized by
longer and longer periods of our playing together like we know that we
should, and hopefully will, be able to
play for the entire game," said Lia
Ernst '97.
Ernst says the group is so cohesive
because "rather than being a team
with a few stars surrounded by a
supporting cast, [it] is solid in every
position—[it] has no weak spots, nor
is it dominated by the play of only a
few people." The statistics indicate
that both the offensive and defensive
forces have contributed greatly to
this team's present 4-0 record.
On offense, the Lady Garnet have
increased their scoring percentage
with each game. In the Colorado
College game, Swarthmore scored
16 goals on 37 attempts. The goals
came from Lia Ernst '97 (five goals),
Holly Baker '99 (four goals and two
assists), Lara Ewens '96 (two goals
and two assists), Sarah Zuercher '99
(one goal and one assist), Nancy
Rosenbaum '96, Erin Flather '97,
Samantha Peltz '97, and Jen Hagan
'99. Kristen Osbourne '97 and Betsy

Rosenbaum '9B tallied two assists in
the game.
Defensively, the team retrieved 69
ground balls and had eight blocks/
interceptions, whereasColorado College had only 35 ground balls and
two

blocks/interceptions.

Against Lynchburg College,
Swarthmore dominated the entire
game, a ft for the team this year The
team netted 10 goals (Ewens five
goals, Ernst four goals, Baker one
goal and one assist, N. Rosenbaum
two assists, Osborne one assist, and
Katherine Wu '9B one assist) on 28
chances. Lynchburg only tallied five
goals on 20 opportunities. In total
there were 58 groundball retrievals,
of which two were by first-time lacrosse player Danielle Thomas '99,
whose abilities have earned her some
playing time in varsity games.
After they returned from
Lynchburg, the Lady Garnet went on
to defeatWashington College 15-5 in
their first Centennial Conference
game of the season. In this game,
both Ewens (two goals, two assists)
and Osbourne (four goals, one assist)
cashed in on half of their shots. Baker
(three goals, two assists), Ernst (three
goals), and N. Rosenbaum (two goals,
one assist) also contributed to the
score.
Ernst and Ewens are the team scoring leaders with 13 goals each. So far,
the team has an unblemished record
both in and out of conference. On
Saturday, they face another conference rival, the Red Devils of
Dickinson College. With home turf
advantage, the Lady Garnet should
have an exciting game on Saturday at
1 p.m. on Cunningham Fields.

Ted Dixon's participation in cross
country and track and field did not
end when he graduated from college.
He just switched roles. Dixon, head
ofthe men' s and women' s cross country and track programs at S warthmore
has had a long history in the running
field and a pretty successful one at
that.
Coach Dixon graduated from high
school in Duxbury, Massachusetts
where he competed in basketball,
wrestling, and cross country/trackand
field. It was in the latter sport, however, that he found his niche. After
graduation, he attended Bates College, a small liberal arts school much
like Swarthmore, and joined their
Division 111 cross country and track
programs.
Dixon described himself as an average natural athlete, but better than
average in track. He was All New
England six times, runner-up in the
1000 meters in the New England Division 111 Conference Championships, and runner-up in the 800 meters
in the NESCAC (New England Small
College Athletic Conference) championships. He ran everything from
the 4xloom relay to an 8K cross
country race, although the 800 meters

Following his graduation from

Men's Tennis on the Road
By Barry Mook
and George Khalaf

This weekend the men's tennis
team opened its season with a doubleheader against two national power-

houses, Kalamazoo College and
Emory University. After finishing
1 lth at the 1995 NCAA Division 111
national tournament, the Garnetsquad
hoped to upset the nation's third- and
fifth- ranked teams. Unfortunately,
the competition proved too strong, as
the team suffered two 6-1 defeats.
Late Saturday morning, in the blistering Atlanta sun, the Garnet was
caught off guard. The first and second doubles teams were outplayed
by the more seasoned Kalamazoo
players. The duo of Greg Emkey '99
and Steve Richards '99 contributed
the only doubles victory, winning a
9-8 match that lasted well over an
hour. Now facing a 0-1 deficit, the
Garnet needed wins in 4 out of the 6
single matches to ensure a victory.

he described it, he would attend class
for three months or so and then drive
to San Diego to coach for another
three months. In order to pay for
school, his rent, etc., Coach Dixon
sold everything from perfume, to
Volkswagens, to gin and tonics.
In 1993, Dixon was laid off when
San Diego cut their men's track program. Unfortunately, his fiancee, a
journalist, had the same bad luck. Set
to be married on the second of January that same year, the two of them
moved back east with no money and
no place to live.
Coach Dixon had gone to every
athletic department in the Philadelphia area looking for work when he
finally walked into Bob Williams's
office and asked if Swat needed any
help in their running programs. Ironically, the former men's and women's
track and cross country coaches had
just left their jobs and in slid Ted.
Ted is really happy with things at
Swarthmore in the track and cross

school is able to provide athletes with
limitless possibilities in athletics and
believes that student-athletes enjoy

Since
he was hired, the men's and women's
teams were combined and Dixon sees
this as a great situation where no one
is left out in the cold.
There is always a coach to turn to
and a chance to get involved in any
aspect of the sport. Dixon's main
goal as a coach is first to provide
quality experience for track and cross
country athletes, and second to win
which provides a higher quality experience than losing. As far as this
season is concerned, he sees a better
team than last year but knows that
there is still a long way to go.
In addition to his duties as coach,
Ted holds many other duties in the
athletic department. He is in charge
of P.E. requirements; student workers; van transportation; facility scheduling for varsity teams, clubs, and
outside groups; equipment bills; and
all pre-season duties. Although he
really just wants to coach, these other

Unfortunately, Roger Werner '9B produced the only point for the Garnet in

After eating nutritious meals at
Wendy' s and Mickey D' s and checking in at the Travelodge, the Garnet
felt prepared to face the Emory Eagles
early on Sunday morning. But the
doubles teams were swept by Emory
in three long-lasting matches. Said
Khalaf, "Our doubles lineup may not
have been good enough to beat
Emory, but just wait until we play
Williams and Amherst." When reminded about losses in previous years
the Lebanese co-captain remarked
that "Werner and Mook have developed the chemistry that belongs to a
real number-one team. With singles
to back us up, I believe our team
should do well enough in our region
to contend for a NCAA national bid."
Emkey's strong all-court game
proved too much for the Eagles' number six seed. Mook, Ernst andWerner
all lost in three sets, while Khalaf and
Slimack lost in two close sets.
Looking back at the results of the
weekend, Emkey remarked, "Pretty
much all thematches could have gone
either way. It's good to see people
playing hard. The wins will
come...it's all mello yo." This next
weekend the Garnet will be on the
road once again. This time, they will

will be essential if the men's tennis
team wants to seriously consider itself a candidate for the NCAA national tournament in May.

Men's Lax Beats Shenandoah, Loses to Colby
By

Pat Donaghy

For the second week in a row, the
men's lacrosse team split its two
games, fighting its way to a 13-10
victory over Shenandoah Saturday
before losing to Colby 12-8 on
Wednesday. The Garnet'srecord now
stands at 2*4 heading into an extremely tough conference schedule.
Four ofS warthmore' s six conference
opponents are ranked in the top 15 in
the country.
All season long, Swarthmore has
been a little sluggish out of the starting blocks. After spotting Shenandoah
a two goal first quarter lead, Jerahme
Posner '97 netted his first collegiate
goal on an off-speed shot. This was
the first of an offensive onslaught
that included 41 shots and assists on
11 of the 13 goals. Later in the quarter, when Andy Place '96 scored the
first ofhis four goals, the Garnet took
a4-3 lead that they never relinquished.
In the second half, a goal by Ben
Seigel '96 (two goals, five assists)
extended the lead to 10-6. But aided
by a few hometown calls, the opponents pulled to within two points of
Swarthmore and had a two-man advantage because of penalties. Amazingly, the defense killed the penalty
to preserve the win. Aaron Hultgren

'9B stepped up to the challenge of
guarding the best Shenandoah player
and shut him down.
Place earned Conference Player of
the Week for his four goal performance. Pete Hamilton '97 and Dave
Sturtevant' 96 dominated the faceoffs,
which had been a problem in the
beginning of the year.
The Garnet was hoping to keep up
the momentum against Colby, a nationally ranked team who had been
in
spending Spring Break
Swarthmore. This would be a tough
challenge, as Colby had a 40 man
roster, compared to just 20 on
Swarthmore's sideline. But
Swarthmore came out firing, looking
to upset the visitors from Maine.
The Garnet pulled out to an early 31 first quarter lead on goals by Kevin
Frazier '96, Will Craig '96, and
Seigel. In addition, the Garnet were
dominating the groundball battles.
Things began to fall apart whenleading goal scorer Place separated his
shoulder early in the second quarter.
Even though Swarthmore's man up
offense was not able to run plays in
Place's absence, Seigel and Pat
Donaghy '97 found the back of the
net just before halftime to bring the
score to 6-3.
While the Garnet were then smell-

ing victory, Colby finally came together and ruined any upset plans by
scoring six third quarter goals. The
Garnet offense was not able to hold
the ball, and the defense was giving
up too many shots. In the fourth quarter, the offense finally got back in the
game, but the Colby goalie made six
ofeight saves to ensure victory. Coach
Pat Gress said that the team "gave an
outstanding effort, and they should
be proud that they fought until the
end against a tough team like Colby."
Fans at the game were impressed
by the difference in the Garnet's quality of play between this year and last.
Most of the credit goes to Coach
Gress and the willingness to work
hard by the players. The team holds a
2-2 record against Division 111 opponents, with bothlosses coming against
highly skilled teams.
With six ofthe sixteenregular players not on Swarthmore's squad last
year, Coach Gress has had to really
work hard to mold the team. Key
player position moves has also helped
the team, such as moving Seigel from
attack to middie and putting Adam
Macßeth '99 in his place. Overall,
the team is coming together and will
be ready to face a powerful Western
Maryland (6-0, ranked #l5) team on
April 6.

Nationals Showcase

Swarthmore Swimmers
By

Marla Kaufman

The past two weekends, members
of both the men's and women's swim
team traveled to Atlanta to compete
in the Division 111 national meet. The
swimmers surpassed any preconceived expectations of their performances by bringing home 16 AilAmerican certificates and shattering
numerous college records.

Sue Davis, the head coach of the
men's and women's teams, called
Swarthmore's showing at nationals
"an outstanding performance!"
On the men's side, Andy Robbins
'9B and Kendrew Witt '96 represented

the Swarthmore team in their first
national competition. Robbins tore

up the water in the 100 and 200 Backstroke and 50 Freestyle. In the 200

Back, Robbins placed 11th with a
time of 1:54.44. His All-American
swim was the first for the men since
Robert McKinstry in 1975.
Witt, who qualified with the 'B'
cut for the last two years but was not
invited to compete, finally made his
way to nationals this year. He competed in the 100 and 200 Breastroke.
The women had seven swimmers
competing, which is the most in
Swarthmore swimming history. Of
this seven, five were freshmen and
one was a sophomore, a testament to
the promise of such a youthful team.
The sole senior member of the
squad, Skye Fulkerson '96, is also a
two-year veteran ofthe national meet.
She added to her previous individual
Ail-Americans by placing 6th in the
100Breastroke with a time of 1:07.07.

and

Fulkerson was also a part of three
All-American relay teams. The 400
Medley Relay, composed ofKristen

Robertson '9B, Fulkerson, Cathy
Polinsky '99, and Jenny Harvey '99,
placed 11th, setting a new school
record at the same time.
Fulkerson, Polinsky, Harvey, and
Janine Gent '99 placed 16th in the
200 Freestyle Relay, again in school
record time. Alanna Roazzi '99,
Fulkerson, Polinsky, and Gentplaced
Bth in the 200 Medley Relay.
Polinsky had technical trouble in
the 100 Butterfly where she lost her
goggles. She swam the event the next
day in the 100Freestyle, in which one
can swim any stroke, and finished in
a time of 59.09, which would have
gained her All-American status.
In the 200 Breastroke, Harvey
placed 15th in an All-American time
of2:28.70. Jill Belding '99 was also
an All-American swimmer, finishing the 200 Butterfly in 2:08.33, a
new school record.
The national meet was an end to
an excellent season for the swim
team. Coach Davis said that going
into the season that she knew both
teams would have the opportunity to
have their most successful seasons
ever.
Davis commented that although
success can be measured by the outstanding win/loss records of both
teams, the "true success was whole
tenor of the team. It was a group of
people who believed the could be
successful and came together as a
cohesive group. As a result they were
extremely successful."
Davis attributes much of the success of this year's team to the leadership of senior tri-captains, Maria
Kaufman, Sarah Werneck, and Witt.
Many swimmers are now avoiding
Ware Pool, hoping that lingering chlorine smell will wash out of their skin
and hair sometime before the end of
the semester. The die hards, however, can be still be found in action
during water polo practice (Tuesday
from4:oo-5:00, Saturdayfrom 10:0012:00). But, you'll have to wait until
next year for the bronze bodies, new
haircuts, and shaved arms and legs
that mark the height of swim season.

Women's Rugby Team Wins Opener
By

Annie Bacon

"That was one of the best first
games we've ever played in" said
captain Rebecca Cole '96 about
Saturday's rugby game against Bryn
Mawr/Haverford. Despite the snow
before the game, the women's rugby
team warmed up fast and proceeded
to defeat their tri-co rivals in the A
side game and suffer a close, 12-10
defeat in the B side game.
Swarthmore was ahead most of the B
side game, until the last three minutes when Bryn Mawr/Haverford
scored a try, followed by a beautifully placed penalty kick.
The first few minutes of the A side
game were uninterrupted by the
whistle, as both teams cleanly executed their lines, rucks, and tackles.
It wasn't until Bryn Mawr had a
knock-on, that the whistle blew and
Swarthmore had the opportunity to
win their first scrum.
Throughout the entire A side game,
the scrums were very strong, and
there wasn't nearly as much "wheeling" (which happens whenthe scrum
rotates as a result of one side pushing
harder, or the wrong size match-up)
as a season opener usually contains.
The forward rucks were strong as

well, and the back line's "jingle
jangle" allowed Swarthmore to successfully move the ball up the field.
In the B side game there was a little
bit ofhesitation about going into some
of therucks, but once formed they too
were strong. In both games the back
lines as well as the forwards consistently supported their team mates.
Swarthmore scored three tries, all
in the second halfof the A side game.
The first was touched down by Cole,
the next by Jen Philpot '97, and Kelly
Shannon '96 scored the third off a
quick Bryn Mawr penalty.
Swarthmore had very few penaltiesand was quick to advance the ball
when the whistle blew against Bryn
Mawr. The final score of the A side
game was 15-12.
The B side gamelooked very good
as well.Long-time rugby player Katie
Laird '96 (who's now playing Lacrosse) came to play in the game.
Aside from the leadership she provided, Laird scored the first B side try
of the season.
Susan Rivera '96 scored the second try, right before she was tackled
hard from behind by a Bryn Mawr
rugger. The Swarthmore B side team
was then ahead until the last three
minutes. Bryn Mawr scored a try in

the comer of the zone, and then pro-

ceeded to get the conversion points
with a beautiful kick, claiming a victory for their team with a final score
of 12-10. But everyone walked off
the sunny field feeling good about
the over all level of play during the
game.
Swarthmore's game tomorrow is
away, against Rutgers University. In
order to be ready for theirfield, which
is longer and less flat than our home
field, the team has been doing a lot of
fitness during the second half of the
week. The next home gameis a week
from this Saturday, on April 6against
Millersville at 11:00 (A side) and
12:30 (B side) on the DuPont field,

there at 4:29. Fred Gerson '99, the
newest mid-distancerunner to hit the
scene, made his debut coming across
at a 4:35, followed soon after by
Noah Daniels '9B.
Wyn Strodtbeck '9B emerged as
second overall in the 800 m in a respectable time of2:00, while Gordon
Roble '99 fought off the competition
down the last stretch to take fifth with
2:02. And biting gusts of wind and
arctic temperatures meant nothing to
the ruggedly rampaging Tim Sibley
'9B, who captured a personal record
(PR)of 2:05, winning his heat by,
well, several long noses. John Freeman '96 came across at a gutsy 2:09,
whileNevin Katz '99 finished in 2:12.
The distance events were wrapped up
with Jeff Lockman '9B, the single
distance man to take on the rigors of
the 5000, flying through 12.5 laps in
a PR of 18:31.
The near-palpable potential the
4x400m relay team showed in Florida
went fully unrealized, as the squad
consisting of Turner, Sam Paschel
'96, Reuben Canada '99, and Eric
Pakurar '97 ran eight seconds slower
than their best mark. Still, the 3:31
time was good enough to beat all but
one of the competition.
Performances in the field events
were especially affected by the obscene weather, with the exception of
two PR's in the disc by Brian Baird
'99 and Mason Tootel '99 both with
throws of 98'. Eric Walton '97 took
seventh place with 115' in the disc
while Dan Fanaras '99 hit 110'.
Shan Sutherland '97 and Nate Mason '99 took second and thirdrespectively in the pole vault, both with
vaults of 12'6", and the 4xloo team
ofTootel, Turner, Paschel and Canada
took fourth place.
The F&M meet, while disappointing in terms of times and performances, did serve to show the team
that they are still better than the bulk
of the conference that showed up for
the meet. Look for another trouncing
this Saturday as Swat track and field
kicks off a three-week home meet
marathon as they host Haverford,
Lebanon Valley, Ursinus, and Widener.

As the Swarthmorebus pulled into
the parking lot and the team attempted
to seek shelter from cold and high
winds in the brand new indoor facilitiesofFranklin & Marshall, it seemed
that the host team meant to break the
spirits ofthe gallant S watties by transferring them from one shelter to another.
Undaunted, the Swatties forged
ahead to the mighty oval track. The
perseverance of the Swatties showed
through as they arrived earlier than
any other teams, wondering if competitors would even bother to show
up. As the morning wore on, other
teams began to arrive, timidly glancing toward Swarthmore's powerhouse athletes in fear.
With arms as strong and powerful
as Hercules, Heather "The Heat"
Mateyak '97 and Amy "The Arm"
Cuthrell '97 competed in the shot,
discus, and javelin. Stephanie Herring '99, withthe ceaseless energy of
a Tazmanian Devil, spun into sixth
place in the long jump.
One of the finest performances this
weekend was by Catherine Laine '9B,
who finished the 100 m hurdles in
17.31 seconds. Herring, making her
maiden voyage in the 400 hurdles,
finished an awe-inspiring fourth overall.
Laine ran away with another third
place finish in the open 100m, an

The women's tennis team suffered
its first loss at home on Tuesday
against Washington College, but the
team continues to maintain its optimism for the season. Washington presented the Swat women with a strong
line-up, finally winning 8-1.
In doubles, Swarthmore produced
no wins, but fought hard. At first
doubles, Michelle Martinez '97 and
Hilary Gehlbach '96 had some communication difficulties, losing to
Washington's top two players.
Rani Shankar' 98 and Neena Shenai
'9B came close to a victory at second
doubles, losing 8-6, while Nga Lai
'97 and Elena Rosenbaum '9B could
not get the best of their opponents at
third doubles.
In singles, Rosenbaum was the lone
winner of the day, posting a win in
three sets at #6 singles, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2.
Shenai, playing at fourth singles, continued her trend of staying on the

court until the frost set in, finally lost

in a tiebreaker which substituted for a
third set because of darkness.
Martinez put up a strong fight at
#1 singles against her powerful opponent, while Shankar, playing at #3
singles, grew frustrated with the
"fluff her opponent was throwing
back at her.
Yesterday, against Western Maryland, Swat reverted to its Hilton Head
pattern, coming up just short to their
opponents, 4-5. In doubles, Gehlbach
and Martinez pulled out a victory,
winning 8-1 in the proset. Shenai and
Shankar, and Valerie Threlfall '96
and Wendy Kemp '99, playing at 2nd
and 3rd doubles, respectively, both
hadclose matches, but could not come
through with the win.
The other wins came from
Martinez, playing at #1 singles,
Shankar, playing at third singles, and
Shenai, playing at fourth singles. The
fan support was not enough for

Swarthmore men's rugby began
their season last Saturday against a
unique foe, a team that contained
some players who had previously
been members of the Swarthmore
Evil Buzzards. Jefferson Medical
School, a graduate school located in
Philadelphia, gave Swarthmore as
much as they could handle as the two
teams played to a 26-26 tie.
Jefferson Med was bolstered by
three Swarthmore alumni, drop-kick
king Scott Lock '93, Mike Madden
'95, and Justin McLean '95. The
Buzzards were very fortunate that
McLean was not playing scrum half,
where he has been known to mangle
opponents.
Swarthmore, led by two tries by
co-captain Jason Dougal '96, was up
by 12 points late in the second half,
but Jefferson Med came back with
two tries in the waning moments to
salvage a tie.
"We should have won," said
Dougal. "We played a very good fundamental game,but there were some
little things we didn't do. "It was
unforntuate that we were playing such
a experienced team, because they
capitalized on those little things."
The game started on a solid note
for The Buzzards. Dougal blocked a
kick by Lock within the first five
minutes, and recovered the ball in the
try zone for a quick 5-0 lead.
A penalty kick by Lock and try by
Jefferson Med's wing gave them an
11-5 lead, but that was short-lived.
Swarthmore answered with a try by

in fifth.
In an unfortunate handoff incident,
the 4xloom relay team was disqualified, but they more than redeemed
themselves in the 4x400m relay. Even
the disgruntled anchor admitted that
winning by a margin that seemed like
miles made her role easier to bear.
Apparently the dominance of
Donna Griffin '99 was anticipated,
for she was placed in the fast heat and

did not disappoint fans, finishing a
strong fourth and capturing a personal record with a 2:37.5.
Finally, in the longest and most
grueling event of the day, when the
wind seemed to pick up in anticipation, Alison Schirmer '97 and
Shoshannah Pearlman '9B struggled
against all odds to capture second and
third place, respectively.
To witness these women performing like the Greek goddesses of the
Olympiads, come this Saturday where
they'll be performing live on home
turf.

Alec Stall '9B off of a penalty play.
Stall dragged two defenders into the
try zone with him for a score.
Lock hit another penalty kick from
48 yards out for a 14-12 Jefferson
Med lead at the half.
Swarthmore scored first in the next
period, as Matt Miller '96 ended up
scoring after the Buzzards won alineout and pushed the ball in. Later in
the half, Dougal ran down a kick and
scored again. Senior Chaz Teplin's
conversion gave Swarthmore a seemingly safe 26-14 lead with little time
left.
But Jefferson Meddid not give up.
On secondphase activity, a back from
Jefferson was able to get into the try
zone for the score. JeffersonMed tied
the game just minutes later, when, in
the chaos following a grub kick, they
scored another try.
The game was not completely over,
and Swarthmore came out strong.
They were able to keep the ball in
Jefferson Med's half of the field for
the rest of the game but could never
score. Hearts sank on the Buzzards'
sideline when Teplin missed a short
penalty kick for the win in the final
moments.

In B-side action, Swarthmore
fielded its largest team in years. The
team was also very inexperienced
and was dominated by the Jefferson
Med B-side. Swarthmore lost 25-3,
with Swarthmore's lone points coming from a penalty kick by Mike Schall
'99. The team did show many signs
of life, though, and is expected to do
much better as the season progresses.
The Buzzards will attempt to
caputre theirfirst win this weekend at
Lafayette.

Momentum has

slowed for

Swarthmore softball this week as the
team fought the cold both at home
and on the road. It was a disapointing

backboard who posed as her opponent at second singles; she succumbed
in a tiebreaker in the first set, resulting in a 7-6 (8-6), 6-2 loss. Rosenbaum
suffered similar aggravation in her
match at sth singles, while Elisa
Nigrini '99 made her debut at #6
singles. The team travels to Ursinus

week for the Garnet women as they
came up winless in the first doubleheader of the season against Drew
University and their conference
opener, a pair of games against Washington College.
Swarthmore held both teams tight
in the first game of each double
header, but couldn't hang tough to
challenge themfor the second games.
Bright spots for the team include more
agressive defensive plays and stronger bats from the entire lineup.
Also notable from this week are a
shocker homerun over the
centerfielder's head by Michelle
Walsh '9B against Washington, and a
good showing from catcher Apryl
Dunning '99 as she debuted on the
pitching mound against Drew.
Take time out of your busy weekend schedule Saturday to come down
and support the team as they take on
Gettysburg here at Swarthmore at
one p.m. Pull up a piece of grass on
the hill and watch the action.
