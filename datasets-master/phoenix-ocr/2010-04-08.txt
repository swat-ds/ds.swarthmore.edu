From Monday until yesterday, Students for
Peace and Justice in Palestine spearheaded
a series of events called "Three Days in
Palestine." The group said that these events,
which most notably included a simulation of
a West Bank security checkpoint, were
meant to raise consciousness of Israel's
occupation of the West Bank. Page 3

Sarah Brajtbord 'll said her visit to
Palestine after her freshman year made a
dramatic impact on her.
"Going through the checkpoints [of
the West Bank] as a privileged American,
especially as a privileged Jewish
American, was one of the most profound
and emotional experiences of my life, and
it's really something that brought me to
the level ofactivism and the commitment
to [lsraeli-Palestine relations] that I have
today," she said.
A leader of Students for Peace and
Justice in Palestine, Brajtbord was
instrumental in the planning and execution of this week's "Three Days in
Palestine," which featured a screening of
"Divine Intervention" on Tuesday, a discussion forum facilitated by Assistant
Dean and Director of the Intercultural
Center Rafael Zapata last night, and,
most notably, a simulation of an Israeli
checkpoint within the West Bank which
divides Israel and Palestine.
There was a tall black wall erected in
front-of Parrish, blocking off Magill
Walk, out of chain-link, barbed wire and
black plastic trash bags.
Students had the option of walking
through the checkpoint and past students
acting as members of the Israeli Defense
Force or avoiding the checkpoint by taking one of the other paths to the south
end of campus. Those who chose to go
through the checkpoint received a slip of
paper with information about their identity, which the "soldiers" questioned
them about. Students were randomly
assigned nationalities, religions and permit statuses. Depending on the identity,
the soldiers would let them pass, question them or turn them away.
"We thought of having an event that
will involve as many students as possible, in a visible place so that people who
don't choose to participate will be curious about what's happening," said Nidal
al-Ayassa 1L who grew up in Palestine
and serves as another leader of SPJP.
"Our attempt was to bring a glimpse at
what everyday life is like for Palestinians

College extends Anderson's
term, Braun to lead hiring

WEEK IN PICTURES

BY MENGHAN JIN
mjinl@swarthmore.edu

Andrew Cheng Phoenix Staff

A group of students enjoy their lunch, the warm weather and the cherry blossoms
during an impromptu picnic.

For the 2010-11 school year, Diane
Anderson will serve another term as
Acting Associate Dean of Academic
Affairs while Dean of StudentsDesignate
Liz Braun and the
Committee on Faculty Procedures, or
COFP, will search for a faculty member to permanently take the position.
After the departure offormer Dean
of Students Jim Larimore and former
President Al Bloom last year for NYU
Abu Dhabi, Anderson, then full-time
associate professor of education,
filled Garikai Campbell '9o's position
as Acting Associate Dean of Academic
Affairs for this academic year as
Campbell temporarily took on
Larimore's role.
Though Anderson originally only
planned to serve one year, the Dean's
Office thought it was best to extend
Anderson's term for another academic year due to time constraints and
the appointment of Braun.
Garikai Campbell '9O, acting dean
of students, was Associate Dean for
Academic Affairs before Anderson.
On July 1 he will become the Special
Assistant to the President and
Associate �Vice
President
for
Planning.

"We are still a dean's area in transition," Anderson said. "I felt very
strongly that I would like to help with
that transition and not cause further
disruption. I think it's important to
the students
and to the college to
have as much stability as we go forward with a new dean."
With one full year of experience
working in the Dean's Office,
Anderson has formed many new relationships and strengthened many
existing ones with faculty members
and students. According to Campbell,
Anderson is vital in maintaining continuity within the dean's staff.
"Having someone who understands
the office, has the experience of having been in the office for a full year, is
well-respected by the faculty and
brings such a terrific understanding
of the interface between the dean's
office and the faculty is really critical," he said.
Braun said that she is thrilled that
Anderson has agreed to extend her

term.

"I've been very impressed with her
and her sense of students and the college as a whole," she said. "I think
she's going to be a terrific colleague
and I'm really looking forward to having an opportunity to work* closely
with her."
While Anderson is in office next
year, Braun and faculty members
elected to COFP will organize a search
committee consisting of other faculty,
staff and students to conduct a search
among faculty applicants to fill the
position.

nent faculty appointments," Braun

said.
When Anderson was first asked to
be acting associate dean last summer,
she was hesitant to accept the offer.

April 8, 2010

Anderson said that she loved teaching
the educational studies department
and her research in the field ofliteracy so much that she needed a couple
days to come to a decision.
"I have been interested for a number of years in being in a position like
this at some point during my professional life; it just came sooner than I
expected it to," she said. "But the
more I thought about it, the more
excited I was each day to think about
actually doing it."
This year as acting associate dean
for academic affairs, Anderson found
a way to incorporate teaching into her
schedule. She is currently teaching
"Literacies and Social Identities" in
the department of educational studies
and plans on teaching her honors literacy research seminar next spring.
"Personally I will certainly miss
her in the department, being here regularly. She's such a joy to work with,"
said Kae Kalwaic, administrative
assistant for the educational studies
department.

Jake Ban 'lO, an Educational
Studies Special Major and a previous
student of Anderson's, said that she
seems well-suited for the role.
"The position is a natural fit for
her and her talents," he said. "She is
probably one of the warmest people at
Swarthmore."
The department of educational
studies is adjusting accordingly to the
limited presence of Anderson, said
Chair of the Department Ann
Renninger. Other faculty in the
department will cover Anderson's
courses. There is no need to hire a
new faculty member, she said.
Taking on this new role, Anderson
has been an excellent addition in the
Dean's Office, receiving only positive
feedback from many members of the
community,
President
college
Rebecca Chopp said.
"She knows the school very well;
she's very open and accessible to students. We've all heard good things
about her from the students with
whom we've spoken," Chopp said.
Pulling students into the dean's
area was perhaps the biggest obstacle
Anderson faced as acting associate
dean for academic affairs. Whether
due to their preconceptions about
deans or their busy schedules, many
students do not take advantage of
each dean's willingness to help out
students in times of struggle, she said.
Anderson's own experience as a
student in college was "terrible," she
said. She went to Muhlenberg College
and then transferred to Montclair
State College.
"I often call my experience of
working at Swarthmore College my
'do-over' and I work really hard to
help students
have a better experience in college than I was able to have
and to be launched into their intellectual and professional and personal
lives in a way that is much more
enriching than mine was."
When students do seek her help,
during the small moments when her
advice leads to sudden realizations,
"those are those moments that make
me feel that what I'm doing in here,
behind closed doors in confidence,
might make a difference," she said.

While others go 'need-aware,' college consistent in policy

are admitted through a need-aware policy.
Two years ago, Carleton admitted 2 percent

BY LINDA HOU

With few indications of the economy
quickly
making
a
full recovery,
Swarthmore will have to find ways to maintain its financial aid and admissions policies, especially since the college has had a
30 percent increase in financial aid expenses from two years ago to now, according to
Director of Financial Aid Laura Talbot.
Meanwhile, comparable colleges have also

faced difficult decisions in those policies.
"What we've seen is that the financial
aid, year after year, has been one of the
fastest growing parts of the college's budget," Sue Welsh, vice president for finance
and treasurer, said. "And we've been able to
pay for that with gifts to the endowment
and because the endowment has been doing
well. The big worry for us now as a longer
term is if this growth rate increases, will
we be able to*keep up."
As of March this year, Swarthmore is
one of 46 U.S. colleges that has both needblind admissions for U.S. nationals and permanent residents and meets-all demonstrated need of admitted students, according to. the U.S. News and World Report. A
need-blind policy disregards a student's
financial aid need when making admissions decisions.
When asked if Swarthmore's financial
aid program will be sustainable in the
future in spite of such increases, both
Welsh and Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid Jim Bock '9O said that keeping need-blind admissions and meeting all
financial aid needs of admitted will be a
challenge but, at the same time, remain a
priority to the college.
Samuel Hayes '57, however, believes that
Swarthmore will not be able to afford needblind admissions in the future. Hayes is a

member of the Swarthmore Board of
Managers and the Jacob H. Schiff Chair in
Investment Banking Emeritus at the
Harvard Business School.
"I think that the cost of the package that
we're providing on an unlimited basis for
entering students is going to be very difficult to support given our endowment and
the trends in admissions applications,"
Hayes said.
Bock also said that this is not a problem
unique to Swarthmore and that the college
is doing well compared to many others.
"This is a problem not just for
Swarthmore, but all of higher-education,"
Bock said. "I'm thrilled that
even in a
time of crisis, we've been able to provide
financial aid."
Some colleges, for example, have shifted
away from a need-blind policy and toward a
"need-aware" or "need-sensitive" policy. A need-aware policy allows colleges to
take whether or not students applied for
financial need into account while making
admissions decisions.
A New York Times article from March of
last year reported, however, that this policy
typically "goes to the students at the margins, the ones who would probably be
"maybes' when the admissions committee
considered applications. Those students are
less likely to get in if they are financially
needy and more likely to get in if they can
afford to pay."
Among other colleges, Bryn Mawr, Reid
and Carleton have recently become needaware.
According to Carleton Dean of
Admissions and Financial Aid Rod Oto, ■
Carleton admits students under need-blind,

financial aid budget limits. Then students

THE PHOENIX

of its freshman class under need-aware
admissions. Last year, they did safor 8 percent of their students. Like Swarthmore,
though, Carleton meets full demonstrated
needs of its students.
"Our decision in terms of being needsensitive is that there's no reason to admit
somebody if we can't fund them properly,
especially given the cost of our school," Oto
said. "We try to be need-blind for "most of
the process, but at the end, because of the
budget, we have to be need-sensitive. We
simply don't have enough money to fund all
of the students."
Welsh said at Swarthmore that 57 percent offinancial aid is funded by the endowment that is specifically for financial aid,
while the rest comes from endowment with
no restrictions on how it could be spent.
About half of Swarthmore's operating
budget depends on the endowment. The
true cost of a student to attend Swarthmore
is about $87,000. Minus tuition, the rest
comes from the .endowment. In a way,
Welsh said, even the full-paying students
were receiving financial aid from the college.

"Until the financial crisis in the past
years, the endowment was growing. So [the
increased cost of financial aid] wasn't coming at the expense of anything. Everything
was growing. Growth in financial aid might
now begin to compete with the rest of our
budget," Welsh said.
Swarthmore's endowment saw a 30 percent, or about $4OO million, decrease in
endowment value between June 2008 and
June 2009. The endowment did notbegin to
decrease until the 2007-2008 school year.
The latest data released on the college's
website said that the endowment's market
value was $ll billion as of June 23, 2009,
making Swarthmore 12th in terms of
endowment per student ratios in the US.
Oto said that Carleton hopes to have
need-blind admissions when possible.
While he does not think being need aware
discourages students from applying to
Carleton, Oto said that having the need
aware policy reduces diversity at Carleton.
"We continue to look for the possibility
of change [for the admissions policy], but
it's going to take time and money," Oto said.
"[Carleton is] not as diverse as it could be,
and obviously there are some students that
could add to diversity that are not admitted
because their need is too high."
Hayes, however, said that need-blind
admissions is not necessary for a diverse
student body.
"I think that we can sustain a very
diverse student body without need-blind
admissions. We can use our resources or
financial aid to insure that we obtain a
diverse student body," Hayes said.
Hayes said that as schools like Carleton
become need-aware or even need-based,
Swarthmore will have an increase in number of applicants who need financial aid.
"With a shrinking number of colleges
and universities continuing to offer needblind admission, a disproportionate number of needy students will be applying to
this smaller
ofneed-blind admissions
institutions," he., s said. "Therefore, we
have to expect that the proportion of the
entering class requiring financial aid are
likely to rise."

Parker said Amherst will cut back on
other parts in the budget and will probably
maintain their need-blind admissions policy in future years. Amherst saw a 201 percent decrease in its endowment last'year,
and increased its expected summer earnings contributions for the 2010-2011 school
year.
Williams College and Middlebury
College had implemented need-blind policies for all students until two years ago,
when they changed to need-aware admissions for internationals due to budget

Amherst College expanded need-blind
admissions not only to U.S. nationals and
permanent residents but also to international students beginning with the class of
2013. Swarthmore is not need-blind for
international students.
According to Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid Tom Parker at Amherst, the
percent of international students enrolled
per class has increased from 5.5 to 10 percent since the college made this change.
"The number of applicants has grown
and the diversity of the pool has grown,"
Parker said. "Ironically, the number of fullpaying applicants has increased as well. I
think [having need-blind admissions for all
students] has a symbolic effect."
Amherst is one of six colleges to have
need-blind admissions for all students
while meeting their demonstrated need.
The other five colleges are Dartmouth
College,
Harvard University, MIT,
Princeton University and Yale University.
At Swarthmore, Bock said, every year,
about 10 percent of the college's financial
aid budget is allotted for international students. This means that the college will estimate how many international students who
need financial aid the 10 percent can provide for, and only accept the number of
international applicants who applied for
financial aid that would yield that number
of students. This policy is necessary, Bock
said, because international students tend to
need more aid. Currently, Swarthmore is
seven percent international, and about half
of the international students receive financial aid.

reductions.

"The recent and ongoing recession has
made it necessary to severely cut back on
expenditures," said Dick Nesbitt, Dean of
Admissions at Williams, in an e-mail.
"Since moving to [the need-blind] policy in
2006, our financial aid budget soared astronomically as the percentage of internationals swelled to almost 9 percent of the student body. With this new policy, we are better able to manage our numbers."
Nesbitt said that Williams has also reinstituted loans in the financial aid packages
of students whose annual family income
exceeds $75,000 as a part of their budget cut.
Welsh, Bock and Talbot all said that it
will be the colleges' priority to insure needblind admissions and meeting full demonstrated need of admitted students.
"The decision about financial aid is
renewed rather than opened up and started
from scratch," Talbot said. "It's an important central focus of Swarthmore's mission
to make certain that students of" all economic backgrounds can go."

Lauded economist details 'randomista' perspective
BY ALLISON GANTT
aganttl@swarthmore.edu

Linking economics with psychology and
experimental research, Yale University

Economics Professor Dean Karlan discussed his "randomista" research on the
economics of poverty in various countries
around the world in a lecture on Friday
afternoon.
While waiting for Karlan, who was
stuck in traffic on the New Jersey
Turnpike, about 40 students listened to Rob
Hollister, chair of the Swarthmore economics department, explain that Karlan came
from the school of thought of the "randomistas," or behavioral economics.
Karlan entered the room in the midst of
a discussion of the merits of this method.
"The applied behavioral work is basically
saying,
'Theory's
good,

but let's see if we
can use this stuff
to actually change
things,'" Karlan

said.

young

researchers," according to the New York
Times. Karlan most recently received an
Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship in
2008, granted to the most distinguished
young researchers in the country.
Karlan explained the concept behind
behavioral economics through a series of
pictures, including one from failblog.org
that showed exercisers going to a 24-hour
fitness gym by escalator instead of the
nearby stairs.
Through this picture and throughout
his presentation, Karlan emphasized that
"people are complicated." He said that it is
the job of a behavioral economist to figure
out not only the best prices or choices to
reach a particular goal but also to figure
out what might "nudge" a person to choose
one thing over another.
"The way things.are presented might
actually change behavior in ways that are
far more significant than the terms,"
Karlan said.
Hollister explained that the "randomista" method establishes a control
group and an experimental group and then
runs trials with these groups to establish
causality.

Debate exists, however, about this
method.
Experiments can be costly, time-consuming or difficult to generalize. Believers
of the opposing methodology support examining and analyzing the data gathered from
reports about participants versus non-participants, Hollister said.
This strategy ignores underlying factors
and selection bias, Hollister said. "The
groups that you're comparing are really
not truly comparable."

To illustrate this method, Karlan talked
about an experiment he conducted in
South Africa. He sent out several variations of a letter advertising a microcredit
loan.
He found that when the letter included a
picture of a woman along the side, men
were just as likely to make the loan as
when the letter contained no picture, but at

an interest rate that was one-third lower.
David Huffman, a professor and lecture
coordinator for the economics department,
said that Karlan's explanation of nudges
was one of the high points of the lecture.
Karlan used these techniques of behavioral economics, experimentation, and
field application as frameworks for his
research with microfinance in developing
countries as well. In the Philippines,
Bolivia and Peru, the "nudge" of a monthly
reminder to save money increased savings
by six percent.
But Karlan explained that his findings
could not be generalized to all other countries or situations.
"It would be a horrible idea for anybody
with a paycheck. For them, you want to do
a reminder that says, 'don't forget to sign
up for automatic savings,'" he said.

While structural

lies in replication.
"What we really are desperate here for
are a series of these studies in different settings where we can see whether there's
clear pattern," he said.
This approach could help generalize or
contradict Karlan's finding that amongst
South African poor, increased access to
loans led to increased educational attainment and an eight percent reduction in the
poverty headcount ratio.
Huffman invited Karlan to speak at
Swarthmore both because of student interest in development economics and because
of his work's relevance to the research of
other professors in Swarthmore's economics department, Hollister said. Huffman
said in an e-mail that he met Karlan
through a workshop at University College
in London.
Huffman is a behavioral economist, and
Huffman, Hollister and Professor Thomas
Dee do research that involves experiments,
Hollister said.
"Professor Karlan's work is right at the
intersection of all those issues. He goes to
developing countries and uses experiments
to shed light on the sources and potential
solutions to poverty," Huffman said.
Leila Bengali 'IL an economics major,
said that learning about the pros and cons
of the "randomista" perspective was entertaining and interesting.
"I actually didn't know that there was
such a divide in the field," Bengali said.
Kun He Kim 'll, an honors economics
major, agreed that the talk was insightful.
"[The practical economic approach] was
very different than what I learned in the
classroom about economic theories. We
basically learn about the statistical
research methods, but less emphasis is
placed on the field-work-based randomized
control test because it's hard to do as a student," Kim said.
Karlan started his own non-profit organization called "Innovations for Poverty
Action" that works to conduct more experiments like these. He is currently looking

Group aims for $10K in Haiti relief with activities

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY JACQUELINE SMALL

jsmall2@swarthmore.edu

Despite low turn out for its fundraising
events, Coalition for a Free Haiti stands
by its goal of collecting $lO,OOO for Haiti
relief by the end of April.
"The money is going to various organizations," Jacqueline. Bailey-Ross 'lO, the
coalition's co-founder, said in an e-mail .
"We have already sent money to the
Samuel Dalembert Foundation, Doctors
without Borders and will send money to
Partners in Health. Haiti Community
Support is also a large beneficiary of our
funds."
The group has raised about $4,500 so
far. The money has come from Haiti Week
events, which began on April X as well as
fundraising efforts earlier in the semes-

ter.

"I'm hoping that our community will
stand up and empty their pockets in the
spirit of continued activism, to support
this very generous effort," said Darryl
Smaw, interim director of the BCC and
associate dean for multicultural affairs.
He added that he was pleased that other
student organizations were holding
fundraising events of their own for Haiti
relief.
The first event of Haiti Week, which
runs until Sunday, was last Thursday's
benefit concert, "Celebrating a Rich
Culture: A Special Evening for Haiti." The
event raised over $9OO.
Essence of Soul, Sixteen Feet and
Taiko were among the groups that performed. Daniel Chung 10, a member of

Essence of Soul, said, "I felt the concert
went really well, everyone was watching,
and all the performers gave it their all. I
was a little disappointed in the turn out,
but of course* I would say that whether
there were 50 people or 100."
Bailey-Ross called the event "amazing," but also noted that the audience was
small. "A lot of people were probably busy
since it was right before Good Friday,"
she said.
On Saturday, Achieving Black and
Latino Leaders of Excellence hosted the
ABLLE Cup, a series of athletic events
ranging from dodge ball to tug of war
open to teams of students. Both participants and spectators were asked to donate
five dollars.
Jimmy Charite 'll, a member of
ABLLE and Coalition for a Free Haiti,
said, "It was a little disappointing and
only raised $47. Only two teams showed
up and we played two games of kick ball
and had three tugs of war."
On Sunday night, in partnership with
the Global Health Forum, the Coalition
hosted an all-you-can-eat pancake breakfast on Sunday night in Shane Lounge.
The event also raised less than expected,
which Bailey-Ross attributed both to students going home to celebrate Easter and
Passover and to the lack of advertisement.
"We all need to do the advertising, but
we need a more efficient way," BaileyRoss said. At a meeting on Monday, the
Coalition decided to distribute more
posters about upcoming events.
Earlier this week, the group sponsored
a variety of lectures on subjects such as

Students play kickball in Saturday's ABLLE Cup, which was part of Haiti Week.

tomorrow at 8 p.m. There will also be an

international food and culture fair on

The Coalition has also made about 100

AROUND HIGHER EDUCATION

NCAA act may tackle
low graduation rates
BY MEGHAN FARLEY
VILLANOVAN.COM, MAR. 24,
2010
With 16 teams left in the 2010
NCAA tournament, a debate is
stirring about the graduation
rates of student athletes.
U.S. News Weekly writers
Ben Miller and Marc Isenberg
recently
authored articles
debating whether colleges and
universities with low athletic
graduation rates should be
allowed to participate in the
NCAA basketball tournament.
In the battle about what the
term "student-athlete" means,
the NCAA maintains that college athletics are simply college athletics and not the equivalent of minor league sports,
meaning that they should still
be held to some academic standard. U.S.
Secretary
of
Education Arne Duncan supports the plan to penalize
schools whose teams do not
meet the required 33 percent
graduation rate, believing that
they should not be eligible for
the NCAA tournament.
In his article, Miller reported that the NCAA's Academic
Progress Rate plan, if enacted,
would have made 10 teams ineligible for the 2009 tournament.
The Wildcats, however, would
not have been one of those

teams. According to Amy
Morgan, associate director of
Academic Support, Villanova's
most recent graduation success
rate is 96 percent, which
reflects the rates during the
1999-2002 period. Miller reported that the University's graduation rate in 2009 was 92 percent.
"In addition [to academic
advising provided by the
Colleges], Villanova's Office of
Academic Support for Athletes
provides student athletes several programs to help them be
successful, including a freshman mentoring program and a
tutoring program," Associate

Vice President for Academic
Affairs Craig Wheeland said.
The Academic Progress Rate
plan would keep some, but not
all, of the teams out of the tournament. It can be argued that it
would not be devastating to the
tournament itself, as both
Villanova and last year's champion, North Carolina, would
have still qualified for the tournament.

according
However,
to
Robert Schlesinger's March 18
article in U.S. News Weekly,
number one seed Kentucky,
with a 31 percent graduation
rate, would have been one of 12
teams not eligible for the tournament this year.
In addition to prohibiting
teams from participating in the
tournament, an important component of this rule is that it

8

would encourage schools and
student-athletes to take more
steps to prepare academically
for life after their sports
careers come to an end.
Most student-athletes will
not become professionals in
their respected sports, and the
services provided to them by
their schools can help them
prepare for careers.
"Very, very few of our student-athletes will earn a living
playing a professional sport,"
Director of Athletics Vincent
Nicastro wrote in an e-mail.
"This is why we focus on the
academic and intellectual components so much. In addition,
we do offer a number of professional development programs
as part of our Life Skills program
in Athletics. These
include resume preparation,
interviewing skills, business
etiquette dinners and networking."

Nicastro emphasized that it
is important for the University,
the student-athletes and the
coaches to work together in
order to promote the student
athletes' academic success.
"We ensure our student-athletes stay on track by having a
culture that places academics
first and supporting that with
systems such as caring and
understanding faculty, an
Office of Academic Support for
Athletics, mentoring and tutoring programs, etc.," Nicastro
wrote. "You can have all of the
systems and structures in
place, but the most important
factor is that our coaches and
student-athletes understand
and embrace the academic
component of our mission
fully."

Wheeland and
Morgan emphasized that being
a student-athlete is "highly
demanding," but it is possible
to do so at Villanova.
In his U.S. News article,
Isenberg uses the NCAA's definition of "amateur" to argue
that NCAA tournament athletes actually aren't amateurs,
but professionals.
Therefore, graduation rates
should not affect tournament
eligibility because the student
athletes are, in fact, "professionals."
Morgan, on the other hand,
does not agree.
"I do not agree that college
sports are the equivalent of the
minor leagues," Morgan said.
"There is so much more to the
college experience. The opportunity to play sports at the collegiate level is a privilege and
allows students to have experiences they will never have the
opportunity to repeat. These
experiences are not only
involving their sport, but in the
classroom and socially as well."
Nicastro,

STUCO HIGHLIGHTS

StuCo continues discussion of paid positions
StuCo members reported
that the student body has mixed
feelings about paying StuCo
members. Luis Penate 'l3 said
that people he spoke with wondered why StuCo members
would be an "exception" when
other student campus leaders
are not paid. Transparency of
the logged hours was also a concern expressed by the student
body if StuCo members are paid.
Watufani Poe 13 said that "people are very in favor of the idea
of work-study members being
paid" as a way to ensure that
those who wish to run are able
to run.
StuCo is currently working
withthe Dean's Office to develop
a survey for students about the
general effects of work study on
one's
involvement
in
Swarthmore campus activities.
A StuCo forum was held

Tuesday night at 7:30 p.m. in
Kohlberg Coffee Bar. Sonja Spoo
'l3 said that the turnout was

poor, but that the StuCo members that support the payment
movement got a chance to talk
about the reasons behind it.
In addition to ensuring equal
access to StuCo positions for all
of Swarthmore students, Spoo
said that another reason given
to support payment is that
StuCo members serve a role that
is crucial to the school's functioning, mediating between
administration and student-run
groups. Not all StuCo members
are in support ofthe idea.

DREAM Act support
Swatties for a DREAM, an
organization that promotes
national legislation to make
higher education attainable and
affordable for undocumented
youth in the United States,
asked Student Council to write a
resolution in support of the bill.
University
Harvard,
of
Pennsylvania and Temple have
currently endorsed the legisla-

tion, said Evelyn Fraga 13 of
Swatties for a DREAM.
Jusselia Molina 13, another
representative, said that over
300 students have signed the
petition in Sharpies. "It's really
important for Swarthmore to
come out because it fits with our
Swarthmore values of
social
justice, and education is a
human right," said Jovanna
Hernandez 13, also representing
Swatties for a DREAM. StuCo
plans to discuss this action as a
group in further meetings.
...

StuCo leadership retreat
Since Dean of StudentsDesignate Liz Braun expressed
interest in personally meeting
with StuCo prior to the start of
the school year, StuCo has been
working to plan a leadership
retreat for its members during
Orientation Week. StuCo Vice
President Deivid Rojas 11 said
President Rebecca Chopp is supportive of the idea.
Rojas said AssistantDean for
Residential Life Rachel Head
has approved housing for the
program, but the issues of food

and retreat content are still to be
resolved. The retreat might
involve meeting all of the deans
personally, teaching the innerworkings
of
Swarthmore
bureaucracy, and learning how
to run meetings effectively.
Shuttle changes and problems
The ML shuttle schedule
may be restructured before the
end of the school year. The new
system would not involve any

additional shuttles, but would
effectively use the current shuttles to decrease student waittime. StuCo plans to speak with
Acting Dean ofStudents Garikai
Campbell '9O this week.
The new King of Prussia
shuttle has failed to run when
scheduled because of "miscommunications with the shuttle
coordinator," Poe said. Poe recommended sending an e-mail
apology and increasing the
accountability of van drivers.
Election dates
Candidates' announcements
for the upcoming StuCo election
will be published April 12.
StuCo Lounge will be held for
students to learn about the
responsibilities
of various
StuCo positions on April 13 or
14. Candidate platforms will be
due April 19, and a question and
answer session with the candidates will be held on April 22.
Voting will take place from
April 23 until April 28.

Treading the thin line between life and death in film
On Friday, Apr. 2,- The
Phoenix's Maki Somosot interviewed up-and-coming film direc-

tor Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo.
Wojtowicz-Vosloo is the director of
"After.Life," an exploration of the
thin line between life and death,
and what it means to be alive. This

is her first feature film.

Maki Somosot* How did you
come up with the concept for
"After.Life"? How did you develop
the concept into a full-fledgedfilm?
Agnieszka

Wojtowicz-

Vosloo: Since I was a little girl, I
had this fear of death, but also this
strange curiosity about it. My
father died when I was 10 years
old, and that left a very huge
impact on me. Since then, I was
always wondering what happens
after you die if there is a transitional period. I've always won-

dered if there is an afterlife.
MS: You mention a childhood
fascination with death. Could you
talk about how that fed into your
brainstorming process for thefilm?
AWV: Death is still the biggest
taboo. We all wonder, every religion, every philosophy, and sciwe all try to
ence in general
find answers. We don't know,
until we're basically lying on a
slab in a funeral home. That's how
the idea for "After.Life" started. I
started out with this image of
young woman lying on a slab, and
this mortician who's calmly planning her body for the funeral,
when she opens her eyes and says,
"Where am I?" He calmly says,
"You're in a funeral home, you're
dead."

The film is about death and

really, what does it
about life
mean to be alive? If your heart is
beating and your lungs are pumping air, but if you're sleepwalking

through life, mentally and emotionally, are you really alive? I
wanted the film to provoke the
audience to think about their own
lives
When we premiered the
it was so
film at AFI Festival
...

gratifying to me to see and hear
the audience's reactions to it.
The question is: is Anna simply dead and unable to come to
terms with her death and does
Eliot have this gift of transitioning the dead? Or maybe he's in
fact a psychopath who's trying to
teach Anna a lesson and planning
on burying her alive. That's the

mystery of the film.
MS: What do you find most fascinating about the afterlife and
death as a taboo?
AWV: I love how universal
we all think
that question is
about death. It all depends on the
individual. We question our own
mortality. I'm fascinated by how
different religions have a different
concept about the afterlife. For
example, Buddhists believe in this
transitional period. There is a
rule where you're not supposed to
move or disrupt the body for first

72 hours. That's when the process
of the soul leaving your body
takes place. I did a lot of research
in preparation for the film. I went
to many morgues and funeral
homes in New York City. It was a
tough experience, but it was crucial. It helped me tremendously as
a writer and a director. I had to do
it. I had to get really close to it. I

made lots of friends with funeral
directors, and my friends started
getting really worried about it!
MS: That must have been terrifying.
AWV: Yeah, it was. Death is
the primal fear we all have. But I
love working with archetypal, primal fears and feelings. Walking
into a morgue and seeing lots of
young people who are there, and
then walking out into a beautiful
day made me realize how much
potential we all have, and how
people are not realizing their
potential.
MS: / think that's a really optimistic take on the issue. Do you

think there's a difference between
physical death and emotional
death?

cartoon

THE PHOENIX

AWV: Absolutely. The main
character Anna hasn't really lived
life. She is a woman who has a lot
of dreams, potential, talent and
beauty, but because of her
upbringing and her own repression, she's not living life.
Ironically, through death, she
finds life. It's almost like she's
most alive in the preparation
room, while she knows that life
has passed her by. It's this queswhy
tion I often wonder about
do we have to lose something to
want it and miss it?
My father Was only 33 when he
died, but he lived a very full life. If
you love someone, tell them now.
MS: What are your some of
your favorite horrorfilms? How do
you think they influenced your
making of "After.Life"?
AWV: Some of my favorite film
directors in the horror genre are
Roman Polanski, Dario Argento
who's very good with color, David
Kronenberg, like "Crash" and
Hitchcock,
"Dead Ringers,"
especially
"The
Kubrick,
Shining," and Takashi Miike's

"Audition."
This is for other people to
judge, but I'm told that I have a
very original and distinctive
style, and I never try to imitate
anything. I'm very visual as a
filmmaker. I often get compared to
visual filmmakers Tim Burton,
Peter Gillaway, Terry Gilliam. I
love films where you recognize
that this is the work of the same
director it's almost like there is
a clear stamp of identity.
I had a very clear vision from
the moment I started writing the
script. I put together a visual

anchored in the real world. There

is almost very spiritual, with
whites and grays. Anna's character wears the red slip throughout,
red symbolizing love and life and
color of blood. Blood is a visual
motif in the film.
MS: What makes psychological
horror more terrifying than your
typical straight-up zombieflick?
AWV: Psychological elements
make film so much more terrifying. Terror is borne within.
Having a character experiencing
strange things and reacting in
that is scarier
their own way
than a gore fest. There's nothing
more terrifying than psychology.
It's terrifying to imagine to wake
up in a funeral home, and the
funeral director tells you you're
dead, but you feel alive.
MS: How did Liam Neeson,
Christina Ricci and Justin Long's
respective performances match up
with how you envisioned the characters?
AWV: Very close. I love this
idea that an actor brings so much
more to the role, but obviously it
starts with what's on the page.
Liam is all about details. He crafted an amazing character. In one
scene he's so chilling and frightening, and in another scene, he's
gentle and kind and compassionate. He is a very mysterious and

complex

character.

With

Christina, I was looking for an
ethereal beauty. I think she also

related to the character. With
Justin, it's interesting because he

usually does humor roles. I felt
Justin had something very different about him.
MS: Where do you hope to go
next as a filmmaker?
AWV: My tastes are very eclectic, but I always gravitate towards
dark material. I would love to do

another psychological thriller
with horror elements to it. I've
been offered a couple of things
since the film premiered, so I'm
looking into them, and I'll be making my decision after the film
opens. It all starts with the story
for me for me, the genre is secondary. It starts with the story
and the rest comes.
MS: What would be your advice
for young filmmakers/film majors?
AWV: You have to believe in
what you do, otherwise no one
else will. Believe in your material
and your story. Rejection is part of
the business, but don't take it personally and don't give up. It's not
glamorous, it's really hard work.
It takes a specific mindset to do
that.

Tomorrow,
April
9,
Erica
Hawthorne, better know as spoken
word artist RhapsodE, will be sharing
her works and experiences with the
Swarthmore community in honor of
the Kathryn Morgan Poetry Festival.
“Spoken word is a hybrid between
theaterand poetry written for the page,
as well as music. The whole experience
is literally poetry off the page,”
Hawthorne said.
Hawthorne will be incorporating
the spiritual influence of words, music
and the stage for a poetry performance.
The performance will include many
aspects ranging from spirituality, selfdiscovery, womanhood and cultural
dignity mixed with sincerity and
humor. The performance will feature
spoken word and story telling of her
experiences. “There won’t be loud
music, but it will definitely be musical.
The poetry, itself, will tell the story,”
Hawthorne said.
Hawthorne uses her voice and poetry to share tales of struggling women
that focus on bright skies that line the
horizon.
Hawthorne describes her poetry as
having music, even without instruments. It’s in the rhythm and flow of
the delivery. “I believe word has
power,” she said.
Hawthorne started her work as an
artist in Minneapolis, Minnesota,
working alongside well-known artists
such as Desdamona, Divinewords, and
Truthmaze. She now lives in
Philadelphia, having completed work
in African American studies, and continues to perform throughout the city.
Hawthorne’s musical abilities differentiate her from many of her contemporaries. There are times when she
performs with whole bands and other
performances in which she’s solo.
However, even without instrumentalists, the rhythm and flow ofher poetry
create the lyricism of music.
Hawthorne has been featured at festivals, colleges and venues nationwide

10

the
Philadelphia
International
Arts
Expo,
the
Minneapolis B Girl Be Festival and the
Toronto Urban Music Festival. She’s
also performed at local venues including The Black Lily, October Gallery, the
Clef Club and World Cafe Live.
From 2004-2008, Hawthorne worked
at Swarthmore. “I loved working at
Swarthmore, the Lang Center for Civic
Responsibility specifically,” she said.
“Working at Swarthmore showed me
that art is really not far from your life
work. While propping high school students for college, I was able to utilize
performance skills.”
Hawthorne has sponsored fundraising events for the local shelter Women
Against Abuse, Inc. She has also taught

at
both
Swarthmore College and to young
women from upstate New York. She

In Kitao, a celebration of timeless social activism

,
;
.

curated by Swarthmore student
Elizabeth Matlock 'l2. Featuring
the work of political activist and
artist Dorothy Marder, the exhibition included photographs and
activist memorabilia such as tshirts and buttons. The majority
of the works featured were photographs taken by Marder that document political movements like
the anti-nuclear movement, the
lovement, the LGBT
rights movement to the disabilities movement, The exhibition
brought together elements ofhistory, activism and art, exposing
the Swarthmore community to a
body of work that is moving for
both its aesthetic beauty and deep
political message.
Dorothy Marder was a social
realist photographer who actively participated in and documented the political movements of the
19705, 1980s and 19905. Marder's
own personal experiences and

other women and* propelled her
forward to a passionate involvement in activism. "My peace
photos personal and political,
continue to be my labor of love,"
Marder, who died in 2007, said
about her own work.
"She did it because she cared
about it," Matlock said, speaking
about Marder*s reasons for
becoming involved with photography and activism.
This political fervor is apparent in her work, which explores
the humanity of political
activism, many of her images
focusing on a single, anonymous
individual or small group.
Marder captures the emotional
involvement of these individuals
by giving a face and personality
to these political movements.
Matlock discovered Marder's
powerful body of work while
working at the Swarthmore
Peace CoEection. The college

an opportunity to ask them
if they have any food. Instead, I shall try to avoid consuming all of this candy in one sitting (and luckily, my grandmother has discouraged that course ofaction by providing
enough candy to kill me if I were to make such an
attempt).
Because I am the ever-diligent wellness columnist,
absolutely never known to hypocritically ignore my own
advice, I am now wondering what this influx of delicious
sugar will do to my eating habits in the coming weeks.
This unfortunately leads me down the dark road of wondering what my eating habits are in general,,which then
naturally leads me to inquire about the eating habits of
the people around me. While this is not the most cheerful
thought process to experience while facing a large bag of
candy, I'll treat this opportunity that the candy has presented me as an educational experience. Or at least as an
attempt at an educational experience.
College students generally are not known for their
healthy and balanced eating habits (i.e. pizza, Chinese
takeout, caffeine in all shapes and colors). We get to college and take, a stab at feeding ourselves with varied
results. There are a few types of habits that I identify in
my friends. While this list is by no means an exhaustive
description of college eating habits, it's a good place to
start in describing the varieties of ways in which we
attempt to nourish ourselves, and the ways in which we
can improve upon our established eating patterns.

The Busy, Forgetful Eater: Some students are so overscheduled that if they don't literally block out time in
their schedules for meals, then they actuaUy forget to eat.
Don't ask me how this could possibly happen to anyone.
I'm of the "drop everything, it's time for dinner" variety,
so I don't understand this way of eating at all. But it does
bring up an important point. In a sense, all of us could benefit from scheduling our meals in the same way we would
schedule class, meetings and other daily time commitments. It's certainly not healthy to be skipping meals on a
regular basis and we could do our
bodies a huge favor by eating
regularly Our bodies like
to know what to expect.
This applies to sleeping
as well (but I know
what a waste of time it
would be if I tried to
argue
that everyone
should set a nightly bedtime, so I'll stick with eatin
for now).
If you eat at consistent
times every day for each
meal, your body knows
when to anticipate food
and gets hungry accord"

was speaking about food in general, not just sugary items,
but you get the point.
If you're skipping full meals,- make a point of having
snacks on hand to get you through the gaps. Protein is
your best bet in terms of eating to maintain energy for
studying. Nuts, milk, peanut butter, the Nu-Go bars from
Tarble and other protein-filled goodies are some food
items you can reach for in between meal times. This also
goes for late-night snacks as well, especially if you need to
stay up to do work. Caffeine or sugar will only provide a
short burst of energy in comparison to protein, plus
consuming caffeine or sugar within a few
hours of bedtime can interfere with your
ability to fall asleep.
The Athletic Eater: Some of my male
friends are on varsity sports teams and they
seem to eat all the time. For them, eating
goes way beyond meals. They've got good
reasons for their eating habits, a good
amount of food is required to produce
enough energy for all of that daily exercise,
yada yada yada.

But those of us who don't spend at least
two hours a day exercising can learn something from their eating habits as well. Most
of the time, we're stuck in the three-mealsa-day mindset. As in, after dinner, we

Tackling stereotypes with short films
ihanl@swarthmore.edu

Indeed the rumors-are true and the
numerous flyers on campus are not terrible April Fools' Day jokes. Wong Fu
Productions is making a visit to
Swarthmore tomorrow, April 9.
Wong Fu Productions is an independent production company who has
used the resources provided to them by
sites such as YouTube to give voice to
people who may often be overlooked.
"New media gives opportunities to
those who may not have a chance, traditionally, to get mainstream recognition," Alex Ho 'lO, a film and media
studies major, said about the source of
Wong Fu's prominence in web culture.
In the case of Wong Fu, they have
jumped on the YouTube revolution to
pursue what they love to do: making
films and touching lives through these
films.
Through their identity as Asian
Americans, they open up the dialogue
on Asian stereotypes in the media and
furthering the growing presence of
Asians in mainstream media.
Wong Fu's first video dates back to
2003
when then University
of
California San Diego undergraduate
student Philip Wang made a music
video with his friends of Justin
Timberlake's "Senorita." It was in 2004,
when Wang met Ted Fu and Wesley

12

Chan, that the three went on to work

together to create more music videos
and to collaborate on humorous and
touching short films.
In 2006, they released their first fulllength feature film, "A Moment With

The film centers on the protagonist's attempts to figure out why all his
Asian female friends are more fixated
on his white roommate than on him.
He struggles with the issue before
being told off by his Indian friend who
tells him how good Asians have it compared to Indians. This friend also provides the explanation that Asians tend
to not have enough confidence to get

Asian but still struggle to find a true
identity as just an American.
Asian Americans, like other minorities, are always Asian Americans and
rarely ever just American. It is this
struggle that is manifested by Wong
Fu's presence in media and culture.
"Wong Fu explores Asian stereotypes and they try to play down these
stereotypes," Judy Diep 'l3, one of the
organizers of the event, said. "I hope
the campus can see how these stereotypes are portrayed in the media and
how not all Asians are that way."
In addition to exploring Asian
stereotypes in their short films, they
promote up-and-coming Asian artists
by helping to produce their music.
Some of the artists they have supported
have been David Choi and Far East
Movement. They also set up concerts,
under the moniker International
Secret Agents that try to increase
awareness of Asian music.
Wong Fu Productions is a growing
production company that extends perhaps beyond just promoting Asian
American representation in media to
just being a group that in essence is
doing what they love.
Their motto goes, "If at the end of
the day there's someone out there who
has a better day because of us, then
we've

Fu
Productions are, in essence, hard at

Checkpoint furthers visibility of conflict, spurs discussion
For three days this week, the campus organization Students for Peace
and Justice in Palestine simulated a
barrier between Israel and the West
Bank by erecting a wall in front of
Parrish Hall. The event was a controversial start to three days of activities
relating to the Middle Eastern conflict. Both online and in letters to The
Phoenix, members of the community
have expressed their disagreement
with the intent and execution of this
event. While it is understandable that
the simulation offended some, we
believe that it is often impossible for
effective activism to avoid being offensive. The simulation is not egregious
or insensitive and we are impressed
that it has gotten the campus talking.
When discussing any conflict, it is
important to consider the perspective
of all sides involved. This has been
stressed many times in relation to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and it is
easy to dismiss the wall as a one-sided
and biased view of checkpoints and
barriers in Israel. The simulation is
not a comprehensive image of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but it is
not intended to be.
Working to resolve a conflict as
complicated as the one between Israel
and Palestine inevitably involves raising awareness and fostering understanding through discussion and
debate. We all know the merits of honest and respectful discussion as a tool
for fostering understanding. As we are
also aware, however, discourse alone
often leaves much to be desired.
Holding campus meetings for those
interested in the conflict will surely
spark discussion, but only among
those few who are able and willing to
attend. The barrier simulation shows
that this form of activism, even when
initiated by a group with obvious sympathy for the Palestinian cause, spurs
conversation more effectively than
less visible events such as round-table
discussions, or film screenings.
The wall went up at the close of
Passover, which was unfortunate.
Regardless of whether the organizers
consciously planned this timing, the
unfortunate side effect was that it
alienated many of those people who
should be part of the discussion on the
conflict. This could and should have
been avoided. But if the wall offends
for what it represents, rather than for
its awkward timing, that could not
have been avoided. In fact, the power
of the simulation is largely derived
from the prominence of the wall and
the difficulty of ignoring it. That said,
the organizers of this event made
laudable efforts to lessen the hurt that
the wall instigates by placing signs
that warn people exiting Parrish Hall
of the ongoing event.
The discomfort that the wall has
created among some can and should
be used in productive ways. Calling
for free and open debate is all well and
good, but it rarely provokes direct
confrontation and a solid debate about
the most contentious issues. We may
not expect to solve difficult problems

THE PHOENIX

merely by parrying difficult questions. The simulation, though, is a
complement to discussion. It portrays
a situation facing people who live
under difficult circumstances and
have substantially restricted freedom
of movement. Rather than abstract
debate, the wall in front of Parrish
makes the situation concrete and
helps us, if only ever so slightly, to
imagine the hardships that those
involved in the conflict face.
Strikingly, the response to the barrier simulation shows us that strong
activism at the college is limited for
fear of dividing the community. We
often talk about living in a bubble,
insulated from many of the problems
of the outside world. Students are concerned about queer rights, the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan, and Americans'
lack of health insurance, but the
debates that often attempt to address
these problems, including the debate
on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
become abstract and vague. This
week's barrier simulation is different
because it encourages students to
imagine the emotional and physical
pain of the conflict. It is a striking
demonstration of how virtual confrontation can be both upsetting and
incredibly useful in student activism.
For this reason alone the simulation
was worth holding.
Overall, we appreciate the effect
that the barrier simulation has had on
fostering discussion about the conflict
so far and we suspect that many members of the community agree with us.

with the simulation, however, can use

Checkpoint simulation not handled tactfully
To the Editor,
I would like to start by stating that
I am representing my opinion and
only my opinion. My words are my
own.
I don't know how I feel about the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I am
Jewish on my mother's side but consider myself a cultural/ethnic Jew
rather than a religious one. I have
family in Israel so I am sympathetic
toward their desire to live peaceful
lives and concerned for their well
being. That being said, my family
went through the Holocaust and an
era where their freedoms were
restricted and they were not treated as
equal citizens in the place they considered their homeland. While the two
situations are obviously different, I
feel I can be empathetic towards
Palestinians whose personal freedoms
have been violated.
Regardless of my feelings on the
conflict, this event was not handled
well. Clearly the administration provided guidance on this event (facilities
helping set up the gate, someone in the
group mentioning the timing kept getting pushed back).

Someone should have been aware

that this event is taking place at the
tail end of Passover, one of the most
important holidays in the Jewish calendar. While I know it was not meant
this way, the way the event was handled feels to me like an attack. Being
Jewish does not equate to being proIsrael, but the administration did not
sufficiently take into account the
impact this would have on the Jewish
community.
One of the other issues I have is the
secrecy that surrounded the checkpoint. I understand that the secrecy
was meant to further the impact, but I
feel that it was vastly inappropriate
for the checkpoint to go up without
warning. Since I didn't have the
opportunity to prepare myself, my
first reaction was one of hurt. When I
feel attacked, I react defensively. I
would have appreciated the time to
process this and prepare a response
more conducive to discourse.
I am not objecting to the days of
awareness, not even specifically to the
checkpoint. I am objecting to the
secrecy, the timing and the one-sided
point of view. This conflict is not onesided, nor is it even two-sided. I
believe this is a multidimensional con-

April 8, 2010

flict that should be represented as
such. I know there will be an open discussion that I would like to attend
pending my time availability, but I do
not feel this is enough. I would like to
see multiple points of view represented.
I do not think the students who
organized Three Days in Palestine
were intending to offend anyone. I
believe that the comments on the
Daily Gazette that call Swarthmore
students "terrorists" are extremely
offensive. I believe the students were
trying to inspire reflection and dialogue; in that vein, I think we should
reflect and have open dialogue. I hope
that this does not become a polarizing
issue.
Furthermore, we should discuss
how events such as these are organized and sanctioned by the administration. I don't know what transpired
within the administration, but it
should have been handled more carefully with more transparency.
Despite my reservations about the
way this was handled, I hope we can
learn as campus community and move
forward constructively.

Suzie and I
were in the
family line; it held couples and carriages filled with infants and vegetables. We were traveling with the
Friday shopping crowd that had gone
to the market in Nablus.
The soldiers for our line were divided into two orderly groups. One directed the flow of traffic and checked IDs.
Another operated behind shatterproof
glass, commanding the other soldiers
and scrutinizing the lines for unusual

movement.

Suzie and I approached the checkpoint the way we approached every

security check in the West Bank:
Follow the person in front of you and
be unobtrusive. It took the soldiers
manning the checkpoint half an hour
(and halfway through the line) to
notice us. When they did, a nervous
flurry of Hebrew went back and forth
over walkie talkies: "What are those
two girls doing in there? What's with
the
blonde?
They're
probably
Americans." After a pause, a man's
voice: "Pass them through."
For this, a soldier had to leave the
bulletproof section. She suited up in
extra padding and put on a spacemanlike helmet. As I watched the helmet
go over her long, black dreadlocks, I
couldn't help but smile. Even the
Israelis who serve in combat units
think they're peace-loving hippies.
And a traveler would be wrong to conclude that it's all aesthetics.
The 19-year-old girl walked out of
the enclosure with a semi-automatic
on her hip and blue fear in her eyes.
She called us over to the front, looked
at our passports, asked "American?"
and said, "It's fine. You can go through
now."
Next, we passed through the notorious Qalandia checkpoint on the way to
Jerusalem. Qalandia is a scary airport-like terminal of iron bar queues
that feel like claustrophobic cages.
Being American, though, made it akin
to a simulation.
Our journey ended by the Western
Wall; Jerusalem was in the midst of a
festive Shabbat. Hundreds ofOrthodox
men in felt black hats milled about,
praying and dancing in the summer
sunset. I pondered, in whose name
were the security measures installed?
While I didn't see anything other
than calm ID checks at both, the arbitrary nature of the checkpoints makes
them all the more horror-filled. One
day you might wait in a maddeningly
long line, one day a shorter one. One
day you may receive a perfunctory
pass-through, the next a humiliating
interrogation.
A demonstration such as the wall

simulation provides

many fruitful

opportunities to retreat back into our
clannish tendencies, so I hope you'll

forgive my biased musings. At the
Swarthmore wall (supposed to simulate the Huwwara checkpoint), what
humiliated me the most was seeing the
white t-shirts Sharpied with "Israeli
Defense Forces." I found myself overly
concerned with how the actors played
their roles: Were they too mean? How
often did they succumb to puffed-up
displays of machismo?
I think the point of this demonstration, though, was to highlight the
experience of the Palestinians: the
restriction and slowing of travel, the
fetters on the real human need to live
a life full of family, learning, love and
happiness.
However, I'm only human and it
hurts me to see Israeli teenagers portrayed like they were, when so much
of what I know about them is good.
Their incredible charisma, pursuit of
light-hearted fun, strong work ethic,
and yes, intense thought about their
ethical dilemmas, characterizes them
in my mind.
The problem is, you can't ask outsiders to see what you love about a
people. Until Israel finds a way to end
the occupation, people who love it will
always be subjected to this kind of
pain. The checkpoint simulation
shows
the
campus
how
the
Palestinians, and heck, much of the
rest of the world, sees Israel. They'll
never have pathos on their side. But
the whole sympathy currency takes
me back to the Second Intifada: Must
Israel pay with a showcase of Jewish
blood for the world's sympathy?
Was the simulation an attempt to
spark sheer emotion and identification with the Palestinians? Perhaps,
but I don't see this as a bad thing. The
emotions we felt were real, necessary
and good. They were feelings of compassion.

In that vein, it is the duty of every
to travel the
West Bank on Palestinian roads and
buses. Until you do, you don't have a
"complex view of the conflict." If you
can't visit, watch YouTube videos, look
at Google images or photo-stories (I
can give you some high-quality, fairly
objective ones if you like).
Many people who care about Israel
feel deeply uncomfortable about the
occupation. The question should be,
what are the people who love Israel
doing to help it leave the West Bank?
How are they keeping Israel honest?
The new group J-Street seems promising. And just to be clear, the proPalestinian movement needs to ask
itself similar soul-searching questions
and do similar work.
On college campuses, the checkpoints seem like a point of agreement
and a way forward in collaboration.
Can the pro-Palestinian movement in
America put forward a plan of action
that the pro-Israel left can rally
around? Collaboration in the middle
seems to me to be a crucial aspect of
the success or failure anti-occupation
activism in America.
I think that SPJP gave a good start
on Monday. If you feel you have to do a
protest such as this (which, as we've
seen, tends to drive people away from

the middle), this was absolutely the
best one. I wish there had been a camera crew to document this and show it
to pro-Palestinian activist groups
around the country. This impressive
feat of leadership and testament to the
maturity of its members should be celebrated.
And for anyone looking to emulate
or judge: participation was entirely
optional and signs were erected
around the area with warnings. They
didn't target the Israeli people or
Jews, simply a government's system.
There were no problematic allusions
and I didn't see a single Magen David.

leanings.
A reminder: Come to Kohlberg
Coffee Bar, tonight (Thursday), at 8
p.m. to chat about leaving the bickering behind and creating measurable
impacts.
One final thought. The checkpoint
simulation posited a question: At what
cost is a state allowed to promote its
citizens' security? In answering this,
we shouldn't determine that emotions
are conclusive above all else. The most
powerful, yet limiting, truism about
personal experience is that there is
always another.

STUDENT-ATHLETE Q&A

AROUND COLLEGIATE SPORTS

Students first, athletes second Travis Pollen, Swimmer
BY DAILY TITAN EDITORIAL BOARD
DAILY TITAN ONLINE, MAR. 23, 2010
The California Golden Bears started
their game against the Louisville
Cardinals, March 19, on a 12-0 run and
never looked back, defeating Louisville
77-62 and eliminating them from the
NCAA Tournament.
If it were up to U.S. Secretary of
Education Arne Duncan, both teams
would have been eliminatedbefore they
even got a chance to lace up their
Nikes.
Duncan is suggesting that teams that
do not graduate at least 40 percent of
their players be banned from postseason play.
This year, that would have kept 12 of
the 65 teams in the tournament from
participating, including one-seeded
Kentucky. Maryland had the lowest
rate of any tournament team, posting
only an eight percent graduation rate.
Washington,
Tennessee,
Baylor,
Arkansas-Pine Bluff, Clemson, Georgia
Tech, New Mexico State and Missouri
also failed to graduate 40 percent of
their players.
Those numbers are astonishingly
low, considering that the vast majority
of college basketball players will never
play a game in the NBA.
The NCAA uses a different formula
to calculate graduation rates, excluding
players who leave early to turn professional, drop out or transfer. However,
using this formula produces only slightly better results.
Rather than the 43 percent average
calculated using Duncan's formula, the
average graduation rate for last year's
tournament teams was 59 percent. That
still leaves two out of five players fail-

sense for some of the older players, but
with today's multi-million dollar
salaries and potential endorsement
funds, there is no excuse for losing all
that money.
It seems it may be beneficial for students to actually learn something while
in school, including players who are
high NBA prospects.
Unfortunately, some people think
Duncan is confusing college academics
with college sports. There is a growing
belief that college basketball players at
schools such as Kansas and Kentucky
should be considered professionals.
Stripping players of their amateur
status is merely a simple solution to the
graduation rate problem; the players
are still amateur athletes. Going to a
"basketball school", such as Duke or
University of California Los Angeles,
does not give athletes professional sta-

tus.

In fact, two well-known basketball
programs have been able to maintain
extremely high graduation rates and a
high level of performance on the court.
Villanova, which made it to the Final
Four last season, had a graduation rate
of 92 percent, and national champion
North Carolina had a graduation rate
above 75 percent.
It is time to start imposing harsher
penalties and encouraging education.
NCAA teams that do not maintain a 40
percent graduation rate should be ineligible for postseason play. The rule is
not meant to hurt the teams that narrowly miss the cut, but punish the
teams that place little to no value on
education.
The win-first mentality does not
work. It has resulted in lower academic
standards for student-athletes and oncourt penalties. Memphis had its Final

the finals of the 100 free. It was my
last race, and although I was seeded
first, the other top guys had taken it
really easy that morning, so I knew
they'd be coming for me at night."

MM: "Which event(s) did you want
to especially win? Was there one in
particular that you had set a bar
for?"
TP: "Going into the meet, I actually
had no idea that I'd be winning any
races. I just wanted to be competitive with the guys who swam in
Beijing two summers ago. My
biggest goal was to make the qualification standard times for the
World Championships {which I
ended up falling short of by half a
second in the 50 and about a second
in the 100). I also really just wanted
to get my fastest times and meet the
seed times that I had entering the
meet, which were my yards times

formula. When I posted the fastest
time in prelims of* the 50 free by a
second, I knew that I had a great
chance at winning the race that
night, and I did! And being the

No need for additional
teams in the Big Dance
BY JOSH KATZENSTEIN
MINNESOTA DAILY ONLINE,
APR. 5, 2010
Look, it's a foregone conclusion
that if the Division I Men's Basketball
Committee wants to expand the Big
Dance to 96 teams, then it's going to
happen.
And since it appears that the
change is inevitable, I might as well
say why it's a terrible, horrible, no
good, very bad idea.
Before I get into the good stuff, let
me mention this is being written
before Monday night's championship
game, so if I make it sound like Duke
will triumph, that's because I picked
the Blue Devils to win it all (in each of
my pools).

The NCAA men's basketball tournament is perfect in its current structure. It gives enough teams that don't

have a legitimate title chance the
opportunity to prove they belong
(Ohio vs. Georgetown, anyone?).
People complained in the past when
the field expanded, and those same
people and their children are already
indignant about further expansion.

least 15 points.
This means at
least 11 teams
had no real
chance at winning the title. Sprinkle a few more
blowouts over the course of the tournament, and it's quite clear that there
were a maximum of 10 teams (I
would've said five if Butler hadn't
proven everyone wrong) that actually
had a shot at cutting down the nets in
Indianapolis.

The other major problem I see is
that the change might just scrap the
National Invitation Tournament and
give most of those teams spots in the
NCAA tournament.
North Carolina, this year's NIT
runner-up, lost by 10 points to Duke at
home and by 32 on the road. Can you
make an argument that the Tar Heels
could have won a game in the NCAA
tournament? Sure.
Can you make an argument that the
Tar Heels had a shot at the title?
Absolutely not.
"I don't see any watering down at
all," Minnesota head coach Tubby
Smith said in an April 2 Associated
Press story. "I think there are a number of teams playing in the NIT that
could have gotten in, and I think there
will be more people and more excitement with more teams in."
I have to say I'm a little disappointed Smith feels this way, because
adding 32 more teams does water
down the tournament.
If 96 teams can say they accomplished something that formerly only

THE PHOENIX

65 teams could claim, then it does
become less important. Period.
So many teams would be able to
hang banners year after year that having a consecutive-tournaments-made
streak would be essentially meaningless.
This year's tournament will likely
help the committee pass an amendment to expand. If No. 5-seeds like
Michigan State and Butler can
advance to a Final Four, then it's certainly conceivable that other lower
seeds could shock the world. The
lower seeds also helped spike TV ratings to their highest level in five
years. People love underdogs and feelgood stories.
"It's not going to ruin the tournament," ESPN college basketball analyst Jay Bilas said in an interview
with SportsCenter's Josh Elliott lasi

Green Terror tops lacrosse team
The Swarthmore men's lacrosse
team traveled to McDaniel to face the
GreenTerror this past Saturday after a
layoff of nearly a week from play. The
team was originally scheduled to play
the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at
home on Wednesday, but the game was
postponed because of the death of a

USMMA student-athlete.
The extended break from play seems
to have hurt the Garnet men, as they
were outshot by the Green Terror 14-8
and outscored 5-1 in the first quarter.
Despite settling down on offense, another strong third quarter for McDaniel
propelled them past Swarthmore, as the
Garnet fell 15-9 to move to 1-7 overall for
the season, and winless in conference
play. The Centennial' Conference features two of the league's strongest men's
lacrosse teams, with Gettysburg as of
April 6 ranked at #2 and Dickinson
ranked at #5.
Despite whatthe score suggested, the
Garnet were able to match the Green
Terror equally in most facets of the
game. The Swarthmore men fired off
one more shot, and fired only three
fewer shots on goal. They also scooped
up only four fewer groundballs, won
nearly halfof the face-offs, and were able
to clear the ball on 18 of their 21
attempts. The Garnet men even commit-

ted fewer turnovers and penalties, losing the ball 19 times compared to the 21
turnovers committed by McDaniel, and
giving up four fewer extra-man opportunities.
The few extra shots on goal by the
Green Terror were enough to give them
the game, despite goals from starting
attackmen Tyler Bradshaw 10, Zach
Belden 'l2 (2) and Gavin Musynske 'lO
(2), as well as starting midfielder Wes
Marcik 'l3 (2).
Anthony Phalen 10 and Kevin Pytlar

Track & field athletes set
to compete at conferences
BY MARCUS MELLO

mmello2@swarthmore.edu

April 3 was a successful day for the
Garnet men's and women's track & field
teams. Twelve athletes from both teams
five men and seven women booked spots
for the Centennial Conference championships by earning qualifying marks in
their respective events at the Osprey
Invitational. The meet, which was held at
Richard Stockton College of New Jersey
and included athletes from over 10 schools,
featured strong performances from the
underclassmen especially.
According to head coach Pete Carroll,
who has held this position for the past nine
years, qualifying for the conference championships takes a performance at or
beyond the peak of some athletes' abilities,
and is a significant accomplishment. But
for others, he said, it is a forgone conclusion. "Bottom-line, no one wants to be on
the sidelines when we host conferences this
year.". Carroll said that the teams had
pleasant surprises in the throwing events
and some narrow misses in the sprints.
Chris Wickham 'l2 was one of the runners who performed exceptionally well for
the Garnet. Wickham crossed the finish
line in 10:27.98 to capture a first place finish
in the 3000-meter steeplechase, a hybrid
distance and hurdling event that includes
both ordinary barriers and water jumps.
Wickham, who only started running yearround in college, dominated the field of racers, winning the race by over 20 seconds.
"Steeplechase is probably my best event,
although I enjoy the"sK more," Wickham
said. "This is the first time I've placed first
at a track invitational at Swarthmore, or
any race at Swat, for that matter."
The next highest finisher for the men's
team was Chris Mayer-Bacon 11, who ran
59.78 to take Bth place in the 400-meter hurdles.
First-years Aidan DuMont-McCaffrey
and Matthew Heck also made Centennial
Conference qualifying times in the 800meter run and 200-meter dash, respectively.
DuMont-McCaffrey finished 13th of 30 runners in 2:06.47, while Heck was 16th out of
33, clocking in a time of 23.65
a whole second faster than his previous personal best.
As a first-year, Heck is excited to have qualified for Conferences in the 200-meter dash,
but a little surprised. "My main event
throughout high school was the 400-meter
dash and I rarely ran the 200 meter dash
...

Consequently, I really expected to qualify
in the 400 instead," Heck said. Although
somewhat disappointed with his 400-meter
dash and legs in the 4xloo and 4x400 at the
Osprey Invitational, Heck is optimistic for

Conferences.
The final runner to achieve a qualifying
conference time for the men was distance
runner Zach Gershenson 'l2 in the 5000meter run (17:1172). His time was fast
enough to earn him a 7th place finish.
For the women, the star performer on
the day was captain Lauren DeLuca 'lO.
DeLuca led the Garnet women at the invitational in the 1500-meter run with a time of
4:53.24. DeLuca was content with her performance as she crushed her personal best
time. "I am actually pretty impressed with
how I ran on Saturday. I beat my old personal record [for the 1500] by 11 seconds, so
it felt good to get underfive minutes for the
first time."

SPORTS IN BR |EF^HHHH^HB| |^aH^HHI

Softball team in playoff contention

DeLuca's second place finish was followed by third and fourth place finishes
from her teammates Rebecca Hammond 'l3
(4:54.81) and Katie Gonzalez 'l2 (5:06.23).
DeLuca recognized her teammates' laudable performances. "I was really proud of
Rebecca [Hammond] on Saturday. She had
never run the 1500 before, but she trusted
herself to push it harder than I think anyone expected for her first 1500. The same
thing for Katie [Gonzalez], who hadn't run
the event in a year
both of their performances blew us all away."
The Garnet women also had conference
qualifying times in the 800-meter run, the
400-meter hurdles, and the javelin. Seniors
Erin Ronhovde and Mariel Feigen each
placed third in their respective events,
Ronhovde crossing the finish line in 2:26.82
in the 800-meter run and Feigen completing
the 400-meter hurdles in 1:12.52. Javelin
throwers Sarah Diamond 'l3 and Naomi
Glassman 'l2 were the women's final two
conference qualifiers. Diamond's 19.36meter throw captured her sixth place and
Glassman came in eighth with a throw of
18.33 meters.

DeLuca further acknowledged the performances of the first-years and sophomores as a positive sign for the future. "I
definitely see our team building up thanks
to the freshmen and sophomores. On the
women's side, we're really strengthening
our middle distance and sprint teams. Our
throwers too are improving every week
so our future looks pretty bright with the
current underclassmen."
One significant factor affecting the
teams' performance is the weather. Coach
Carroll said that the Garnet runners
enjoyed the best weather the meet has seen
in five years. When asked if practices have
been improving with the conditions,
Carroll explained that bad weather forces
the teams into the field house. "The track
in there has very tight turns and is hard on
the legs; we have a lot of injuries with the
sprint group because of it. The hot weather
favors the sprinters and field events; the
cooler weather favors the distance athletes."
DeLuca said that track "just feels better" now that the weather has become more
pleasant. "It's easier in my opinion to get a
good workout in under these conditions."
DeLuca believes that the teams can take
advantage of the change in weather to
focus on solid workouts and improve
before the Conference meet at the end of
the month.
Outside the meets, the track
field
teams are also fun and cohesive units.
Heck, who runs the 200- and 400-meter
dashes and is a member of two relay teams,
describes the team as "very close and very
reliable."
Heck did not plan to continue running
competitively when applying to colleges,
but he said that he is glad he is part of the
team. "At first, I was a little bit hesitant
about participating in a sport because I was
so used to my high school team and didn't
think a college team could be nearly as
crazy or as fun.
It turns out that
Swarthmore's team is crazier and more
fun."
With many Garnet track & fieldathletes
having qualified for Conferences, the men's

tory for the Swarthmore Garnet softball
team in 2009 came on April 25 in the
penultimate doubleheader of the year.
By that time, the team had fallen out of
playoff contention. But Swarthmore finished the season with a doubleheader
sweep of McDaniel and headed into the
2010 campaign
with Centennial

Conference momentum.
Now, following back-to-back doubleheader splits with Gettysburg and
Muhlenberg, two playoff caliber teams
in the Centennial Conference,
Swarthmore is in the heart of the
Conference playoff push. Following
Tuesday's victory in the second game of
a doubleheader from Allentown,
Swarthmore sits just one game out of
the Conference playoff picture. The win
was the Garnet's third of Conference
play this season with 10 games against
Conference foes still remaining.
The defeat of Muhlenberg comes on
the heels of an impressive win over
Gettysburg in the first game of a doubleheaderlast Saturday. Behind the stellar pitching of Katherine Riley 10, who
held the Bullets to five hits while striking out six in a complete game,
Swarthmore came away victorious by a
final of 3-2. Danielle Seltzer 13, who continues to tear up Centennial pitching,
blasted a two-run home run to centerfield in the bottom of the first inning.
She finished one-for-two in the game
with two RBIs and two runs scored.
In the second game of the doubleheader, the Garnet and Bullets were tied
after seven innings of play with Riley
and Laney Parr of Gettysburg engaged
in a pitching duel. After nine innings of
play and the game still tied, the
International Tie-Breaker Rule, starting
each inning with a runner on second
base, went into effect, and Gettysburg
took advantage to clinch the game 7-4.
On Tuesday, the outcomes were
reversed, as Swarthmore dropped the

.April 8, 2010

close opener 2-0. The Mules scored both
of their runs in the bottom of the fourth
inning on a suicide squeeze and a
throwing error. The Garnet was held to
four hits.
In game two, the bats came alive
with the Garnet pounding out nine hits
and nine runs through the first four
innings to open up the 9-0 lead. But the
Mules would come storming back, scoring two in the fourth and five in the
sixth before Swarthmore held on for the
9-7 victory.

Krista Scheirer 11 had a big afternoon at the plate for the Garnet, finishing the second game with three hits and
three RBIs. Elizabeth Cushing 'l2 also
had two RBIs in the second game.
Swarthmore has continued to
progress since returning from their
Spring Break Trip, where the team won
zero games and lost six. The victory
over the Mules, the defending
Centennial Conference Champions, is
just the latest in a string of strong performances that, have moved the Garnet
into seventh in the Conference.
Gettysburg and Muhlenberg, currently
tied for fourth in the Centennial, hold 44 Conference records. Washington is 3-3.
For the young softball team, the constant improvement is a sign of increasing maturity as the team moves through
the Conference season. Communication
has been a focus from the start of the
season both on the bench and on the
field, and under the tutelage of the
Garnet upperclassman, the first-years
and their fellow underclassmen have
begun to shine.
Swarthmore returns to action today
as they host Arcadia for a non-conference doubleheader. Swarthmore will
then return to the road to face McDaniel
College on Saturday, a team against
which the Garnet has won six of eight
games, including the season-ending
sweep last year. McDaniel is 1-3 on the
season.
