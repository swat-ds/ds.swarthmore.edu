U.S. Election Results: Not Much Has Changed
GOP candidates win
Delaware County, despite
Borough's liberal votes
By Sylvia

Weedman

Having finally concluded the last campaigns of their respective careers, President Bill Clinton and former Senator Bob
Dole returned to their home states on Tuesday and wearily voted for themselves.
The two candidates brought an end to a
campaign season that many of us feared
would never end. But they finished well,
reaching the last of their campaign stops
with unshaken enthusiasm just hours before the polls opened.
Dole managed to capture the electoral
votes of a wide swath of the Midwest from
Texas to the Dakotas, as well as six states
in the South, but Clinton won everything
else, including all of the West Coast and
everything north of Maryland in the East.
For Dole, this is the end. He conceded
the race with integrity and encouraged his
supporters to "keep fighting the good
fight." For Clinton, this is an opportunity
to reinvent himself and his vision of government one last time. Facing the imminent resignations of Secretary of State
Warren Christopher, Defense Secretary
William Perry, and acting CommerceSecretary Mickey Kantor, he will need to find
new faces for his new Administration very
soon.

For us, not much has changed. Both
houses of Congress are still controlled by
the Republicans, and Newt Gingrich will
resume his position as Speaker of the
House in the 105th Congress. In total, the
Republicans gained two seats in the Senate and lost nine seats in the House. Longstanding Republican Senators JesseHelms
and Strom Thurmond retained their seats,
as did Democratic Senators Paul Wellstone
and John Kerry.
After a particularly bitter race, Democrat Bob Torricelli of New Jersey beat out
Dick Zimmer for Bill Bradley's Senate
spot. And after one of the more poignant
races of the year, Democrat Carolyn
McCarthy beat Republican Representative Dan Frisa of New York. McCarthy,
whose husband was shot and killed on a
Long Island commuter train, took issue
withFrisa for opposing the assault weapons ban.
Closer to home, incumbent Republican
Curt Weldon won the 7th District House
seat over Democrat John Innelli with twothirds ofDelaware County's votes. Neighboring Springfield voted overwhelmingly
Republican again this year, although the
borough of Swarthmore significantly favored both Clinton and Innelli.
A few races are still being contested,
but for the most part, the political scene is
quiet. We as voters can sit back and contemplate the issues for a little while until
the 105th Congress convenes, Clinton is
re-inaugurated, and the real politicking
begins.

mittee (SAC) to obtain funds to sponsor an
All-Campus party. No part of this funding
may be used to purchase alcoholic beverages." At most free parties, however, alcohol
is readily available. Assuming that the cost of
these beverages is not coming out of students' own pockets, it appears that SAC funds
are in fact being used to obtain alcohol.
SAC co-coordinators Tanisha Little '97
and Aisha Moss-Koonce '97 said: "The rule
is that you can't use SAC money to buy
alcohol. But people always find a way around
that."Little and Moss-Koonce felt there was
little they could do to curb the situation. "We
don't consider ourselves to be the alcohol
police of the campus... we're college-age
people. People drink." SAC rules also do not
allow for the sponsoring of private parties.
In orderfor a party to receive funding, the
people throwing a party must present Little a
receipt. "We do not accept any receipts that
have alcohol on them," she said. Besides
Moss-Koonce and Little, who is treasurer for
Budget Committee, only assistant treasurers
Brian Bell '99 and Charity Miller '9B have
access to the receipts. Said Jessica McFarland
'9B, "I'm on Budget Committee, and I've
never seen one of those receipts."
Some receipts, like those of Swarthmore
Beverage, feature categories like "soda"
which allow students, if so inclined, to conceal the true nature of their purchases. Liule
feels that she is unable to challenge receipts
that include vague categories: "When people
give me their receipts, I do check them over.
But when they give me a receipt from Swat
Bev that says 'food' or 'soda,' $95.00,1 don't
call Swat Bev to check. We do our best with
the situation...l'm not going to go to Swat
Bev every time someone has a party to check
up on them."
Associate Dean Tedd Goundie said the
Deans didn't know much about the misallocation of funds. "We've certainly heard rumors that it happens, but we don't know the
degree...This is expressly prohibited. This
definitely couldbe adjudicable." If there were
evidence offalsified receipts, he said, it would
be a matter best handled by the College judicial system. Goundie added that as far as he
knew, nothing like this had ever been adjudicated by the College, but if he heard more
about it, he certainly would push for adjudication of offenders.
Given Goundie's words, unsurprisingly,
no one who threw a SAC-funded party came
forward to talk to The Phoenix.
Goundiesaid that up until around 1989,the
College had spent money on alcohol for student parties. However, with the tightening of
federal regulations, especially with the passage of the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act, the College was forced to take
official steps against underage drinking on
campus. "Three-quarters of the campus is
underage," said Goundie, and Federal law
requires that the College not do anything to
encourage consumption of alcohol by minors. Such a money trail might leave the
College vulnerable to a lawsuit as well,
Goundie noted.
In the end, Little places blame squarely on
students who throw parties and knowingly
break the rules. "We put people on their
honor. We tell them the rules, we give them
the money, then they give us the receipt.

sions staff and I sat down to evaluate the
dropping of our second [winter] early decision deadline, and we reached the conclusion
that we wanted to reinstate it.
"We decided to [do this], because we noticed that many students who did not have
access to strong college counseling in their
schools or communities were not prepared to
choose one school as their first choice by
November."
According to Mamlet the decision was an
effort to reach out to a wider range of prospective students. She emphasized that the
winter early decision plan was reinstated as a
means to "provide the same option to all our
applicants, no matter what kind ofassistance
is available to them as they move through

their college search."
"Regular decision," Mamlet explained, "[is]
the way in which, historically, roughly threequarters of our entering students apply. Application deadline is January 1; notification is
by April 1; students have until May 1 to let us
know whether or not they're coming."
Early decision, she said, is for students
who know Swarthmore is their first choice
and who are willing to enter into a binding
agreement to enroll at the College if they are

accepted.
For many years, Swarthmore offered two
different early decision deadlines—one on
November 15 with notification received by
December 15; the second on January 1 with
notification by February 1.

SC to Increase Oversight

of Committees

Student Council met with its appointees to various College
committees on Wednesday, November 6. Among the topics discussed at the meeting was a new method of reporting, which
required each committee delegation to send a number of reports to
the Appointments Committee, apparently to avoid any major surprises over the course of the term, and allowing Student Council to
have greater oversight ofthe various committees. This measure was
approved by all of student council, with the exception of Rachel
Henighan '97, who wanted to see the entire Council involved in the
oversight process, and not just the Appointments Committee.

Students Respond to Hate Speech
A number of individuals drafted a letter to the entire campus on
Wednesday evening, condemning the thoughts behind the recent
incidents of hate speech and race and sexual-preference related
tensions. The letter will be presented at theCollection today, and the
individuals who wrote the letter hope to put copies in every mailbox
and send it over all-campus e-mail. An excerpt from a draft copy
reads: "This close-mindedness and inability to accept others as
more than their ethnic/sexual background does not belong at a
school as sophisticated as this one where two-dimensionality does
not exist...this is not cool."

Nearby House Race Too Close to Call
This past Tuesday, United States Representative Jon Fox, a
Republican, narrowly defeated Democratic challenger Joseph
Hoeffel to keep his seat in the House. If Fox's victory stands up by
the same margin, ten votes out of over 240,000 ballots cast, the
election will be the third closest election in U.S. history.
The 13th Congressional District, located in Montgomery County
in northern Philadelphia, was Fox's to lose; his announced victory
is not completely a done deal. 11,000absentee ballots remain to be
counted, so an official tally is not expected until next week or even
later. Fox has declared a victory in a press release, although he has
not delivered an acceptance speech.
The race was not expected to be so close, as the area is highly
Republican and the incumbent Fox sunk $1.3 million into this
campaign, compared to only $750,000 by Hoeffel. Voters that were
moderate or progressive on social issues tended to lean towards

Hoeffel.

Public Safety Reports
On Tuesday, a student reported a broken front windshield on a
personal vehicle. The vehicle was parked in the C-lot offFieldhouse
Lane. In a separate incident on the same day, a student reported the
theft of a navy blue bookbag from Sharpies Dining Hall. The bag
was taken from the upstairs coat rack. The bag was later found near
Wharton, minus glasses and $lO.

GiridharSrinivasan '9B, aStudentCouncil member, feels that the important factor

Goundie believes "the people throwing
the party should pay for [drinks] themselves, the way grown-ups do when we
throw parties."
According to Executive Assistant to the
President and Associate Vice President
Maurice Eldridge '6l the student handbook when he was a student read that "The
possession and use ofliquor on the campus
is forbidden, as is drunken conduct."
Eldridge added of his own experience
with the campus drinking policy when he
was a student that, "Infractions ofthis and

Jill Ratzan
John Loser

A movement has recently begun at
Stanford University to reform the way
in which colleges and universities
report data to U.S. News & World
Report, and the way that this magazine handles and reports this data.
This movement, known as FUNC
(Forget U.S. News Coalition), is now
rapidly moving to numerous other
traditionally high-ranking colleges
and universities throughout the country.

According to FUNC leader and

founder Nick Thompson, a student at
Stanford, the purpose of the movement is "to get U.S. News to abandon

their overall formula for deciding
what makes 'the best university."'
FUNC members believe that higher
education "cannot and should not be
quantified;" thatparents and prospective students depend too much on
rankings; and that colleges and uni-

versities are constantly under "pressure to improve their rankings."
Rather than rank colleges based on
statistical formulas, FUNC members
believe that U.S. News should simply
publish the data that they receive
from schools in an alphabetic listing,
allowing students, parents, and others to see the raw data.
At Stanford, support is strong for
this movement. The student senate
recently passed a resolution denouncing these rankings and urging the
administration to stop sending U.S.
News the data they request. In response to the argument that Stanford
is only taking action because their
ranking has fallen, FUNC members
answer that "We would be doing this
if we were number one or if we were
number one hundred."
Three other schools, Rice University, the University of Michigan, and
Albion College, have passed similar
resolutions, and numerous other
schools will be voting this week.

According to the October 14 edition
of The Stanford Daily, student support has also been promised at
Harvard University, Yale University,
Princeton University, Antioch College, the University ofChicago, Tufts
University, University of California
at Santa Cruz, the University of Hawaii, and Washington University.
Although the Swarthmore administration has not yet officially discussed this issue, Dean of Admissions Robin Mamlet said, "I thinkthe
FUNC movement being led by some
Stanford students is raising some
important and valuable questions."
She added, "I think the kind of student Swarthmore attracts is not generally a person who will lean inappropriately on the word ofothers: our
students want to be sure this is the
right place for them, no matter what
we are ranked by U.S. News."
Al Bloom commented, "One particularly positive aspect of the U.S.
News & World Report rankings (in

addition to where they justifiably
position Swarthmore) is that they
place the nation's best small liberal
arts colleges alongside its best universities in equal visibility."
Student opinions toward the
rankings are mixed. While some students feel that ranking was influential in theirdecision to attendSwarthmore, others feel differently. John
Christodouleas '9B said thatthe decision to attend a particular school is "a
personal thing" and that is difficult to
quantify in numbers. Thalia Mills
'OO expressed a similar ambivalence
toward ranking, saying, "Where
Swarthmore ranks doesn't change the
amount of work we have to do."
Andrew Groat '97, in cooperation
with the Public Relations Office, is
currently working on a study to determine whatrole college rankings and
guide books played in student's decisions to attend Swarthmore. The results of the survey will be available
soon.

to an interracial community in Los
Baugh has an interesting history of Angeles, and picked up linguistic fa-

cility with a number of accents along
the way.
He demonstrated his prowess during the lecture, moving from a "stan-

dard, white, middle-class" accent to a
"black" accent to a "Chicano" accent. He also backed it up with experimental proofs; in an experiment
he ran, a majority of people believed
him to be of the ethnicity he imitated
when they heard his voice.
Baugh's recent goal has been to
develop a new way to convict people
of housing discrimination. Under the
old system, a biracial couple would
try to rent an apartment. The white
partner would negotiate the initial
phases of the agreement, and then the
black partner would attempt to finalize the deal. If thelandlordrefused to
sign the deal, that was taken as evidence of discrimination.
Baugh's new technique involved a
series of phone calls to a prospective
landlord. He would call someone who
had advertised an apartment to let,
first using his "white, middle class"
inflection, then using his "black" inflection, and finally his "Chicano"
inflection, giving three different numbers. He found that they often called
the "white" number back, while ignoring the "minority" numbers, which
he viewed as evidence of discrimination. He held out hope that the government might use this technique,

which is easier and cheaper to use.
After he described his research,
Baugh went on to try to tie it into
larger theories on accents. Baugh
talked a lot about the theories of
Marvin Gardner, which Baugh said
he had encountered only recently. In
particular, Baugh cited Marvin
Gardner's theory of linguistic intelligence. Gardner splits intelligence into
numerous disparate categories, of
which linguistic intelligence is but
one. However, Baugh noted thatwhat
Gardner considers "linguistic intelligence" includes many cultural-specific characteristics, such as literacy
and educated diction. Hence, Baugh
said, when people heard certain linguistic characteristics, they were
likely to think of the speaker as stupid.
Baugh's videos illustrated this
point. One video used a number of
film clips to illustrate that dumb yokels often spoke with non-standard
accents. Regional accents are used in
cinema to evoke evil or comic relief;
the good guys always speak standard
English. Baugh argued that this was
not a good thing: "just because someone has access to education doesn't
make them smarter than others."
From Swat to Stanford, from federal housing discrimination to the
O.J. trial, Baugh's lecture covered a
lot of ground.

TheBoard of Managers Task
Force on Land Utilization recently released a report on the
facilities and land the College
would need were it to expand
enrollment.
"It was concluded that an
expansion of two hundred students would require a variety

of additional facilities, all of
which could be contained
within the boundaries of
Chester Road and the Crum.
The Board was also concerned
with the adequacy of nearby
housing stock for faculty and
developing the means to systematically acquire additional
properties contiguous to campus as the opportunity arose,"
Assistant to the President
Maurice Eldridge said of the

study.
The study was not presented
to the College Planning Committee at its first meeting of the
year. Tara Zahra '9B, a student
member of the CPC, said, "I
haven't read anything like that
yet.. .1 am sure it will come up,
but as of yet I haven't heard
anything about it."
The College Planning Committee, however, has commissioned Vice President Paul
Aslanian and Treasurer Sue
Welsh to conduct a study on
thefinancial implications of expanding enrollment by two
hundred for a total enrollment
of approximately 1600 stu-

dents.
Eldridge dispelled any rumors that the studies are an
indication that the college
would expand enrollment in the
immediatefuture. He emphatically stated "that increasing or
decreasing the size of the College beyond or below the
Board-established-level is not
on the table."

{Continued from page 1}
Mary Anne Stewart, administrative assistant in the Economics Department, says she currently goes to
the annex room to eat her lunch, or
goes into the seminar room across the
hall and closes the door, and says "it
would be nice if we had our own little
room where we could have
lunch...but it's not that big a deal."
A woman who works with Environmental Services echoes this sentiment, and says "it would be nice" if
there was either a joint lounge or a
staff lounge, and says she now eats in
Tarble or off campus. "It's a little
weird" that the lounge is for faculty
only. She says she did not realize that
it was for faculty only, and has sat
there to drink coffee on her breaks in
the past. She noted that it was usually
empty, an observation confirmed by
many faculty.
However, Hollister said that if the
Kohlberg lounge became open to staff
it would become "overwhelmed by
staff just because of the sheer numbers of staff and the proximity of
space." Sighting the need for meaningful dialogue between faculty, he
said "my guess is...that they [staff]
would be inhibited in such discussions, and many of the faculty would
be too arrogant to involve themselves
in such discussions." He noted that
discussions would deteriorate to conversations about what's broken in
Kohlberg. "For some of the staff they
might [participate in the dialogue],
but for a lot of them they're really
here performing other functions
[rather] than involved in a discourse
about the substance of liberal arts
education," although he acknowledged that people have a problem
with the lounge because it is exclusionary.
Visiting Assistant Professor of
Sociology Lisa Hajjar, sees this as
faulty logic. "The faculty lounge is
an arbitrary distinction made because
people have different responsibilities...We're all adults and should be
able to relate in the same space." She

Faculty-only lounge perpetuates

stratification.

When the old Parrish Annex was torn down, the College's faculty/staff
lounge was pulled down with it. When Kohlberg was built, a lounge was built
to compensate for the loss. However, this lounge presents one major flaw
it is open only to faculty.
The stratification that already exists between the faculty and staff at
Swarthmore should come as a surprise to no one. While faculty and staff
members do have a chance to interact in Fall Fest, this is an infrequent event.
Throughout the rest of the year, faculty and staff meet separately for meetings,
work different hours, and most importantly, earn different salaries. The issue
is not a novelty to anyone at Swarthmore; questions in the past over how best
to provide day-care for faculty and staff have raised the same concerns
adequate care of the quality the College would like to provide for all its
employees would remove an extraordinarily large chunkfrom the budget. But
asking employees to pay a fee for child care would theoretically eliminate the
possibility of interaction between faculty and staff children. Perhaps it is
important to recognize that many of the members of the staff are earning no
more than what students earn at work-study jobs here on campus.
The Kohlberg lounge seems no more than a specific representation of this
inherent distinction between faculty and staff. Essie Mae's is one of the most
popular eating places on campus, for a variety of reasons. One of which is the
idea that on any given day, you can see Associate Dean Tedd Goundie,
Associate Dean Bob Gross, and a variety ofprofessors all sitting alongside of
students and staff employees. Even if direct conversation is not taking place
between the levels, the potential is there. And this potential is integral to
building a true community at the College. Putting the faculty behind closed
doors in a faculty-only lounge then dictates that the Cappuccino Bar in
Kohlberg is primarily student-only. While interaction will clearly still take
place in other ways and in other spaces, this kind of separation ofthe different
groups on campus only furthers their isolation.
One ofthe reasons given for making the Kohlberg lounge faculty only is the
omnipresent issue of space allocation. But faculty members insist the lounge
is rarely used. What, then, is the point of forbidding staff employees of the
College to eat their lunches there, orstop off between shifts to sit down for a
few minutes? Currently, split shifts require some Sharpies workers to remain
on campus between meal hours, but there is no lounge space on campus to
which they are welcome to go.
The first-year class is lauded as one of the most diverse classes ever, both
racially and socioeconomically. And in Swarthmore students, this is exactly
what the College is seeking. Why, then, is it perpetuating what seems to be no
more than class stratification among its employees?

Considering

the

College's policy on

alcohol

We all know that our alcohol policy is best described by "Don't ask, don't
tell." We' ve all seen the party permits thatrequire the signature of two twentyone year-olds if there will be alcohol at the function, the Party Associates first
hired last year, the signs saying "You must be 21 years old to drink in the state
ofPennsylvania," and the occasional check forSwat identification at the door
of Olde Club or Tarble, but none of these measures have particularly
noticeable effects. Basically, we know if we want alcohol, we can have it.
While the College is far from condoning alcohol consumption by minors,
the majority of us appreciate the typically unspoken assumption that
Swarthmore students are responsible adults and should be treated as such.
This means that underage students will drink, but the hope is that they will
drink safely. RAs receive training to recognize and care for students who
appear to be drinking too heavily, providing a safety net which can prevent
more serious incidents from occurring.
This policy also ensures that students who do drink excessively will be
treated by the appropriate means without repercussions; theirparents will not
be called and they will not be officially punished by the school. What this
means is thatminors who require medical attention do not need to fear calling
for help.
Yet the alcohol policy, however beneficial students may find it,is implicitly
violating state drinking-age laws. There have been incidents in which
Swarthmore Borough police have confronted drunk students wandering off
after parties. And we cannot really blame them for this, since Pennsylvania
state law specifies a drinking age which must be enforced.
Bryn Mawr and Haverford both have explicit rules about the consumption
of alcohol in public spaces. In order to serve alcohol at a party, students at
Bryn Mawr have to get permission from their dorm supervisors. Haverford
College has an honor code about the use and abuse of substances, which
students report to be much more "real" than Swarthmore or Bryn Mawr's.
However, students residing in Haverford College Apartments were recently
expelled and arrested on charges of drug use and possession.
The question really seems to be whether the College should be forced to
abide by the standards of the state. And in fact the College has maintained its
commitment to treating students as responsible adults despite the restrictive
provisions of the federal Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act passed in
1989. We are not suggesting that Swarthmore is somehow above the rest of
the state, but rather that perhaps that statewide guidelines are not necessarily
applicable to the College's intentions. After all, we partake in little else that
would typify us as normal citizens—few of us work, fewer of us drive cars,
virtually none of us walk our dogs on weekends or spend Friday nights at the
mall. Since even with our great powers of persuasion Swatties are unlikely to
change the parameters of state and federal alcohol policy anytime soon, it is
fortunate that we do not have to engage in such a crusade here on campus.

The last two elections were so
straightforward. In 1992, you knew
what to do. You went out and partied.
You laughed at your Republican
friends. You said things like "It's the
economy, stupid," and "New Democrat." You gave up your religion and
converted to Carvillism. Youhad high
hopes for what a single-party government could do for the liberal agenda.
In 1994, you also knew what to do.
You stared at the television. You let
your jaw touch the floor. You politely wondered what the hell eastern
Washington was thinking when they
ousted the Speaker ofthe House. You
mumbled incoherent sentences like
"But the race was so close" and "I
don't understand." You wondered
why anyone whose name mocked
small reptiles deserved anything out
of life. You told your Republican
friends to shut up before you permanently wiped the evil smirks off of
their evil, Republican faces. You
thanked God for filibusters, and
looked forward to the next election.
But in 1996, it was a little less
certain. It's hard, after all, to get too
excited about a presidential candidate who had as much of a chance of
losing as Bob Dole had of winning.
The election of a divided government, consisting of a Republican
Congress chosen by ambivalently
narrow margins, didn't seem terribly
surprising. In 1996, you might have
lookedaround you, maybe got worked

up about a local race back home, and
thought "Hmmmph."
Yes, 1992 sneaked up and tapped
you on the shoulder and swept you
offofyour feetbeforeyou even knew
anyone was standing behind you. And
1994 whopped you over the head
with a broom and dragged you across
the floor before you knew the floor
was there.
But 1996. Nineteen ninety-six, I'm
afraid, just sort of sat there with a
look on its face similar to that of a cat
who won't get off the furniture. It
knew it was better than you, whether
you were liberal, conservative, Democrat, or Republican.
But the message that voters sent to
Washington this time was no less
potent nor less worthy of discussion
for its lack of shock value. I contend
that the most interesting aspect of
this election is what voters were saying about the leadership they wanted
to see at the head of their nation.
In his acceptance speech, President Bill Clinton frequently mentioned the need for future bipartisan
cooperation. The voters, he said, were
sending a message with their closely
split Congressand their dividedticket.
They were sending the message of
compromise. "When we are divided,
we defeat ourselves, but when we
join our hands, America always
wins." The challenges facing our society today, he said, "are not Democratic or Republican challenges, they
are American challenges."
It is interesting, I think, to consider

Moral Fables for
the Reconstruction
By

Thomas R. Makin

Ah, so I have been requested to
write an opinion for the venerable
Phoenix and I have chosen to respond
with my personal conservative credo
of sorts. I sense a collective shudder
from the faithful readership as they
brace themselves for the coming
storm ofinvective from the reigning
editor of Common Sense. As selfappointed lightning rod for the general abuse of conservatives on campus, I guess I should expect to be
considered theCreator and Dispenser
ofDarkness. Well, I shall try my best
to disappoint.
I want to write about caring and
about making sure that one doesn't
screw over one's fellow man. What?
A conservative mentioning the word
caring in a sentence that doesn't start
and end with an ugly sneer? Where
did I get such a concept? I'll admit
it—l picked it up in church.
I've developed a belief that social
conservatism has nothing to do with
the condemnation of individuals or
with attacking those who are different. Rather, my particular viewsabout
social issues are all founded in my
belief that people should not hurt
other people. Sounds simple, doesn't
it? It is simple, it's just hard.
I am pro-life not because I think
that women who have abortions and
judges that sentence people to the
electric chair are evil and should catch
thefirst express trainto Hades. Rather,
I believe that a "Who is a Who, no
matter how small." Or no matter how
underdeveloped or how criminal or
how distasteful or how inconvenient.
I believe that the family is important and that two people should get
marriedfor love and to have a family;
they shouldn't have spent their entire
teenage years practicing "family planning" with several people withwhom
they wouldn'tin a million years ever
want to have a family.
I believe that taxes are the redistribution of wealth in disguise and we
should just admit it and do it right.
Why waste time, effort, and money
disguising our best attempt to take
money from those with extra and
give it to thosewho are unable to take
care of themselves? We get only 28
cents on the dollar to those for whom
the taxes are collected because we
have a huge wall of bureaucracy set

up to hide the fact that, yes, we really
do have a mixed economy. I am sick
ofliberals trying to spend the American people's money on special interests and on entitlements for those
who won't make even a half-decent
effort to make it in life. I am just as
disgusted with conservatives who
want lower taxes so that they can
have the extra cash to vacation in the
Caribbean and whose idea of volunteering is to give five bucks to the
Red Cross lady outside the grocery
store.

Every day, more and more issues
seem to me to be social issues. Abortion and welfare are obvious ones,
but every issue seems to have social
roots. If people weren't greedy, welfare would be less necessary. Ifpeople
valued their families and respected
their elders, we wouldn't need Social
Security as much as we do now. If
people weren't promiscuous or IV
drug users, theAIDS epidemic would
be gone in 15 years.
Do I really believe that suddenly
people are really going to care and
are really going to quit doing things
that hurt themselves and others? No,
not really. But somehow, the left has
claimed the high ground ofidealism.
Demanding that the government exact a particular amount of money
from the populace to fix the symptoms of social problems has somehow become synonymous with caring and understanding and having a
big heart. I disagree heartily. There is
nothing more idealistic than hoping
that people can just get along—that
people don't need to be selfish.
Think about it. What if we all chose
a particular well-intentioned thought
and everybody started practicing it
today? Perhaps if we all agreed not to
kill this year. And then next year, we
decided that no one would steal. And
then the year after that, perhaps we
could all quit sharing our most precious gifts of love and sex with the
amount of thought that we take to
order a shake at McDonald's. Then
we could stop lying and hating and
mocking others. If we could just start
with one well-intentioned thought.
Just think about it. Just think about
the fewer dead people and the fewer
poor people and the fewer broken
hearts and fewer damaged psyches
we would have if we all just truly
cared. Who'll go first?

SIGN UP IN CAREER PLANNING AND PLACEMENT

By

Andrew

Bryce

A few days ago, something absolutely
amazing happened. Our country raised its
voice in a shout of belief, and from that shout
new leaders arose. But there are people who,
I believe, overlook the glory of democracy.
Remember, we fought a war for it. Whether
you're a pacifist or a soldier, we fought wars
to help other countries protect their democracies. Why kill for it? Why die for it? Not to
end the world. And certainly not for people to
hate and distrust the government. There is
something inherently wonderful in a democracy, in the ability to BE HEARD; we would
not have fought for it otherwise.
What is this discontent and anger? Why
such hatred of the government? Yes, the
system is not perfect, but it is a system that
belongs to us and to America. It is a system in
which we have a voice. I voted last Tuesday,
the first time I ever did. It was only a piece of
paper, but on it was written my ideas and my
beliefs; it was my voice, and in whatever
small way, it was heard. The wonderful thing
is, not only can my voice be heard on a ballot,
but on the radio, or in the newspaper, or
wherever I want. That is part of our gift of
freedom: the right to speak.
It is on this right to speak that I base this
article. Suddenly, I see posters and signs all
over campus concerning about "hate speech."
This provokes mixed emotions: people have
a perfect right to speak, of course. People can
be right-to-life, or pro-choice, or liberal, or
conservative; whatever their choice, it is generally accepted by society. What about those
who hate? Do they have a right to speak?
Well, they are people, obviously, and, like
everybody else, do have a right to voice their
opinion. Their beliefs are theirbeliefs, I guess.
We really shouldn't judge them for that.
And yet...is it really "using your voice" to
throw flagrant insults and slurs at people? It
seems to me that it really stretches the limits
of the tolerance that our society can provide.
It is a vulgarity; almost a prostitution of our
liberty. Taking this wonderful system and
using it to berate and condemn members of
the human race is a slap in the face to those
who died to protect freedom.
However, a lot of people reach this point in

their reasoning and decide that the best answer is to completely silence this offensive
speech. I, myself, believe this to be a mere
"easy way out," and not the proper solution to
this problem. No matter what, I cannot condone a system or society that says to people,
"You can't say that." No matter what. No
matter how ugly I think hate speech is, I also
believe deeply that censorship in any form is
also a vulgar twist on liberty. Censorship
becomes the second wrong in the "two wrongs
don't make a right" formula. Whatever is
done, simply disallowing this hateful speech
is almost hateful in itself.
So, first observation: there is hate speech.
Second observation: this kind of speech is not
what is intended for freedom. Third observation: silencing speech is also not what is
intended for freedom. What happens now?
It's quite a dilemma. In an ideal situation,
society shouldbe able to grow past such petty
hatred. Of course, that's not a very realistic
hope. I am not part of a minority, so I cannot
answer this question as well as one might
like, but I will certainly try.
There are basically two forces at work
here: freedom of speech, and anger and dislike. Because there is hate speech, it is obvious that both forces are at work on one side of
this issue, the side of those who speak hatefully. Of the two forces, freedom of speech is
obviously the more beneficial to society. Let
the other side of this issue, those who are hurt
by hate speech, take up only this one force,
this virtue of freedom.
Granted, their angeris well understood, but
ifthey chose not to implement it, ifthey chose
to accept only the force of free speech, what
would happen? They would speak back, if
they wanted, and tolerate, ifthey could. They
would not silence. To me, that sounds like a
better solution; even though the problem is
based on hate, I don't think the solution need
be. Why fight fire with fire? Why not fight it
with water?
To conclude, I can only say that I hope,
however illogically, that we are the last generation to have to answer this issue. It is a
hateful and ugly thing to have to talk about. I
often ask myself if the world will ever love
instead of hate. As long as this issue exists,
I'm not sure if it will. But I hope.

Proposes

Several
Ways to
Protect Her
Sharpies Salad

I

want to pose to you a question publicly
that you have probably asked silently
many times: just how effective is the
sneeze guard over the salad bar in Sharpies?
Now this is a question that is near and dear
to me because there is nothing more important in my life than fresh, crisp salad.
I have done extensive testing on a life size,
mock-up salad bar that I have created out of
cellophane and aspirin in my room. I then fed
my data into the formula (s.a.)(2rc)/
52=(e.s.g.)(v)(c) where s.a. is the altitude of
the sneeze, e.s.g. is the sneeze guard's effectiveness, v is the velocity ofthe sneeze and c
is a constant that I made up.
While solving for e.s.g. and taking into
account atmospheric pressure and the wind
chill for the greater Philadelphia area, I can
definitively say that the sneeze guard is only
14 percent effective against a full frontal
sneeze coming from 4' 10" above floorlevel.
Do you know what that means? Do you
realize the implications? 86 percent of your
snot is being deposited on my lettuce (100%14%=86%)! The feta cheese is festering with
your phlegm! Gross!
So I, with the help of my conscientious
friends Dan and Becky, have come up with a
couple of solutions.
First, we must set up the salad bar in a giant
glove box. For those of you who do not deal
with hazardous, irradiated substances on a
regular basis, a glove box is "a sealed protectively lined compartment having holes to
which are attached gloves for use in handling
dangerous materialsinsidethe compartment"
(thank you, Webster's Ninth New Collegiate
Dictionary). Of course, there will be air locks
on either side of the salad bar through which
you can insert and remove your plate without
contaminating the inside environment of the

salad bar.
The glove box idea will also solve the
annoying traffic backup that often occurs at
the salad bar. A conveyer belt will be placed
inside the box which will steadily move your
plate along the line, thus thwarting those
people who like to arrange individual
garbonzo beans decoratively on their plates
for extensive periods of time.
An alternative to the glove box that continues the tradition of our existing, ineffective
sneeze guard is the individual sneeze guard.
You know those big, white plastic cones that
dogs wear around their necks that prevent
them from scratching their heads? They look
like inverted Elizabethan collars.
Well, I suggest that each person, before
approaching the salad bar, must put one of
these on to prevent any accidental snot transmission onto the otherwise unprotected salad
bar. Our collar, of course, will be made of
clear plastic so as not to restrict vision. I
haven't yet decided, though, how the distribution of these individual sneeze guards
should be implemented. Should the collar be
placed at the ends of the salad bar for you to
put on when you get your dishware and then
replaced when you're finished?
The problem with this plan is that some
poor Sharpies employee must be given the
additional responsibility of maintaining and
cleaning the soiled sneeze guards.
Perhaps, instead, each Swarthmore student should be given, along with our e-mail
accounts and mail boxes, an individual sneeze
guard upon entering the Swarthmore community. It would, then, be the responsibility
of each student to clean and maintain his or
her own sneeze guard. The problem withthis
is that you have to remember to bring it to
Sharpies each time you wanted salad.
Maybe it would be better if we just wore
the collars all the time. They're clear, remember, so the fashion savvy among us
wouldn't have to worry about the sneeze
guards clashing with their clothes.
On second thought, maybe wearing them
all the timeisn't a good idea. With the amount
of rain we get around here and the guard's
ability 1 to collect precipitation, some overly
tired and oblivious Swattie might forget to
remove the collar in the rain and drown on
Parrish Beach.
That would be bad and you would probably blame Becky and me for it, right? Well,
all the great revolutionary figures in history
were scorned by their contemporaries anyway. Why should we be any different?

How to Get a Swarthmore
Building Named After You
By

Dave Mimno

It

is often said that Swarthmore follows a
strong tradition of moral responsibility,
political activism, and social awareness.
Evidence for this claim abounds. The College
has large numbers of extracurricular groups
dedicated to social and political issues.
One particularly interesting example is the
controversy that arose last year among students surrounding Jerome Kohlberg's donation of several million dollars towards the
building of Kohlberg Hall. As many of you
are ho doubt aware, Kohlberg was a founding
member of KKR, which took over and consolidated smaller companies (mostly after
Kohlberg himself had retired). Should we
have taken the money? I myself am rather
partial to a nice cup of espresso and a fresh
croissant, but such a refusal would not have
been completely without precedent. In the
19205, the College was offered a massive
endowment on the condition that it cease
participation in all intercollegiate sports. Apparently, the donor thought that football was
overemphasized at the College.
One of the first major benefactors of the
college was Joseph Wharton. Wharton began
his career by opening the first successful zinc
works in the country. He later went on to
control for several years one-sixth of the
world's nickel production. He invested his
money in the Bethlehem Iron Works and
gained a controlling interest in it. The company later became Bethlehem Steel Co. Besides endowing the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business,
Joseph Wharton gave us the Wharton dormitory, the Friends Meeting house, and (together with Samuel Willets) Trotter hall.
Mertz dormitory was donated by Harold
Mertz '26 and his wife, Esther. Mertz began
selling magazine subscriptions to work his
way through college. He later began direct
mail advertising campaigns and went on to

found Publishers' Clearing House.
McCabe Library was given by Thomas
McCabe '3B, who was then president of the
Scott Paper Co. Friends Library was made
possible by a gift from Julian Cornell '3Oand
Virginia Stratton Cornell '3O, who also, not
surprisingly, gave the money for Cornell Science Library. Julian Cornell was a successful
lawyer who represented conscientious objectors on a pro bono basis.
DuPont was named after Pierre S. DuPont,
and was donated by the DuPont foundation. It
was built long before John DuPont went
crazy and shot that Olympic wrestler.
Eugene M. Lang '3B, a noted philanthropist and really nice guy, donated both the
Lang music building and Lang Performing
Arts Center (in addition to the Lang fragrance
garden). Lang, who is chairman emeritus of
the Board of Managers, founded Refac Technology Development Corporation, a large
international technology transfer firm.
Papazian Hall was originally the Bartol
Research Foundation of the Franklin Institute. The building only became Papazian in
1979 when Paul Restall '43 and Mary Ann
Boyer Restall '5O donated a large sum of
money to renovate it after it was purchased by
the college. It was named in honorofRestall' s
father, Hapet Papazian, a former Vice President for international affairs of the General
Electric Corporation.
The money to build Sharpies Dining Hall,
was donated by Philip T. Sharpies 'lO in
1964. Sharpies was a Philadelphia industrialist who founded Sharpies Corporation,
Sharpies Chemicals Inc. and Sharpies Oil
Inc., for which he was both president and
chairman of the board.
The College would not be the same today if
it were not for large private donations. If it
does decide to expand, we will be needing
quite a few more rich men and women who
founded successful and prosperous companies.

My Day of Glory at the New York City Marathon
By

Courage!

David

King

Perseverance! Personal triumph! These words could be used to
describe the runners in the New York
City Marathon, but I prefer to use them in
talking about my own experience with the
race— one of exhilaration, perspiration, and
most importantly, cold limbs.
November 3 marked the 27th anniversary
of the marathon, an annual event that has
grown into the largest and most well-known
race in the world, with 29,000runners, 13,000
volunteers, and a seemingly infinite number
of spectators. This year, again, the race caught
the eyes and ears of the world (well, / think,
anyway...) and brought out the enthusiasm
and spirit that New York City is famous for.
While a select group of "elite" runners
battled for the first-place trophy, and others
strove to merely complete the course, I chose
a different way of getting involved with the
spectacular event... one that didn't require me
to run 26.2 miles (walking fromParrish to the
mall is daunting enough as it is).
For the fifth year in a row, I worked as a
volunteer, helping to provide communications during the race. Of all the volunteer
jobs—including handing out water, encouraging ted runners, and helping at the finish
line mine was, without a doubt, the most
—

exciting and rewarding (read: power trip]
Stationed at mile 25 in Central Park, I spent the day,
along with nine other

and down the length
of the mile, looking for runners

,rom telling me
(o get out of the
street, which they often did, despite the credentials I wore around my

neck). Then, I proceeded to
stand. And wait. For a long time.
An hourhad gone by, as had several
thousand runners, when my mile captain called me on the radio to ask ifI wanted

to walk to the other end of the mile. I ripped

the speaker-microphone from my lapel,
blurted out an enthusiastic Yes!" and headed
down the road—on the street-side of the
barrier, mind you.
I reached the entrance to the park, across
from the Plaza Hotel, and waited some more.
Nothing...not one crisis. For several more
hours, I tried to entice the runners—just one,
at least to drop out or ask for an ambulance.
But, stare at my bright orange hat as they
would, no one did it.
As the runners started to thin out, I headed
back to the mile point, physically exhausted
and morally dejected. I planned to vie for
some comfort and solace from the other volunteers, but all they could talk about was how
many people approached them wanting to
drop out. So there I stood, like a chameleongreen with envy, and red, due to the cold.
One hot dog and several gulps of water
later, I said good-bye to everyone, flung my
backpack over my shoulder and headed out of
the park, being sure of three things: that I had
a great time, as always; that I had found an
excuse to go home for the weekend; and that
I would definitely be back next year.
(There are many ways to participate in the
Marathon. For information on how to get
involved next year, contact the New York
Road Runners Club at (212) 423-2201.)

A Stylistic, Unconventional Bright Room Art Appreciation at the

The

Devil makes a personal appearance midway
through Tony Kushner's A
Bright Room Called Day, saying, "I
sense great possibilities in the modern world." The times are 1932,1987,
and 1996; the places, Germany and
the United States. One character announces: "I read the histories of Germany. I read the Book of Revelations. I read the Times. I sense parallels."
Kushner's 1987 play, the predecessor to his Tony and Pulitzer prizewinning epic, Angels in America, is
being presented this weekend, a
Drama Board production directed by
Jennifer Shook '97. It's an elliptical,
devastating, exasperating, confrontational and wholly original work,
unapologetically political. The body
of the play unfolds in Germany between the years 1932-1933, tracing
the rise of the Nazi party and its
effects upon a small group of mostly
middle-classCommunist and pseudoCommunist artists, actors, and filmmakers. Agnes Eggling (Tobie Barton
'99) is the play's center, a center
which collapses in on itself. A halfheartedradical and actress ofmodest
success, Agnes is paralyzed before
ascendant fascism. Her friends—
Vealtninc Husz (Kevin Kish '9B),
lover, cinematographer, and sometime revolutionary; Annabella
Gotchling (Rachel Goldstein '97),
painter and Communist firebrand;
PaulinkaErdnuss (Anna Fricke '9B),
diva and compromised movie star;
and the inimitable Baz (Chy Spain

'00), theorist and aficionado of sexface the failure of the left, the snuff
ing out of Annabella's "luminouj
anger," in divergent ways: collabora
tion, flight, attempted suicide. At th(
heartofKushner's play is the struggle
between ideological fervor and human weakness.
The German narrative is
fragmented, presented in
short, elliptical scenes in/

and one from 1996(AnI

\
the 1987 Zillah who sees
those parallels, and makes
the connections between German fascism and American
conservatism.
According to Shook, Kushner
speaks through the Zillahs in a way
that is "directly and didactically political, in a way that playwrights are
not supposed to be." Two apocalyptic visions come crashing into each
other at the play's end: Agnes' evertightening spiral of terminal isolation
and an image of sleeping America, a
nation bound for new nightmares.
Like Angels in America, A Bright

stylistic options. Straight drama collides with political agitprop, images

All of the songs on the album are
written by Michelle Shocked, and
they reveal her dedication to her own
heritage; a heritage as dynamic as the
sounds she uses to express it. The
overall tone of the album is unmistakably morose. Many of the songs
were written after the death of
Shocked's grandmother, and they
revolve around themes of death and
the disintegration of family. The individual songs all collaborate to create a story of loss and anguish. Yet,
this story does have a satisfying conclusion: it moves from despair to
revelation and captures that strange
exhilaration fostered by listening to
great depressing songs.
It is clear that Michelle Shocked
has invested much ofherselfinto this
album. Its personality, diverse musical styles, and captivating narrative
combine toredefine the usual boundaries of an album. Each song is won-

Michelle

Shocked's newest
album, Kind Hearted
Woman, was nearly prevented from release because her recording company claimed that it violated her contractual agreement to
maintain "stylistic consistency" in
her music. Ironically, the songs that
comprise Kind Hearted Woman are
particularly wonderful because they
mesh so many different musical traditions. Sounds reminiscent of bluegrass, folk, rock, contemporary funk,
and countrified blues intertwine exquisitely to create an album that celebrates such stylistic discrepancies.
Some element of the album will appeal to nearly every musical taste.
Kind Hearted Woman presents a
history of the songwriter's life set
against antral background of passion
for the land and devotion to family.

derful on its own and as a contribution to the whole. Thisalbum is purely
about music, and how songs contribute to catharsis and the sharing of
life-stories. It is not about restraint,
whether emotional or stylistic. Commenting on her album, Shocked said,
"I swear to God I didn't want to make
this album. What I wanted to do was
make an album that grew out of how
strong and confident I've become as
a groovy rhythm guitar player and
sassy soul singer. While poised and
waiting to exhale, Kind Hearted
Woman came forth."
It is nice to be assured that some
people still make albums out of the
music that justhappens in reaction to
life rather than in reaction to whatthe
public want. It is also wonderful that
this musical happening reflects
Michelle Shocked's talent as an incredible guitar player and a singer
with much sass and soul.

Reagan, quoted in the
program, puts it: "You'd
be surprised how much being a good actor pays off."
What's missing in this descriptionof A Bright Room Called Day is
an acknowledgment of the
production's humor. Bleak, cleareyed, and scathing humor, to be sure,
but uproarious nonetheless. In the
paranoidcomplexitiesoftheZillahs'
ravings and the desperate witticisms
ofBaz and Paulinka, Kushner wields
laughter as a weapon. It's not a comfortable, effect, but then this is not a
comfortable play. Ideological as hell,

Barnes Foundation
By

Alla Brukman

Do

you ever feel like getting
away from Swarthmore?
Have you looked at every
single painting in the Philadelphia
Museum of Art? Then you might
want to visit the Barnes Foundation
Gallery in Merion. Established in
1922 by Dr. Albert C. Barnes, the
Foundation hopes to "promote the
advancement of education and the
appreciation of the fine arts."
The Gallery houses an astounding
collection of Impressionistpaintings,
including masterpieces by Renoir,

Cezanne, and Matisse. Greek, African, and Egyptian sculptures are interspersed among the paintings in
every room. Native American artifacts and antique furniture also form
part of the collection.
Dr. Barnes had no qualms about
mixing media and intermingling traditions, East and West, experimental
and traditional. The dynamic groupings of new and old masters form
juxtapositions that challenge visitors
to see connections and draw parallels
between works that are literally
worlds apart. These groupings have
been preserved during renovations to
the Gallery.
The Foundation was only recently
opened to the public because Dr.
Barnes envisioned the collection as
one that only served limited educational goals. Hisrestrictive will origi-

nally banned the touring of the museum by the public, as well as the
loan of its paintings to other museums. The Art Education Program
continues to bring in area students
today, butfinancialconstraints forced
theFoundation to reevaluate the terms
of the will. The recent renovation of
the Gallery was financed by the proceeds from thecollection's world tour,
which included the loan of their
Cezanne works to the Philadelphia
Museum of Art for this summer's
exhibit.
As Dr. Barnes envisioned his collection as an educational tool, an audio tour is available for visitors to
carry through the museum. The recordings contain information about
the paintings and the artists and
Barnes' theories of art appreciation.
The Gallery is located on the
grounds of an arboretum. Although it
can't compare to Swarthmore's plant
life, it contains a woodland, a formal
garden, and more than 250 varieties
oflilacs. Flower gardens, including a
rose garden designed by Dr. Barnes
and an annual garden, have recently
been restored to their original plans.
As an added bonus, visitorsmay gawk
at the huge MainLine mansions surrounding the Gallery.
TheFoundation is located offRoute
1 in Merion, PA and can be reached
taking the R5 train to Merion Station
or the 44 SEPTA bus from Philadelphia.

ergy out of little children, affording
him with life essence he cannot otherwise receive.
Fortunately forDenree, his adopted
brother, a circus strongman named
Oner goes to save him from the
clutches ofKrank. Adroitly portrayed
by Beauty and the Beast's R«":
Perlman, One encounters ail sorts of
weird beasts and people in his journey to save his brother from having
his dreams sucked out of him.
Said Jeunet in an interview, "For
us, someone who is deprived of
dreams is condemned to die. That's
part of what we wanted to say ...If one
cannot dream and imagine things,
and if one is sentenced to the everyday, to reality, it's awful." That is,
perhaps, the best way to describe the
film: a dream, a fantasy, a fairy tale
for grown-ups. With great special
effects. Andit's French, so it's therefore unutterably cool.
In this film, however, the plot is
secondary to the visuals. This is the
most expensive French film ever
made, and the costumes, the set design, and the makeup are all fantastic,
in both senses of the word. Twentytwo minutes of digital effects, including state-of-the-art CGI, make
the film a visual treat. It transports
you to another realm of wacky style
and machinery, a cross between Dr.
Seuss and Blade Runner.
The movie also has some of the
most off-the-wall comedy scenes ever
filmed, including one involving six
clones of the same man and another
involving Siamese twins in a kitchen.
The best way to get a feel for this
film is to check out the Web page, at
http://www.spe.sony.com/Pictures/
SonyClassics/city/. It has screen shots
and MPEGs that give some idea of
the fabulous visual effects.
City ofLost Children will be showing in Kirby Lecture Hall (Martin
Biological Laboratory) at 10 p.m. on
Monday, November 11. All are welcome, and admission is free.

Asian Festival a Culinary Delight
By

In

Aarti Iyer

light of Sharpies' brunch, a
large number of lucky students,
faculty, and administrators found
an alternative dining experience last
Saturday—the Asian Food Festival
that afternoon in Tarble.
The Pacific Rim Organization
(PRO) sponsored the event, which
was held to involve the College community in the celebration of Asian
food and culture.
PRO had cordially invited the
campus to partake in an Asian feast
cooked by various members of the
College community. Hey, who am I
to refuse such an invite? Others
clearly felt the same way: about 270
people placed advance reservations
for the occasion, and 200 students
and faculty members showed up, including Associate Dean Bob Gross,
Registrar Martin Warner, Lillian Li,
professor of history and Steve Piker,
professor of anthropology.
It wasn't meant to be such a huge
event, according to Amity Cox '99
and Stephanie Wang '99, who are
active members of PRO. "We were
trying to come up with a social event,

and it was originally going to be a
potluck lunch for those in the group,
and a few others," said Cox.
So many people responded, however, that it became a huge operation
on Friday night and Saturday morning. Students and members of the
faculty (including Steve Piker among
others) took over various dormkitchens, the IC kitchen, and even kitchens
in people's off-campus residences.
I got there about ten minutes after
the doors opened and there was already a line for the food. At the head
of the line my wait was rewarded:
delicious-looking dishes representing the cuisine of China, Vietnam,
Malaysia, Korea, Japan, the Philippines, and India, were spread out on
big tables.
And they tasted good, too. Being a
vegetarian, I didn't try the meat
dishes, but the "Make Sushi" was
delicious, as were the vegetarian
spring rolls, the Korean Kimchi fried
rice, the fried tofu, the eggplant, and
the Indian dessert.
Despite the small plates, I managed to pile up a lot of food, as did
most people. I didn't feel confident
enough to attempt to use the chop-

sticks, though some I observed had a
rather amusing time with them.
The atmosphere was pleasant and
comfortable. There were large, round
tables spread out across the room,
and people were very social. Martin
Warner's little son Teddy ran around
the room, pretending to know everyone and proceeded to place flowers
on a lot of the tables. There was
"ethnic" background music playing,
including some contemporary Chinese pop. "It was very keen," commented John Rieffel '99.
There were people of various ages
and cultural backgrounds present,
which made for a "positive, community-building experience," according
to Rich Vezina '99. Especially in
light of the recent hate speech incidences, it was good to see an event
that supported diversity in the College community.
"It was great to get so many people
to cookand to get the event together,"
said Yuhki Tajima '99, who prepared
a Japanese beef curry dish for the
occasion. "I talked to a lot of people
who felt that it was well-organized,
and who had a good time. People
want to keep doing this every year."

A Look

Behind Sports Medicine at Swarthmore...

Sarah McClure

When Doug Weiss, director of
Sports Medicine, took a job as assistant trainer at the College, he only
planned on staying here for three

years.

Weiss was trained as a medical and
physical therapist in the Navy. With
this background, he became head
trainer at the Marine Corps Schools
at Quantico, VA.
He loved the job so much that he

chose to pursue a career in sports
medicine. While attending the University of Pennsylvania part-time to
obtain a public physical therapy license, Weiss worked as an assistant
trainer at UPenn for four years. He
then served as an assistant trainer for
the Philadelphia Eagles for another
four years.
Weiss' originally came to Swarthmore to experience Division 111 ath-

letics. "I thought working at Swarthmore would be a springboard to
achieve whatI thought was my niche,
to be a head trainer at a Top Ten
school," he explained.

I've ever known," Weiss continued.
"I think I've learned more from the
students than I've been able to share
with them."

For the first and only time in Swarthmore College history, coach Sue
Davis was wrong. Mistaking the dates
for the first annual Centennial Conference Relay Meet, the team was
forced to the water a week earlier
than expected and after only two
weeks of practice.
Although they expected the meet
to be a week later, the team gathered
strength and spirit and performed well
despite the short notice.
Experienced fighters and new re-

cruits have joined skills in anticipation of another powerful season. Returning talents include captains Jaime
Raich '97, JulienLartigue '97, Kristen
Robertson '9B, and Alice Unger '9B.
The team is stacked with returning
NCAA National qualifiers Robertson,
Jill Belding '99, Janine Gent '99,
Jenny Harvey '99, Cathy Polinsky
'99, Alanna Roazzi '99, and Andy
Robbins '9B.
New members of the program include assistant coach Tammy John
(an alumna from rival Gettysburg),
several extraordinary first-years, and
even one sophomore.
Practices have been challenging,
but the team has been "swimming
tough" and the hard work is paying
off. The first-years have done an impressive job tackling new techniques
and adjusting to a hectic schedule.
Practices have been enhanced this
season by the addition of the

did not compete in sports in college,
training is his way of staying involved in sports.

It was a bit frosty for the "fairweathered"Swattie this past Sunday,
but a few brave soccer souls ventured
out for Intramural soccer. In the early
matches, the Lambnuts and the Burlap Barbarians were awarded forfeit
wins, since they were the only groups
to show up. In the spirit of Intramural
play, these groups banned together to
play a pick-up match to keep warm.
In the second set of games the
Psycho Squirrels were awarded a forfeit win and played a short-sided
match to prepare for the start ofplayoffs. The only match that went on as
planned was the FabFaculty/Stupendous Staff against the 1-20's. This

The basic structure is simple

of the Championship Final. With
fewer than two minutes to go in regulation, the FF/SS tied the game at 22. In the overtime periods the 1-20

our winter seasons, there are still
openings for more floor hockey and

On Monday afternoon, Swarthmore
was notified that they had received a
bid in the prestigious NCAA Division 111 field hockey tournament.
Having gone undefeated in the Centennial Conference and compiled an
overall record of 15-4, the Garnet
stand in good shape in the midst of an
equally impressive pool of competitors. To say the team was ecstatic
when they received the good news is
an understatement. Coach Karen
Borbee was excited as well.
"I think it's great," she said. "I am
so proud of this team. They set their
goal to make the playoffs, and they
did it. I especially want to credit the
senior class who demonstrated out-

standing leadership throughout the
season. The captains— Lia Ernst '97,
Erin Flather '97, and Kelly Wilcox
'97 —also did an outstanding job of
guiding this team through a rough
beginning and an incredible finish to
the regular season."

In the first round of regionals, the
Garnet face Messiah, whose record is
identical to Swarthmore's. For religious reasons (Messiah can not play
on Sundays), the contest will be held
Friday at 10 a.m. Coach Borbee intended to learn more about their firstround opponent, but all she could
report as of Wednesday was that
"Messiah lost to Ithaca, and we beat
them. They also beat Gettysburg and
Dickinson, but so did we."
Messiah plays on turf, so the Garnet have been practicing for the nationalcompetition at St. Joseph's University. When asked how she would
prepare the team, CoachBorbee said,
"We have two games (on turf) under
our belts this season, but we need
more time on the turf to get our timing down. Other than that, we are
ready to play!"
The winner of the SwarthmoreMessiah match will face the winner
of Cortland State (NY) vs. Wooster
(Ohio). Coach Borbee believes that
Messiah and Cortland are the teams

with the best reputations and is happy
with the match-ups.
More good news for the team arrived when the results of the conference post-season coaches' poll were
announced.
Danielle Duffy '9B was a repeat
first-team All-Conference choice and
was also named the Conference's
Player of the Year for the second
consecutive year.
Duffy was fourth in conference
scoring this year with eight goals and
three assists to total 19 points. She
holds conference records for assists
in a season (17), assists in a career
(30), and career points (64).
Flather and Wilcox joined Duffy
on the first-team. Wilcox led the conference with a .925 save percentage
and a 0.49 goals against average in
league play.
Midfielders Ernst and Donna Griffin '99 were named to the secondteam. Ernst was a first-team selection
in 1995, and Griffin is a repeat second-team choice.

Forum on Multiculturalism in the Curriculum
In the interest of stimulating further thought and discussion about multiculturalism in the curriculum, we invited students,
faculty members, and administrators to share their views. Contributors were not aware of the content of other submissions;
we encouraged offers to define the paramaters of their discussion. The people we selected are not necessarily speaking in their
official capacities, regardless ofany affiliations listed.
Amy Albert, Erin Ruble
& Maurisa Thompson
The academy. Colleges and universities have occupied two contradictory roles virtually since their
existence: they both support "the
dominant paradigm" and are a locus
for subversive activism. Institutions
like Swarthmore have come under
serious attack in the last thirty years
as the enfranchisement of people of
color and women has led to an increasingly diverse enrollment and
to challenges to an "old-boy" network, in which colleges often served
to promote classed, raced and
gendered divisions among the
American populace.
One ofthe several areas challenged
is
the way the academy
contextualizes, presents, and prioritizes curricula in the attempt to map
the way to a broader and thus more
enlightening, provocative, and rewarding educational environment.
Swarthmore and other colleges
and universities across the nation
will have to change by
reprioritizating the contents of the
literary and theoretical canon and
the focus of our curricula in relation
to that canon. Texts by writers of
color, womenand queerpeople cannot simply be seen as additions to
the curriculum.
Each class that presents a European and Euroamerican canon
should do so self-consciously, meaning that they should examine the
role that empire, racism, classism,

and sexism have played (frequently
silently) in constructing those discourses. Furthermore, we must begin to evaluate what ismissing from
our course offerings—such omissions are intellectually damaging not
only to the groups that have traditionally clamored for change, but to
the "neutral" and "resistant" parties
as well.
As James Baldwin observes, in
the case of African-American presence in the curriculum, "1f...0ne
managed to change the curriculum
in all the schools so that [AfroAmericans] learned more about
themselves and their real contributions to this culture, you would be
liberating not only [Afro-Americans], you'd be liberating white
people who know nothing about their
own history. And the reason isthat if
you are compelled to lie about one
aspect of anybody's history, you
must lie about itall. If you have to lie
about my real role here, if you have
to pretend that I hoed all that cotton
just because I loved you, then you
have done something to yourself.
You are mad."
The idea that there is and has always been a plural vision of Western, particularly American, culture
and history, and that this vision has
for too long been written out of the
dominant discourse, should be only
one of the bases for expanding our
breadth ofstudy at S warthmore even
further. Why are there no Latino or
Asian-American Studies concentrations? Why are there so few courses
on Africa? On NativeAmerican cultures?
While not all of these courses can
be offered due to the College's small
size, we must ask ourselves, what
are we choosing to focus on now?
How could we modify—nay, revolutionize—our prioritizations to reflect our own growing diversity and
a more advanced understanding of
the workings of the modern world?
Our responsibility as a college
community extends further into the
curriculum than simply ensuring that

diverse subject matter is being
taught. We must also pay close attention both to how issues of diversity are presented withinSwat classes
and to the value the academy assigns
to courses within our offerings. It is
important that representations of a
diverse society are incorporated
throughout the curriculum and that
new course matter is not put on a

second tier ofacademic importance.
On a class-by-class basis, this means
ensuring that students are presented
with material about people of color,
women and queer people integrated
into the syllabus and to discussion
topics, not as an irregular, offhand
pitch for multi-culturalism. On an
institutional level, offering PDCs in
Latino and Black Studies (to name
two) would prove institutional support for curricular diversity.
True multiculturalism goes beyond a superficial sprinkling of a
few famous authors, or a few classes
offered sporadically; it must be rigorous treatment of entire fields, and
of the theory and the social contexts
which created them, along with the
idea that neglect of such subjects is
simply an incomplete education.
Finally, we need to examine the
methodology that we use in talking

about difference and diversity within
the classroom to insure that our inclusiveness produces greater consciousness in as many Swat students
as possible. One methodology to
question is the use of the "other" in
Swarthmorian discourse. Professors
use the concept of the "other" in
order to bring "new" voices into the
curriculum and examine the treatment of difference in our society.
However, studying the "other" re-

sults in five main problems. First,
defining one experience as that of
the other implies a "we," reifying
the notion that white men aged 35-

all positioned by race, gender, class,
and age, and thus are implicated in
what they study in different, but
complete, ways. In the classroom,
this means addressing issues of diversity as a bridge between the personal and the academic.

When I came to Swarthmore as a
1957, "multiin
culturalism" was not in our vocabulary, not in the curriculum and not
on anyone's agenda. I came in a
more innocent time in the U.S., believing I was in the forefront of an

freshman

integrationist movement which
would change America for the better. I believed that small academic
communities like this one (and the
high school I had attended) could
lead the way. While not a pioneer, I
was one of the early "settlers" and I
found life much harder than I had

anticipated.
Not only was there a vast void in
the English curriculum (my intended
and eventual major) but also a void
in the population of students and
faculty. There were few women and
no people of color on the faculty.
There were one or two African
American students at a time and a
few African students.

Second, it collapses apolitical coalition category composed of a huge
number ofnon-cohesive groups into

Thirdly, studying the "other" also

to talk about race in any contemporary context. Mozart did not share a

sends the message that Others aren't
intellectuals, but are the subject of
intellectualism. To study the "other"
one must speak as a white man or
one lacks objectivity.
Fourth, it makes expert testifiers
out ofthose studied as the "other" by
exoticizing the experience of people
of color, queer people and women

and labeling discrimination and
alienation as something that happens to the Other. People of color
are often asked to speak about being
the "other," as it is assumed that
only people of color are capable of
understanding, and having emotions
about, issues of race.
Finally, the use of the "other" in
the curriculum allows those outside
of the otherized group to think of
themselves as neutral observers of
identity politics. Terms such as "racism" versus "white supremacy" shift
the focus from white privilege and
active and often unconscious discrimination to a sourceless cross
people of color must bear.
Studying the "other" instead of
the system of oppression allows
white people at Swat to deny their
privilege and consequent implication in this system and reason that
since they are not the racists that
make the "others" feel badly nor are
they the "other" who feels the effect
of discrimination, they must be neutral, blameless. Further, it allows
white students to study the "other"
without fighting racism because they
see it as a theoretical problem.
In creating an inclusive curriculum, Swarthmore must find new
methodologies which connect the
experiences of oppression we read
and study about with our own lives
as students and faculty members,
and that to do any less would be the
mis-education of a college community.
We must struggle to include a
broader array of courses which do
not focus on racial dynamics as simply black and white, but rather on
the complex interplay ofracial identifications and how they contribute
to a system of oppression.
Furthermore, we must ask students to acknowledge that they are

beat with Monk.
On the other hand, the strings of
my being were plucked by so many
people trying to find a music in me
that could be the black experience
for them. Trying to be the instrument of education for so many was
too draining.
With the perspective gained over
the nearly 40 years which have
passed since then, I believe that the
much greater diversity we have
achieved here in the curriculum and
the community has renewed the op-

portunity for Swarthmore and other
places like it to modelthe conditions
required for shaping a better world.
Such shaping is no easier than it
was forty years ago, but we do have
more instruments on which to play
much more richly diverse music.

The meaning of multiculturalism
has been greatly misunderstood by
many members of the general community, but in particular, those who
oppose it as another misdirected ef-

fort by far-left liberals.
Even on this campus, a lot more
needs to be accomplished in order
for Swarthmore to accurately reflect
much of the existing rhetoric.
Multiculturalism means more than
exposing underrepresented areas in
the curriculum, an important element is illuminating the nexuses of
cultures, the not so clear points where
cultures coincide. These are the areas in which true learning takes place.
These are the points that will become ineluctably essential to performing in and understanding the
globalization of the world.
Embracing new approaches and
new subjects to education is only
worthwhile if deliberate attention is
placed upon understanding how
these new initiatives intersect. The
college can offer an increasingly
diverse curriculum, but it will only
be a fruitful experiment if these new
experiences are clearly linked in
some deliberate manner.
The goal of multicultural education should be twofold: one side
emphasizes the varying complexities of the world, acknowledges those
complexities, and then embraces

them in the exi sting curricularframe
work and the other side emphasizes
the learning that comes from understanding how these new areas and
perspectives fit into the understandings that we previously possessed.
Thisapproache acknowledges an important role for both the old and the
new. The old exist to not only be
augmented by the new, but the old
also works to shape a foundation by
which the new can be understood
and applied.
However, in considering the role
of multiculturalism in curricular
planning, we must be aware of the
limits imposed on us by the nature of
a small liberal arts college. Swarthmore is not the University of Pennsylvania and we cannot by our nature have every experience under
the sun appear as a course offering.
One important way to expand the

scope of multi-culturalism is to work

Swarthmore offers can be complemented by offerings at Haverford
and Bryn Mawr. Yet we cannot get
to this point if we don't eliminate the
logistical barriers to taking courses
at both campuses.

Therefore, in planning for the fucollege needs to examine

thing separate from the traditional
curriculum.
A variety of perspectives, cultures,
and ways of thinking about education must infuse the curriculum, so
that "minority" groups (however we
wish to define them) are not relegated to the margins. They must fill
the gaps of the curriculum where
they have been traditionally excluded. I am not arguing for a sneaky
pedagogy where unsuspecting students are forced to learn about the
"other" whether they like it or not,
but rather a curriculum that recognizes that not teaching from a variety of view points, in a variety of
ways, is inadequate and misrepre-

sentative.
Many classes and departments
here are committedto this approach
to multiculturalism. But some claim
an absolute truth that exists regardless ofperspective. I understand that
this is a debate that may never be
resolved, but I think it is important
to consider the simplicity of one
point of view, and the complexity of
many, when designing a curriculum. I offer the example of the Program in Education because I have
done a good deal of my work at
Swarthmore with them. While at
this point it biases me in favor of
their educational program, the reasons that I have chosen to take so
many classes is because they do not

we should carefully consider expanding the curricular offerings.
If we follow a plan which maximizes what we have first, and then
expands in areas in which are carefully identified as problematic gaps,
then we will be able to offer the best

be good or bad about a liberal arts
education. Something as abstract as
a "multicultural curriculum" does
not mean anything in an empirical
sense. On this campus, it has emerged
as a symbol of diversity in the curriculum.
On this basic level of curricular
content, I consider it to mean studying the culture(s) of someone you
are not. From my perspective a liberal arts education depends on the
"multi," or the plurality of studies
and the variety of points of view.
Multicultural education is the study
of a variety of people, cultures, languages, places, values, arts, expressions, or histories that you are not,
but that exist or used to exist. The
opportunity to study a multicultural
curriculum at Swarthmore is very
visible on this level; one can see a
strong (but not perfect) commitment
to this sort of multicultural education.
The recent addition of several concentrations has added to the official

sors have chosen to include such
"multicultural" issues within their

academic consideration of the field
of education.
My point is that creating an infused curriculum depends a lot on
how one defines his or her field,
department, or course. Professors
who do not teach "multicultural"
courses should consider where they
can include the "multi" in their
classes. This is especially important
within the traditionalfields ofstudy.
In going to various panels and the
CEP forums last year, I have enjoyed hearing professors and students echo each other in concerns
about the college's commitment to
diversity in the curriculum, the student body, and the faculty. All are
important facets in a consideration
of the "multicultural curriculum."
But this process of community exploration is one of the most important aspects of a multicultural curriculum. It is created by the community, everyone has input, and no one
has all the answers.

In my view, multiculturalperspective is a necessary element in our
educational program. We define intellectual excellence and social responsibility as goals ofa Swarthmore
education. Frequently we go on to

recognition of the importance of the
availability of a multicultural education; students will soon be able to
major in Latin American Studies or
Francophone Studies. While I celebrate these additions to the college
catalog, my concerns lie with students who avoid area and ethnic
studies and elect not to take classes
when the subject matter is explicitly
"multicultural." It is dangerous when

describe the ability to think critically and productively about complexity as an important dimension
of both these goals. Multiple cultural approaches to the search for
truth, as well as to the search for
moral principles, are clearly the
source of complexities among the
most challenging we face as students and teachers. We cannot
achieve excellence orresponsibility
without understanding cultural difference and acquiring the capacity
to transcend it. These difficult chal-

the "multicultural" exists as some-

lenges require responses in every

aspect of our academic program—content of the curriculum, experiences in classrooms, courses required of all students.
Several parts of the long-range
planning process now being organized will offer opportunities for
consideration of how best to ensure
that multicultural perspective plays
an appropriate role in all of these
aspects of a Swarthmore education.
One very significant part ofplanning will be to identify gaps in the
curriculum. In consideration ofpossible additions to the curriculum,

whether through Programs offering
Concentrations or through Departments, we need to make decisions
that provide the depth and quality
we expect for any aspect of the academic program at Swarthmore. This
will require hard choices as we cannot present adequately more than a
very small proportion of the cultures
in the world, or even in our own
student body. We will need, for example, to do careful thinking about
the resources we already have to
support proposed new areas. One
reassuring thought for me as an anthropologist is that experience in
learning the shared understandings
of even one culture otherthan one's
own is effective preparation for recognizing and transcending other
cultural boundaries in the future.
I view the Concentrations as important channels for introduction of
cultural content into the curriculum.
Last year I brought a recommendation to the Faculty that budget support for the programs offering Concentrations should be increased so
that the scope and stability of their
offerings could be improved. We
were able to accomplish part of that
recommendation last year and I will
propose the balance to the College
Budget Committee this year. Last
spring the Faculty approved two new
Concentrations, in Francophone
Studies and Latin American Stud-

ies. One focus ofplanning proposed
by the CEP isthe question ofwhether
some programs offering Concentrations should have Faculty appointments, probably jointly with Departments.
The pluralistic perspective of
multiculturalismalso needs to influence the experiences of students and
teachers in our classrooms. Progress
has been made in this area through
the work of JoeMason and Fernando
Chang-Muy, who spent part of their
time in the Provost's Office during
the last three years, and also by fac-

ulty and staff who participated two
years ago in a Mellon seminar on
diversity in the classroom. The need

expanded and continuing
orientation and support for effective
teaching for our increasingly diverse
student body is also one of the topics
proposed for long-range planning
to provide

by the CEP.
The third way that multiculturalism will appear in planning,
if the topics proposed by the CEP
are pursued, is in consideration of
distributionrequirements. I think that
it is unlikely anyone at this College
would be satisfied with a
"Multiculturalism 101"course. Any

attempt to design a requirement to
encourage awareness of culture and
skills to transcend cultural boundaries will itself be an exercise in
complexity worthy of Swarthmore!
The planning process will give us
the opportunity to take on that challenge, and I believe we should.

The words "diversity" and
"multiculturalism" have become
cliches. To many people, the ideas
behind diversity and multiculturalism have been replaced by
the words themselves. Thus, they
see no value in, for example,
multicultural education. At my
former high school, everybody
talked about "celebrating our diver-

sity." To me, this slogan had no
substance, not because no one attempted to discuss the necessity of
diversity, but because the education
taught at my school was not diverse.
Perhaps this stemmed from a lack
of discussion about the need for
multiculturalism in the classroom as
well as the need for it in the student
body. In fact, even at Swarthmore, a
college that stresses its support of
multiculturalism, few people have
discussed the necessity of
multicultural education. Consequently, some may question
multiculturalism's place in our liberal arts education. To them,

multicultural education does not
teach any new ways of thinking or
learning beyond what is currently
taught here. Classes dealing in diverse areas of study do not need to
be taught here, for we are equipped
with the means to learn them after

we graduate.
It may be true that in many types
of academic settings, diversity may
not make sense. I once heard that
"Adam Smith is the basis of all eco-

nomics."
In science, the scientific method

theories. I believe, however, that

diversity we learn not only to empathize, butalso to see reality and look
beyond what we see or blindly accept as truth. Thus, multicultural
education is more than just facts; it
is an important lesson to be learned
by everyone.

Fortunately, many others at Swarthmore believe in the importance of
multicultural education. In the first
volume of the Swarthmore Papers,
President Al B loom eloquently states
that learning about other cultures
"will shake students' assumptions
that theirculture's way is the natural
way to think aboutand react to experience, thattheir culturehas the edge
on clear thinking, on universal ethical understanding, and on subtlety
ofemotionaland aesthetic response."
Clearly then, we need to be more

and broadly educated." As Presi-

dent Bloom remarks, "We cannot
delude ourselves that highly refined
cognitive abilities will translate automatically into the sort of intelligence required."
Multiculturalism also dispels the
misperception that no common
ground exists between cultures, thus
allowing us "to enter other cultural
worlds." Failure to understand this
common ground prevents perspective-taking because of stereotypes
that arise from these perceived differences. Though full understanding and perspective-taking may
occur,
never
believe
I
multiculturalism can provide a good

foundation.
Drawing from personal experience, I can point to misperceptions
that arise because of a lack of perspective-taking. In several conversations, I can often remember when
Black Studies and Asian Studies
have been grouped together. Asian
Studies, unlike Black Studies, does
not focus on the "American" experience; it does not attempt to study the
Asian-American experience.
Grouping Asian Studies with
Black Studies, then, underlies a misunderstanding and a misperception.
There was a failure to understand
that the "Asian" experience in
America is much more complicated
than simply learning about Asian
culture or history. It does not do

justice to the implications of immigrating to America or growing up
Asian.

Thus, there is often a
misperception that Asian and AsianAmerican are synonymous; they are
not. I do not mean to harp on Asian/
Asian-American issues. I am only
trying to bring across a real-life point
that demonstrates why diversity is
crucial to the "Swarthmore education."

Beyond the sheltered lifeofSwarthmore College, we can also draw
on historical examples. In the late
1800's, Japan attempted to bridge
gaps in its knowledge. It combined
what it saw as the best ofall Western
methods and traits with the best of
its own traditions achieving economic and military success fairly
quickly. Their ultimate failure was
not to learn to understand how Western governments thought, acquiring

only Western technology and ideas.
One instance was its victory over
China late last century; Japan felt
entitled to territory in China thinking Western nations would not object,but eventually faced reality and
the West's objections. So, we can
learn all these great ideas and methods currently being taught at Swarthmore, but we may all suffer failures and setbacks, like Japan, by not
learning to see through other perspectives. In failing to do so, we will
be unable to distinguish between
what we perceive as reality and what
actually is reality.
If we were all psychology majors,
we would naturally take other perspectives to understand people's behavior. But a much easier way is to
build diversity into the curriculum
and open people's eyes. Some may
be naturally diplomatic, understanding another person' s perspective, but
not everyone is so diplomatic. They
cannot even fathom how someone
thinks in certain ways and are un-

willing to because of their visual
perceptions, prejudices, and stereotypes.
Swarthmore is at a unique opportunity to provide a multicultural education. Because we have a large number of minorities on campus, we will
inevitably have to face other cultures. Thus, our daily interactions
will be the true test of what we learn
in the classroom and hopefully, re-

inforce those lessons.

Essential to understanding what
"multicultural education" means at
a place like Swarthmore is an understanding of what "culture" means.
As with almost all interesting terms,
defining "culture" is no simple matter. It is used to refer to small neigh-

borhoods and whole continents. It is
used to refer to social phenomena a
decade old and social phenomena
that have been present for several

thousand years. So I don't know
what the "right" definition of "culture" is.

However, I do have an opinion
about the right definition of culture

analysis and assessment of everything in terms of that single dimension. This is much too crude intellectually, and much too impoverished morally, to accomplish the
most profound objectives that a

providing multicultural experience
to students is to enable members of
the dominant culture to understand

In pitting the Western canon
against ethnic studies, tradition
against vogue concepts of political
correctness, the contentious debate
over multiculturalism in the curricu-

lum boils down to the issue ofinclu-

sion and exclusion.
While one camp argues that certain minority groups whohave long
been excludedfrom mainstream academic study should be brought into
the center of focus, another counters
that the inclusion of these groups
will only come at the exclusion of
traditional sources of learning. Both
sides may be right to a certain extent, but nevertheless, I believe they
tend to misunderstand the
overarching purpose of multiculturalism.

To me, a "multicultural" approach
to academic learning should be
grounded in therecognition that one
achieves a better understanding of
the world through the study ofmany
perspectives, and of how various
groupsrespond to each other as well
as to forces within their own communities.
This approach requires not the selective inclusion and exclusion of
certain ideas and concepts, but the
ability to acknowledge thateach distinct group has had a role in shaping
societyand the world as we know it.
So what better way to "know" the
world than to study as many of the
forces that have molded it as possible?
To achieve a more complete understanding, we therefore must examine the histories and experiences
ofhabitually marginalized groups—racial and ethnic minorities, women,
the poor and working class—along
with (not instead of) those of politi-

cal leaders and the white middle
class. Diversity does not, and should
not, have to come at the expense of
more mainstream sources ofknowledge.
Multiculturalism means that a
course focusing on historical constructions of nationalism includes
case studies about Zionism and Zulu
nation formation, in addition to discussing the French Revolution.
Multiculturalism means that the
works of Melville and Thoreau are

juxtaposed with contemporary Native American literary works in a
class on American prose.
Multiculturalism also means that
in a course about antebellum
America, we can study the LincolnDouglas debates as well as the African Americanresistance movement.
Better yet, we can focus on how
antislavery politics were influenced
by slave attempts at resistance and
revolt, for the intersections between
themes and histories are precisely
what provide us with a broader,
deeper knowledge of the world.
The preceding examples are taken
from my own experience with the
curriculum at S warthmore, and demonstrate that we have made significant progress in the implementation
of multiculturalism.
Nevertheless, as long as the debate persists and multiculturalism
continues to be viewed in terms of
inclusion and exclusion, sides winning and losing, the dialogue is not
over. Our task now is to reassert our
commitment to a curriculum that
encompasses a range of perspectives, acknowledging that the best
education is one which seeks to understand the world in all its forms.
Moreover, we must recognize that
some groups and perspectives still
remain unrepresented or grossly
underrepresented in the Swarthmore
curriculum.

For example, although Asian
Americans make up the largest minority group on campus, we currently offer no courses dealing with
the Asian American experience.
What I find even more disturbing is
that classes which cover topics in
American history, literature, politics, and sociology barely (if at all)
touch on therole Asians have had in
shaping this nation's past and
present.
This absence is alarming not simply because, I, along with many of
my Asian American peers, believe it
would be valuable to learn about our
predecessors and issues facing our
community. As individuals seeking
to better understand the society in
which we live, all of us are in a sense
being shortchanged if we are denied
the opportunity to learn about the
experiences of any marginalized
group, be it Asian Americans, African Americans, or Latinos, particularly as they fit into the American
experience.
Therefore, in framing the argument for multiculturalism in the curriculum, we must above all renounce
the view that tradition and diversity
are mutually exclusive entities, and
that one can be included only with
the exclusion of the other. Instead,
we must take on the challenge of
providing a learning experience
broadened and deepened by a complete range of ideas and perspectives.
