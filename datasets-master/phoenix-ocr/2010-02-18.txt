Committee set to review
Hallowell smoking policy

The dissatisfaction of first-year students
with being placed in a smoking dorm will
lead the Housing Committee and the Dean's
Office to consider making Hallowell a nonsmoking dorm. Other factors weighing in on
the decision include the health ofEVS workers

and a decrease in demand for smoking

housing.

College names Liz Braun as
new dean of students

Liz Braun, acting dean of students at
Moun Holyoke College, was named dean of
students on Tuesday by President Rebecca
Chopp. The Dean Search Committee recommended Braun after a search process
that included various interviews and fireside chats. Page 5

failure to disperse, disorderly conduct and
criminal conspiracy. Page 6

Black History Month refocuses in Sams's absence

This year there are fewer Black History

To rest or to work? The
Swattie's eternal question

Wellness columnist Katie Becker discusses ways to cope with sickness during the
school year. Rest is key, even when it
means falling behind in homework. The
nurses at Worth Health Center are especially helpful. Most importantly, take the
time to get better before diving back in to
regular activities. Page 13

Oscar-nominated
film
delves into the psyche of
war
Kathryn Bigelow's film "The Hurt Locker"

brings an emotionality and intensity to its
depiction of war. The film, reviewed by
writer Isaac Han, follows an lED
(Improvised Explosive Device) squad of the
Bravo Company serving in Iraq as they diffuse bombs left by public buildings and city
streets. The film, Han finds, is both pertinent to current events, and a timeless depiction of the psychological traumas faced by
soldiers in wartime. Page 13

Professor of Psychology Barry Schwartz, scheduled to appear on "The Colbert Report" on March 4, lectures during his "Psychology
and Economic Rationality" class.

Tomorrow

gized right-wing analyst who fuses
worldly issues with humor.

BY MENGHAN JIN
mjinl@swarthmore.edu

Professor of Psychology Barry
Schwartz will banter with Emmy and

Peabody
Award-winning
political
satirist Stephen Colbert on March 4.
Schwartz, who is the Dorwin P.
Cartwright Professor of Social Theory
and Social Action, is set to discuss his
book "The Paradox of Choice: Why
More is Less" on Comedy Central's late
night talk show "The Colbert Report."
"The subject of my book is that
although being able to make choices is
essential to human life, when people
have too many choices to make, three
bad things happen," Schwartz said.
"First, we get paralyzed, we can't
choose; second, if we overcome paralysis, we often choose badly, because it's
too complicated; third, if we overcome
paralysis and manage to choose well,

we are less satisfied with the choice
than we would have been if the set of
options was smaller."
Having already made appearances
on "NewsHour" with Jim Lehrer on
PBS, CBS Sunday Morning and various
radio shows, Schwartz said that he
feels comfortable discussing the issues
presented in his book on television.
What will be an obstacle for
Schwartz, however, will be handling
the personality of Stephen Colbert for
approximately five minutes in front of
a live audience
a novel experience
for the psychologist.
"What everyone tells me is the
worst mistake you can make is to try to
be funny. Let the professional do that
and just answer the questions as
straight as you can, if he lets you,"
Schwartz said.
The fake persona that Colbert
adopts on the show is one of an ener-

"The strategy I've heardrecommended is you shouldn't try. Just present
your material and Stephen Colbert will
do his thing, but in the end, the knowledge will get out there," said Professor
Andrew Ward, chair of the psychology
department.

Guests on the show never know what
questions to expect from the host,
though some form of a "gotcha" question is usually thrown out, said
Associate Professor of Linguistics K.
David Harrison, who appeared on "The
Colbert Report" in 2007.
There to discuss endangered languages, Harrison was caught off-guard

when Colbert asked him whether he
was planning on translating his book,
"Why Languages Die," into any dying
languages.

"I couldn't really answer that question," Harrison said, remembering the
experience. "No, the answer is no, but it
sounds silly: If you're advocating for
endangered languages, why wouldn't
you translate your book into those languages?"

Schwartz saw no way that he could
in the next couple
of weeks, except occasionally thinking
about possible scenarios. So far, he has
only been briefed about the day and
time of his appearance, not about particular issues that Colbert wishes to discuss.
"Given [Colbert's] persona, I assume
he's going to come at me as being unAmerican and anti-capitalist, because
choice is the best thing in the world.
That's what I'm anticipating, but he
could surprise me," Schwartz said.
With academic interests ranging
from issues such as decision-making to
therole of ideology in assessing psychoprepare for the show

February 18, 2010

logical theories, Schwartz has already
published several books, including "The
Costs of Living: How Market Freedom
Erodes the Best Things in Life" (2004),
"Learning and Memory" (1991) and "The

Battle for Human Nature: Science,
Morality and Modern Life" (1987).
But the main focus of Schwartz's
appearance on "The Colbert Report"
will be on his most recent book published in 2004, "The Paradox of Choice,"
which intertwines areas of psychology
and economics.
Schwartz argues that Americans are
offered too many choices on a daily
basis and that the decision-making
process that ensues expends too much of
our energy and time.
He doubts that this five-minute interview will further his career in any significant way, but he does anticipate that
his appearance will sell a couple more
copies of "The Paradox of Choice."
"Any time that you have an opportunity to get psychological wisdom out
into the public sphere, assuming it's
done in a legitimate fashion, that's generally a worthwhile endeavor," Ward
said.
But the prospect of facing Stephen
Colbert is still a bit daunting for the
psychology professor of 29 years. "His
main aim is to make you look like an
idiot, so yes, I'm a little bit nervous,"
Schwartz said.
Past and present students of
Schwartz are optimistic about his
upcoming interview.
"If anything, Colbert should be on
his toes," said Melissa Cruz 'lO, a psychology major.

Schwartz's future plans to appear on
television after The Colbert Report are
uncertain. "I'm just waiting for Oprah
to call, before she goes off the air," he
said.

Tuesday
morning,
On
Chopp
President Rebecca
issued a campus-wide e-mail
announcing her selection of
Elizabeth Braun as the college's
new dean of students, bringing
the search process for an
administrator to replace former Dean of Students Jim
Larimore to a close. Braun, the
acting dean of students at
Mount Holyoke College, will be
assuming the position on July
1, 2010.

"Liz brings extraordinary
experience with her to the
College. She is highly regarded,
in her field as an emerging

leader in the areas of academic
support, diversity and community building. She also shares
with us a deep appreciation and
respect for intellectual rigor
and the power of community
and inclusivity.
"In addition, her interpersonal skills are exceptional
enthusiastic, articulate, colleshe
gial, and a strong leader
is, in short, the perfect fit to
become Swarthmore's next
dean of students," Chopp said
in her e-mail to the campus.
Braun plans to visit the campus from Feb. 28 to March 2.
During that time, she hopes to
meet with students, deepen her
search for a preschool for her
four-year-old son Dexter, and
visit the house vacated by
Larimore, where she may be
living.

"Where I'm at right now, it's
finish well at Mount Holyoke and
leave things in a really good
place for everyone there, as you
can imagine," Braun said.
"There's lots to negotiate in
terms of a move. One of my
plans before I come is to get as
much done on my dissertation
as possible. I think what I'm
most looking forward to is
getting to come back to campus

faculty."
Chopp called Braun at her
home on Friday night to give
her the news. "I was ecstatic,"
Braun said. "I kept joking that

all I wanted to know is if
Swarthmore wanted to be my
valentine, and on Friday I
found out that you did! It's a
school that has had its special
place in my heart for a long
time."
As Braun transitions from
Mount Holyoke to Swarthmore,
she will be stepping into the
position in a time of budget
constraints and administrative
turnover.
"I think [her job] will be
pretty similar [to that of Jim
Larimore],

because all the same

things need to be done," said

Provost Constance Hungerford,
the chair of the dean search
committee that was formed in
the fall semester. "I wouldn't
expect there to be major
changes."

The effect of budget constraints on Braun's work at
Swarthmore is at this point,
according to Hungerford, "completely undefined."
"I think she's going to work
wonderfully with us. It's going
to be a delight to have her on
the president's staff. She's
knowledgeable about her own
area, she's smart, she cares
about the same kind of values
that animate the rest of us,"
Hungerford said.
The process of filling the two
remaining positions, vacated
by former Assistant Director of
Student Life and Academic
Advisor Kelly Wilcox and
Director of the BCC Tim Sams,
is not yet underway.
Furthermore, the administration has not begun to conceive of Braun's role in selecting replacements or in organizing alternative arrangements.
"There are a lot of decisions

coming

down the road that
haven't been discussed yet,"
Hungerford said. "There's a lull
period now where we work out
various details."
The search process
Earlier on Friday, the search
committee, which is comprised
of administrators, faculty members, and students, had convened for the last time to discuss the candidates.
"The final decision was
Rebecca's. We met several
times to talk about the material
from everyone else, and all that
decision,"
her
informed
Hungerford said.
Daniel Chung 'lO, a member
of the search committee, added
that while the final decision
rested with Chopp, the committee members played crucial
roles in making the final decision.
"It was ultimately Rebecca
Chopp's decision, but we were
vital voices in voicing our opinions," Chung said. "I feel that
Rebecca was not only justified
as decision-maker but also the
pulse-taker of the committee, so
she was the one who'd be using
common sense to make her
judgment."
He added that all four of the
candidates "were extremely
competitive, but Braun was
chosen because she's a great fit
for Swarthmore."
"She's extremely studentoriented at Mount Holyoke
students could walk in the door
and chat with her if it was an
emergency or talk with her personally," Chung said. "She's
also implemented a lot of programs and overseen a fundamental shift in residential life
at Mount Holyoke. And so she
brings a wealth of administrative experience."
In the final weeks of the
search, the committee used
feedback solicited from the
community in order to gauge
campus opinion and consider

February 18, 2010

concerns raised both by individuals and by groups after two
rounds of the Fireside Chats.
The first round took place in
the fall semester, when student
members of the search committee held a discussion for students to ask questions and
voice concerns. The second
round of the Fireside Chats,
which began with the spring
semester and ended with the
last candidate's open chat with
students, elicited substantially
more feedback from students
and from the community than
the first.
During the second round,
each candidate held separate
meetings with leaders of student groups, faculty, college
staff and Chopp, in addition to
the open chats.
Chung said that the committee received roughly the same
amount of feedback for each
candidate and
about 80
instances offeedback total from
a variety of constituencies.
"I think the comments that
people sent us having participated in those meetings and our
own reports having been at
those meetings were very
important. It was the last stage
of input," Hungerford said.
"And I think Rebecca did a little
more reference-checking, but
those meetings are an important, different stage of a search
process."

"We were looking at the
aggregate or the sense, in some
of the committee members'
words, of the e-mails, or the
vibe of the community," Chung
said.
The consulting agency hired

"All the reference checks

stressed
Chung said.
He added that, as the process
went on, it got more difficult.
"It got particularly intense
as we narrowed it down to four,
because we had sometimes different constituencies advocating or showing strong sentiment for a candidate, or just
because they were so similar in
some respects that we couldn't
tell
we needed to really dig
down deep," he said.
After the final chat with students, the committee "convened
and talked about candidates,
talked about the community's
response to candidates, and
then we had another meeting a
couple weeks later, and we
came to a consensus on Liz
Braun," Chung said. "There
was some dissension, some
agreement, but we were all
agreed on a fundamental level."
Issues looking back
During the time period in
which the fireside chats were
held, students raised concerns
about the role of student press
in covering events. Although
The Phoenix and the Daily
Gazette covered Braun's fireside chat, they were barred
from covering the subsequent
three by the search committee
on the grounds of the confidential nature of the process.
"There could have been better explanation to students
about why we couldn't have

JACQUELINE SMALL

Lang Visiting Professor of Issues for
Social Change George Lakey and 13 other
members of the Casino-Free Philadelphia
group were acquitted on Tuesday for
charges that resulted from a protest
against
predatory
gambling
in
Philadelphia last September.
They were charged with failure to disperse, disorderly conduct and criminal
conspiracy after they protested in front of
the Sugarhouse Casino construction site in
residential -Fishtown by the Delaware
River in Philadelphia on Sept. 29. The trial
was held at the Criminal Justice Center in
Philadelphia.

"The trial was a wonderful success
because of the skill of our lawyer and the
wonderfulness of the judge who realized
the prosecution hadn't made their case,"
said Lakey, who is also a research associate at the Lang Center and teaches a class
in peace and conflict studies.
Lakey said that after he and the other
members of Casino-Free Philadelphia
refused to relocate from the entrance of the
casino construction site they were arrested
and held in custody for 12 hours. "It was a
symbolic blockade," Lakey said. "We wanted to appeal to the citizenry to rise up and
say, 'No, no, no. Not in our city.'" Lakey
...

said that the prosecution showed video

footage of their protest to the judge, who
saw nothing illegal.
"People who know George wouldn'tfind
[this incident] very surprising," said Zein
Nakhoda 'l2, the only student who attended the trial in order to show support for
Lakey. "It is a part of his identity on campus as a person who engages in struggle for
social justice."
"He is known worldwide for both his
actions and training," Executive Director

of the

Center Joy Charlton said of
Lakey. "He is a master of strategies of
social actions."
Casino-Free Philadelphia was started in
2006, and has since then organized grassroots campaigns against the casino industry and corruption in politics, advocating
transparency and civic engagement. Their
aim is to stop casinos from being built in
and bringing their predatory practices to
Lang

Philadelphia.
According to the organization's website,
"the casino industry thrives by increasing
gambling addiction, targeting the poor, and
avoiding paying the costs associated with
crime, bankruptcy and the losses from

other local businesses."
Lakey said that, in addition to the economic strain put on the city by the increases in crime, homelessness and job losses
that are common when casinos are built,
he considers them morally unconscionable.
"What does it mean for a government to

try to raise money by cultivating and pan-

dering to addiction? Is that a society I want

to be a part of?" he said.

In its fight for transparency in politics,
Casino-Free Philadelphia is protesting the
manner in which the gambling legislation
was passed. In an e-mail that invited the
student body to attend the trial earlier this
week, Lakey said that the legislation was

passed "in the dead of night years ago."
The group turned the trial into a political demonstration, calling it "Your
Neighbors on Trial," and organizing a
street rally in support of the 14 arrestees,
who call themselves "Philadelphia's most

honorable citizens" in their open letter to

Philadelphia politicians. The group
includes clergymen, teachers and entrepre-

neurs.

"They wanted to make it a really public
trial which is very strategic because the
more people that show up the more news
hype it will get," Hannah Jones 'l2 said.
Multiple members of the group and the
Philadelphia community attended the rally
and the open trial. "The courtroom was
packed," Nakhoda said. "Casino-Free is
well-organized." Nakhoda, a student
activist, said he went to the trial to show
support for Lakey and to witness a case

"Student [activists] could

learn a lot from them," he said.
Nakhoda emphasized, however, that the

ers in the Ville have discussed the
possibility of allowing students to
use the meal plan at certain local
eateries.
Now, Student Groups Advisor
Benjamin Francis 'l2 said that,
according to Director of Dining
Services Linda McDougall, the
only obstacle to using the meal
plan at restaurants in the Ville is
the college's reluctance to buy the
swipe machines for the businesses.

StuCo is considering buying
the machines themselves, saying
that it could be a significant
improvement for relatively little
money.
Snow policy
Esther Burson 'lO, Educational
Policy Representative, reported

that she has heard many com-

plaints about the college's snow
policy.

"If faon-essential' staff and a lot
of professors are gone, students do
work that is meant for them, like
tasks in the science labs," she
said.
She added that students are
often not informed when professors cancel class and that it is
unfair and unsafe for students
who live off campus to have to
walk to campus only to discover
their class will not be held. Other
students had expressed concerns
that it was unfair that certain staff
members, like those in Dining
Services, are penalized for miss6

planning, preparing, being clear about
your purpose, having support in each other

and outside," she said.
Charlton said that Lakey, a committed
Quaker, was a "strong fit for the college as
a Quaker institution."
Lakey teaches a research seminar in
peace and conflict studies called Strategy
and Nonviolent Struggle, during which
students create a global Internet database
of nonviolent social actions. According to
the course description, the database will
serve activists and scholars around the
world.
He described Casino Free Philadelphia
as 'a grand group a great group of people
to get arrested with," but said he had no
further plans to work with the organization.
Lakey is currently training a
Philadelphia based group, Quakers
Against Mountaintop Removal. He hopes
to involve Swarthmore students in the
group's protest of the removal of mountaintops to gather coal.

Black History Month refocuses in Sams' absence
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY LINDA HOU
rhoul@swarthmore.edu
Last year, Bridget Boakye 'l2 said
that Black History Month was an eyeopening experience for her.
"I particularly remember a performance by KuluMele, an African dance
troupe from Philadelphia, and the way
in which the performance opened a
space for me to comfortably dance," said
Boakye, president of Swarthmore
African Student Association and Black
Cultural Center alumni relations intern.
Yet, according to Associate Dean for
Multicultural Affairs Darryl Smaw, this
February there is a decrease in both the
number and range of events for Black
History Month, partly due to the former
Director of the BCC Tim Sams's departure for NYU Abu Dhabi earlier in the

semester.

"[Black History Month] will not be as
large and broad as it has been in past
years because of the transition that has
taken place," said Smaw, who is now
committing half of his time to the BCC

until a new director is hired. "Also, we
have to look at the cutback of funding for
the events."
Vianca Masucci 'l3 said that she hasn't seen any advertising for Black
History Month.
"A celebration of BHM remains to be
seen at Swarthmore and [the event] hasn't been acknowledged by either stuI haven't seen any
dents or faculty.
advertisement for anything," Masucci
said. "That's a shame at a community
like Swarthmore, where diversity is valued."
BCC House Coordinator Marsha
Davis 'lO said that it seems like there are
...

less events "due to the way they have
been advertised." However, she did say
that there is less diversity this year in
the range of programs.
"If you compare the diversity of last
years events to this year, you will see a
difference," Davis said. "But in terms of
focusing on the number of events,
though Black History Month is a time
set to publicly celebrate the black community, it should not be viewed as the
only opportunity to do this."
Last year, there were ten events related to Black History Month. This year,
there are eight, with one event a Black
Power Panel canceled due to snow.
Half of the events for Black History
Month this year are sponsored by the
Coalition for Free Haiti. There was a
National Moment of Silence for Haiti
and a Haiti Sing-a-Long Parlor Party last
Friday, and there will also be a film
screening of "Potomitan" and a Tri-Co
Haiti Charity Ball.
Jacqueline Bailey-Ross 'l2, a member
of Students of Caribbean Ancestry and
the co-founder of Coalition for Free
Haiti, said that she had also noticed the
lack of events. Bailey-Ross said that for
her, the earthquake in Haiti diverted her
attention from Black History Month.
"I think Black History Month this
year has been sparse in events," BaileyRoss said. "The Haiti relief has shifted
my focus and moved from events about
black history to Haiti."
Bailey-Ross said that aU events related to Haiti have an informational aspect.
"Potomitan" is a film about women in
Haiti, and the Charity Ball will also
have a speaker and a student presentation.
"It's aU going to be educational and

all the events will be based on awareGhana.

Leah Rethy 10, one of the three search
committee members, expressed confusion
regarding the decision to ban coverage.

"It would have been good to have figured out more creative ways if we were
going to ban press, to have more student
involvement. We had a lot but there could
have been more," Rethy said.
StuCo Vice President Deivid Rojas 'll
said that he thought a different approach
could have been taken.
"I wasn't in complete agreement with
the decision the committee took. I think
they acted upon extremes, which was,
'let's have it or not,' and I think that a
compromise could have been made," he

said.

Rojas added that StuCo will be hosting
a conference soon to discuss ways in
which the college community can learn
from this experience and broaden student
participation in search processes.
"We're progressive and open-minded,"
Rojas said. "I think we can find a compromise between keeping a candidate's confidentiality in mind and making sure all
students have access to participate. It's
definitely a decision that's going to affect

us all."

Hungerford stressed the importance of
confidentiality for candidates who would
be content continuing to work aat their
home institutions if they were not selected. She also emphasized that the three students on the search committee, Rethy,
Urooj Khan 'lO and Chung, served as stu-

"I think the three students who served
on the committee were terrific. I know it's
sometimes exasperating that one can't
know more about what's going on, but
those three really were representing a student perspective in our examination of all

the evidence and our eventual deliberations," Hungerford said.
An additional issue was differing interpretations of the purpose of the open
chats.
"It became clear that the purpose of the
fireside chats was for the search committee to see how the candidate interacted
with students, which came as a surprise to
lots of people," Symonds said. "I wish we
had known more about the search process
beforehand."
Rethy said, however, that there was
less of a misinterpretation than there
might appear to be. "Students' opinions
and feedback that was given after seeing
the candidates was considered seriously,
more seriously than I had expected," she
said.
She added that she would hope in the
future that there would be "more fireside
chat type things," emphasizing the importance of student participation in search

Confronting the paradox of the sophomore paper
BY QUITTERIE GOUNOT

made up three of [his] own." For Schwartz,

During this time of the year, sophomore
students are declaring their majors and
drafting their sophomore papers. Alex Lee
'l2 explored disciplines such as philoso-

for intellectual exploration and formal aca-

qgounotl@swarthmore.edu

phy, religion and Japanese before tentaand possibly
tively settling on biology
political science. Selecting a definitive
major has been complicated by the diversity of Lee's interests, as well as by the plurality of voices making different recom...

mendations.
"lf you were to take everyone's suggestions about classes to take seriously, you
would be at Swarthmore for a decade!" Lee
said. Making that final judgment call is a
tricky matter for Lee. "The best thing
about picking a major? When it'll be over!"
This decision marks an important milestone in the college career of Swarthmore
sophomores. As such, it can induce a fair
amount of stress. But what is this decision
really about, and should it warrant all the
fretting?
Even when considering the possibility
to double major or tag on a minor or two,
it seems that choosing a major limits a student's freedom to engage in intellectual
exploration, which many might argue is
the core of the Swarthmore experience.
However, Dean of the Class of 2012 Myrt
Westphal said that during sophomore
year, students have to be "a little more purposeful." It is a time to solidify one's values and interests.
For some sophomores, choosing
majors may be an easier process. "I had
just found my academic passion in a way I
never had before and I just knew," Ben
Schwartz 'l2 said. Schwartz came to
Swarthmore with a passion for linguistics,
instilled in him by an introductory course
he took back in high school. The son of
multilingual parents, Schwartz has "studied a dozen languages in [his] life and

demic specialization.
"It's valuable to have a major to have
some depth of study. Distribution requirements go to breadth
we want you to
learn things you never expected and love
it," Martin Warner, Swarthmore's registrar, said. Yet, intensity and rigor are also
at the core of Swarthmore's mission. "We
also want you to dig deeply into something
and really learn

about that field."

Logically, by
opting for one
major over another, students end
up foregoing one

or more alternatives. Professor

Professor Sunka Simon, coordinator of
the program, said, "I think [interdisciplinary programs] give students more free-

mind-

majors are not as overwhelmingly all-consuming as some might think.
As Warner said, "Major requirements
can [typically] be fulfilled with just eight
credits. This means that Swarthmore students have a whole two years of free elec-

her identity.

But Swarthmore offers students a significant degree of flexibility in planning
their course of study. For instance, interprograms
such
as

Sexuality Studies or American Studies can
be used to broaden and personalize one's
course of study. The Gender and Sexuality

dom and flexibility about what they want
to study and when. They promote greater
connectivity between disciplines." Simon
explained that these programs can be great
for students who can't quite get all they
want intellectually from a single discipline. "Students realize that one discipline
isn't answering or even just asking all of
their questions."
More importantly, interdisciplinary
programs can provide helpful tools to
approach a given subject from a variety of
perspectives and "adopt a more informed
and nuanced stance on it," Simon said. In
her opinion,

linguistics was easily obvious as his calling, but self-awareness does not necessarily address the disconnect between the need

major a student chooses is of relatively little significance. He suggested that what
matters is that "one does make a choice,
not the choice itself."
"You're going to go out and have some
really complicated conversations. You will
need some background," Warner said. "As
an English major [for example,] if you
have taken even one chemistry course,
you will be better up." A broad, liberal-arts
style education

carey

February 18, 2010

can help tap into the "cul-

tural intellectual capital that we implicitly
operate on."
What about students who want to go

into medicine or law? Should they select
classes that prepare them as best as possible for their prospective fields?
Gigi Simeone, pre-med and pre-law
adviser at Swarthmore, presented the prelaw or pre-med factor as another component that students should attempt not to
o ver-intellectualize.
"Some students use their time at
Swarthmore to really dig deep in an area
of lifelong interest, and others pursue an
intellectual passion they may never have
the opportunity to study again," Simeone

said.

"We have pre-meds who major in biology or chemistry, and others who major in
French or art history," she said. "Both
seem to me to be legitimate ways to think
about choosing a major."
So, in the end, how should students
pick a major? "It should be an enterprise of
heart and mind," Schwartz said. He agreed
with Westphal that the sophomore paper
should be an opportunity for personal
reflection. Most importantly, students

should seek something good enough rather
than the best.
"There is no best major," Schwartz
said. "Thinking that way will only lead to

misery."
No matter how much one may try to
reassure them, students are bound to experience stress regarding their choice, especially if they have a wide range of interests. However, students ought to see this
decision as an affirmation, rather than the
denial, of the many possibilities open to
them. Rather than foreclosing any opportunities, it's about keeping possibly meaningful ones open.
"We need to create people who will be
college students for the rest of their lives
and then specialization [won't] matter as
much," Schwartz said.

...

it's enough to reheat last week's leftovers,

but it's still not going to make them clinically acceptable to ingest again. And I
know movies-from-books are generally
horrendous in comparison to the books,
but the film adaptation "Fight Club"
(1999) is really, really good. The other
Palahniuk flick, "Choke" (2008), definitely
leaves a crap-ton to be desired, however.
In Fight Club, we are introduced to acharacter
who
remains
nameless
throughout the story, though many
Palahniuk fans have come to call him
Jack (Edward Norton, "The Incredible
Hulk"), who is leading a quite pathetic
life, deriving the entirety of his "happiness" from Ikea furnishings and every
chronic illness support group within a 40-

mile radius. Jack then comes to haphaz-

ardly befriend Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt,
"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"),
who positively exudes nihilism and every
kind of savoir-faire there is. In short,
Tyler is everything Jack could ever want
to be, and then some. With Tyler at the

soap-out-of-some-human-fat-found-outside-of-a-liposuction-clinic thing). And,
rather miraculously, the film perfectly
preserves the outrageous scenarios that
Palahniuk brings to life with words.
How the director manages this I'm not
entirely sure, but I bet it has to do with
the phenomenal cast. In addition to
Norton and Pitt, Fight Club displays the
fine talents of Helena Bonham Carter,
Meatloafand Jared Leto. It sounds like a
pretty slapdash cast listing, but each
actor portrays the book's characters so
dead-on and so vividly that I hardly had
to change how I originally envisioned

them.

The cinematography has a hand in
making the movie comparable to the book
as well. Any feelings or moods that might
normally become lost in translation from
page to screen are preserved, and even
arguably enhanced. A prime example is
in the microsecond flashes of a smiling
Tyler that one somewhat vaguely remembers seeing multiple times throughout
the film. This is obviously (or perhaps not
so obviously) a play on Tyler's story that
he once worked as a projectionist at a
movie theater and, when bored, would
splice single shots of porn into family
movies.

Fight Club's cinematography also
upholds the one key element that makes
the film version so legitimate: the
of
preservation
formaldehyde-like
Palahniuk's distinctive voice. Nearly all

NOW SHOWING

does.

Since the rendition of Fight Club is so
amazing, I couldn't wait to see Choke, the

movie based on Palahniuk's novel of the
same name. Now, granted, I didn't enjoy
the book Choke quite as much as I
enjoyed reading Fight Club, but it is classic Palahniuk nevertheless and still a
worthwhileread. But as it turns out, even
if I had never seen Fight Club, I would
still loathe Choke all the same because,
quite frankly, that movie blew.
Choke is about a sex addict by the
name of Victor Mancini (Sam Rockwell,
"The Green Mile") who persistently,
though vainly, tries to discover the identity of his father. To keep his dementiaridden mother (Angelica Huston, "The
Royal Tenenbaums") in the intensivecare hospital she needs, Victor feigns
choking at the priciest restaurants. He's

discovered that the rather wealthy performers of the Heimlich maneuver can be
persuaded to send him checks shortly
after. Meanwhile, Victor meets one of his
mother's beautiful doctors, Paige
Marshall (Kelly Mac Donald, "No Country
for Old Men"), who offers not only to pro-

vide a way to cure his mother but also to
translate his mother's diary, which may

reveal who Victor's father really is.
On the whole, the actors do the best
they can. The performances, though

greatly overshadowed by the rest of the

film's shortcomings, aren't bad, but there
is something rudimentary missing from
the characters. This is probably the fault

of the producer or the director, as a lot of
crucial narrations and flashbacks are
completely omitted. Ultimately, none of
the movie's characters are quite as
intriguing as are the book's because they
aren't portrayed in the proper, ultrasatirical Palahniuk way
with witty
commentaries and colorful characterizations. And without Palahniuk's flair, his
stories are pretty foul and creepy. This is
exactly what happens in the film adaptation of Augusten Burroughs's novel
"Running With Scissors." While the film
adaptation of Running With Scissors
(2006) hardly misses a gory detail,
Burroughs' unique and captivating style
fails to translate along with the plot, and
the movie is borderline disturbing.
I know Choke didn't have a blockbuster budget, but it definitely cut corners where it shouldn't have. I'm not saying that Choke had to be a highly refined,
Golden Globe winning masterpiece, but it
didn't even have the interesting quirk or

charm that indie movies are known for.
Nearly all of Palahniuk's magic is in the
presentation of his stories and characters. Therefore, in order to adequately
adapt his writing to another medium, his
voice better damn well carry over, too.
If you haven't seen Fight Club yet, do
so ASAP. (Though I advise you to make
sure you're in an emotionally sound state
that day, as it's kind of pessimistic.)
Choke, on the other hand, should only be
left to times of tremendous boredom
and even then I might suggest you alphabetize your bookshelf instead.

Le Dernier Metro (The Last Metro):
Set in Nazi-occupied Paris during World War H, Francois Truffaut's film
recounts the story of Lucas Steiner (Gerard Depardieu), who plays a Jewish
theater director in hiding, and his beautiful wife Marion Steiner (Catherine
Deneuve), who keeps her husband concealed in their theater cellar while she
takes on his former job as both an actress and director of the company. The
Last Metro refers to the last-scheduled underground train in Paris, which
was imperative for Parisians to catch during the occupation. This was so
they could abide by thelstrict curfew ordained by thelsfazis.
Widely considered one of Truffaut's best films, Le Dernier Metro won 10
Cesars in its native country and received Best Foreign Film nominations in
the Academy Awards and Golden Globes. Unrated. 131 minutes. Monday, 7

Tolkien scholar unearths

about how medium affects work and
whether the adaptation of books to film
bring inevitable changes.
Early on, Shippey quoted Tolkien,
who had once said in speaking about the
adaptation of his books to film that
"canons of narrative art in any medium
can't be wholly different. The problem is
not perceiving where the core of the original lies." But Shippey brings out, perhaps the canons are not wholly different,
but might they be very different?
Shippey cited issues of time and budget as reasons for some of the major shifts
from the original text of the book to the

Students and faculty alike filled the
auditoriums where the lectures given by
Professor Emeritus Tom Shippey, a
medievalist scholar and the leading specialist on J.R.R. Tolkien, took place.
Shippey gave two talks: "Tolkien Book to

Message," and "Rediscovering Middleearth: the Roots ofTolkien's Myths." Both
lectures, delivered with enthusiasm and

Craig
Professor
Williamson, who teaches a class on
Tolkien here at Swarthmore, gave the
introduction to the talks, welcoming
Shippey to "wield his scholarly sword."
Williamson spoke enthusiastically about
Shippey as well as the Tolkien books and
films, referring to them as "an ineffable
gift" and "the greatest fellowship."
Shippey began his first lecture exploring, as he put it, "some of the harder
issues," such as whether the overall effect

The desire of the director to give all of
the characters a journey and Hollywood's
general affinity for "triangles" also effected the change. Shippey also saw the different eras that the books and films were
made a difference, mentioning that a "different attitude in people" underlies a lot
of the changes that took place— speaking
of Jackson as being more sentimental
and Tolkien, a harder person.
In the second lecture, "Rediscovering

his love of this branch of study inspired
his writing. "That was Tolkien," Shippey
said. "He was the only person who took
genuine personal interest in reading the
phone book," he said, speaking to
Tolkien's passion for words.
Tolkien looked at old texts in various
classic languages and, as Shippey said,
"he puzzled over the words and contradictions in ancient texts and this generated the text [of Lord of the Rings] itself."
When there were gaps in the texts he was
reading or the logic of the development of
words had no explanation, Tolkien came
up with his own answers. Thus, the stories were born from these gaps in language and logic.
"It was evident to me how immersed
the speaker was in his field and how passionate he is about philology and
Tolkien," Aakash Suchak 'll, an Honors
English major, said. "I felt the fact that

'Tosh.o' picked up for record-setting second season
BY CAMERON KITTLE
TNHONLINE.COM, FEB. U, 2010
Some comics rag on politicians, some tell personal
stories. Some are clever with words and others scrutinize society. Daniel Tosh makes fun of people. Famous
people, rich people, poor people, black people, white people; there is no linehe won't cross and no group he won't
offend. And that brand of humor won him his own show
on Comedy Central, "Tosh.O."
The program is filmed in front of a green screen,
much like E! Network's "The Soup" with Joel McHale,
and Tosh entertains a live studio audience by playing
popular Internet videos and attacking them with sharp
commentary.
"I just want [the audience] to laugh," he said. "My
show is certainly not serious in any way. It's really just
a group of buddies now, and we come up with horrible
things to say about people."
"Tosh.O" began its second season on Comedy Central
last month and will air 25 episodes. The show airs once
a week every Wednesday at 10:30 p.m. The 25-episode
season is the largest single-season episode pick-up of a
weekly series in the network's history.
"Daniel is extremely talented, incredibly funny and a
perfect fit for our audience," Comedy Central President
Michele Ganeless said. "We're excited about the new
season of 'Tosh.O' and look forward to showcasing him
on all these platforms."
The first season of the show premiered last summer
and averaged L 3 million viewers per episode. It was consistently ranked in the top three spots on cable in its
timeslot within the 18-24 age group.
"Past episode two, this has all been gravy," Tosh said.
"You don't really have to listen to anybody; you just do
what you think is funny and hope other people think it's
funny too."
Tosh started doing stand-up comedy in college at the
University of Central Florida in Orlando. He said he'd
only seen stand-up twice before he tried it himself.
"Like everyone else, I didn't want to work, so I figured now was the time to experiment and try one of
theseridiculous professions," he said.
For a long time afterward, he said he would drive to
"crappy comedy clubs all around the country" and serve
as the MC, making about $l5O per week. His career took
off after four or five years of roughing it and he
appeared on late-night shows with Jay Leno, David
Letterman and Jimmy Kimmel. Eventually, he rose
through theranks of Comedy Central and came out with
his first album, "True Stories I Made Up," in 2005 and
his first DVD special, "Daniel Tosh: Completely
Serious," in 2007.
To go along with the record-setting season of
"Tosh.O," Comedy Central has signed Tosh for another
CD/DVD special, which he says will be out later this
year.

"I don't have a title, but we're taping it June 12 in San
Francisco and the tentative date it will air is Sept. 12,"
he said. "As-soon as it's released on TV, it will come out
on CD and DVD and lead to a U.S. tour of about 50 or 60
cities."
Despite the success, Tosh insists he's not famous.
"Ooh, famous, strong word," he said. "I don't even get
recognized on the street. I'm not famous."
However he's labeled, Tosh has made the 10:30 nightly time slot important again. His jokes are graphic,
insulting and make even the most lenient producers at
Comedy Central blush as they cut and censor out the
worst of his rants.
"If I ever hint that John Travolta might like the company of men, holy cow is that cut right out of the show,"
Tosh said. "It's basically everyone saving their asses
from getting sued."
Tosh said his parents are supportive, but they are
also conservative and often embarrassed by his comments.
"My parents turn a blind eye to my behavior," he
said. "They don't like that I swear and they really hate
anything pornographic. I get a phone call every week
after 'Tosh.O' airs on the East Coastfrom my mom to tell

12

me what jokes she didn't like and to explain anything
she didn't get."
Tosh uses social media to connect with users: he promotes user-submitted videos, answers Twitter questions

his close friends and family members are "obnoxious
conservatives."
"I enjoy being in the company of people who hate my
opinions," he said.

lashes
that sounds about right, doesn't
it? Mono is not nearly as cute when it's
living in your throat, as I have since discovered. With that lovely new knowledge,
I shall dedicate this week's column to
examining the paradox of trying to maintain wellness while being sick.
Although this may sound funny, I'd
much prefer to keep up with my schoolwork than to stay in my dorm room and
rest. I never missed school when I was
younger because I rarely got sick, so I
learned to detest missing class at an early
age. Even if I didn't have that predisposition, Swarthmore has ingrained in me an
unfortunate truth: once you fall behind, it
becomes difficult (and, more importantly,
seems impossible) to catch up.
Thus I found myself lying in a bed in
Worth Health Center the other weekend,
pondering how on earth I could possibly
get necessary rest while not falling hopelessly behind. Needless to say, rest
becomes much less restful when you

spend the entire time thinking about how
stressed you're going to be the second
you're well enough to get up again.

What can you do then, when it seems
like you have to choose between your
health and your assignments and responsibilities? It turns out that you do need to
make that choice: choose your health. In
part, I'm saying that because you probably don't want to remain sick forever. But
in addition, if your ultimate goal is to try
to finish all of your work, it is in your
best interest to get healthy again as soon
as possible. If you continue
your normal schedule,
you will at the very least
remain sick for
much longer and
therefore limit your

a few days to rest or catch up with schoolwork? When thinking about these priorities, keep in mind the ways in which
being sick will affect your capabilities.
The problem set might be the most important priority in your mind, but you might
not be able to concentrate enough to solve

the problems. Try to make realistic priorities. The problem set might be too much,
but you might be able to get all of your
reading out of the way while you rest in
bed. Once you set your priorities, you'll be surprised
by the amount of time

you have, set you up to see the doctor, recommend a course of action and provide
you with necessary treatment aids. If
you're feeling really terrible, you can
stay over. I don't wish severe illness upon
anyone, but it is a massive relief to stay
in the Health Center. You can nap without guilt all day long, a kindly nurse
checks your vitals and brings medication
every few hours, and you can consume all
the juice, soup and crackers your sick little heart desires. While you're there, it's
about as close to having a parent take
care of you as you can get away from
home. The added bonus of staying in the
Health Center is that you are less likely
to overexert yourself. It can be hard to get
Swatties to stop, even while sick. If you're
feeling awful and having a difficult time
getting rest, then go stay for a night at the
Health Center. The enforced rest will help
you realize how much you need it.

sick than getting taken care of by wonderful nurses at the Health Center. No
matter how sick you have been, you eventually will start to feel well enough to face
all of the work that has been piling up
during your rest. The initial period of
feeling better is crucial because you still
have the danger of symptoms returning.
It's to your advantage to continue to act
as though you remain acutely ill and to
get more sleep, drink more fluids, stay
home from events, skip sports practices,
etc. Though it may feel absurd to remain
relatively confined to your room when
you're feeling better, that will give you
the time to catch up on the work you
missed and will help you to fully recover
from your illness.

Oscar-nominated film delves into the psyche of war
BY ISAAC HAN

ihanl@swarthmore.edu

Gone are the days when war
is glorified by movies and when
soldiers are portrayed as impervious to fear and pain. Now in a
more socially conscious world,
we as a society are more apt to
see the horrors of war and consider it a political expression
that put lives in danger for a
dubious good. Kathryn Bigelow's
film "The Hurt Locker" subjects
its audience to a portrayal of
war, in which its soldiers are
subjected to unspeakable horrors and tragedies.
The
follows
an
film
Improvised Explosive Device
(lED) squad of the Bravo
Company serving in Iraq as they
diffuse bombs left by terrorists
near public buildings and in city
streets. The squad consists of
three members: Sgt. Ist Class
William James (Jeremy Renner),
Sgt.
JT Sanborn (Anthony
Mackie) and Spc. Owen Eldridge
(Brian Geragthy). Each person
has his own initial strength
going into the war but by the end
of the film, each one is systematically broken down by the war.
The strongest of the three,
James, is seemingly impervious
to the fears of his job, probably
since he has diffused more than

THE PHOENIX

800 bombs over his many tours
of duty. In one scene, he takes off
his protective gear. Saying that
he wants to be comfortable when
he dies, he acknowledges the
immense difficulty of one car
bomb he has to diffuse. Even he
is brought to tears by the end of

the movie.
Each scene in which James
has to suit up and diffuse the
bomb by hand is powerfully
tense and dramatic. As James
has to gingerly approach each
bomb and slowly pick at the
wires, we take each step and
breath that he takes, feel the fear
and horror and sense that the
worst is one infinitesimal mistake away. The fact that the
movie is so uncomfortable to sit
through is a testament to the
flawless execution of Bigelow's
vision to help us to see the horrors faced by each soldier in
Iraq.

What adds to the intensity of
these scenes is the ruthless cinematography that shows the enormity of each explosion. In the
opening scene, Staff Sgt. Matt
Thompson, James's predecessor,
is blown to bits when a man sets
the bomb off with his cell phone
with Thompson well inside the
blast radius. Realizing the danger of the man with the cell
phone, Thompson turns to run

away from the bomb. However

protected he is by his gear, he

can't escape in time, and in a
spectacular slow-motion wideangle shot, he is immediately
engulfed by the flames that
launch him forward, his suit visibly filling with blood as he is
tossed to the ground. The deliberate framing of each explosion
so that it fills the screen menacingly and the camera showing
each bomb victim's death in one

full take, without a cutaway,
establishes the power of each
bomb, magnifying each action as
more important and dramatic
than the last.
In portraying the activities of
wartime in such a traumatizing
fashion, the film criticizes the
necessity of war. The film is really about the effect that war has
on the soldiers who have to
brave those horrors and how
futile the attempts are to subdue
the terrorists. The bombs never
seem to stop coming, even
extending beyond the service
time of the Bravo Company into
the much longer service time of
the Delta Company that James
joins at the end of the movie.
In addition, the terrorists
never manifest themselves in the
film. They are kept as a mysterious presence in the film that
keeps creating these threats. The

February 18, 2010

fact that the terrorists are left
incognito focuses the film on the
soldiers, some of who fail to reintegrate into society after serving
the war. James rejoins the war
as part of the Delta Company
after a failed attempt to be a
meaningful part of his family
back home, and we leave the
movie with him walking toward
another bomb, his future in suspense.

"The Hurt Locker" is an

immensely powerful movie that

is timeless in its capture of the

psychological horrors faced by

soldiers in wartime. It is a film
that indicates the redefinition of
the war movie genre that looks
to criticize war and portray it as
foolish and futile, rather than
glorify it as an expression of true
masculinity. In its essence, it is a
well-crafted film that jerks the
emotions of its viewers through
terror and tragedy while provoking discussion of the effects of
war on the human psyche.

The study has been widely covered
in the media but unfortunately is vulnerable to misrepresentation. It must
not be taken out of context to stop the
laudable efforts of the Obama administration to curb the use of abstinenceonly programs in favor of comprehensive sexual education.
The United States has the highest
rate of teenage pregnancy among developed
countries. Specifically, the
Guttmacher Institute has estimated the
rate to be 7L5 teenage pregnancies per
1,000 women of ages 15-19 in the year

Importantly, the authors admit that

Politicians as well as the media might

We believe that teenagers should

learn about all commonly used methods
of birth control, as well as alternatives
to contraceptives, to delay sexual activity and reduce the chance of contracting HIV/AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases. This should include
suggesting the possibility to abstain or
to use the coitus interruptus method,
but the primary focus should lie on
teaching students about the use of contraceptives and their relative effectiveness.
We are encouraged by the Obama
administration's move away from abstinence-only-until-marriage sexual education. We hope that it will correctly
choose to ignore this latest study if proponents of abstinence-only-until-marriage education try to use it to bolster
their case.
Lastly, we must not forget the role of
parents must play in educating their
children. We cannot rely solely on
schools to teach our teenagers to consider the consequences of their sexual
activity and to help themavoid unwanted outcomes.

implicitly

or explicitly. My
friends seem well-informed on
most issues pertinent to the 21st
century citizen, and will usually
give their opinion on any issue I
wish to discuss both in class and
out of it.
But countermanding this
strong ethic of dialogue, there is
also a desire not to offend.
Because Swarthmore is such a
liberal campus, and people are
constantly making a noble effort
to be respectful, those who
would otherwise voice an unpopular decision must sometimes
hold their tongue. This silencing
of minority opinions goes
against
everything
that
Swarthmore aspires to represent, as a mainstay of diversity
and as a leader on positive world
change.

That is why campus activism
is a necessary part of our life
here at Swarthmore. Campus
activism acts as a forum for dialogue, free from the fetters of
personal obligation that would
otherwise prevent us from saying what we really believe.
Campus activist groups also act
as a tool for concrete change,
from organizing fundraisers, to
creating petitions, to organizing
trips to Washington to demon-

strate our resolve before our

government. The fact that we
have campus activism shows
that students really care and

THE PHOENIX

that they are willing to back up
their words with actions.
Far be it from me to say that
campus activism is always a
good thing. After talking to a
senior who graduated last year
about the politics of the IsraelPalestine debate on campus, I
found out that a few years ago
the debate got so heated that it
became difficultfor some groups
affiliated with the debate to
remain in existence. I recognize
the power of debate to ruin
friendships and to hurt feelings.
But to accuse the groups

themselves of being the source of
the conflict is misleading. If anything, campus activist groups
have a greater power to affect

reconciliation between the two
sides than any individual or
unorganized campus group, by
bringing in experts on both sides
of the issue to give their own
opinions. Furthermore, they
have the ability to educate people on both sides of the issue;

and the more educated we are
about an issue the more able we
are to appreciate the opinions of
those who disagree with us. It is
when people allow the debate to
interfere with their feelings
about a person that the feelings
become hurt and friendships
become broken. But this has

one cannot form an opinion by
reading these sources. Do not

become so disillusioned with the
debate that you forgo defending
a side, and thus give up your
power to make an opinion, and
to define your own truth. Having
an opinion based on something
is far superior to having no opinion, based on nothing.
In the end it is the role of
these campus activist groups to
help students make a decision

about the issues that affect all of
us, as defenders of human rights
and as guardians of our future.

These campus groups engage

students in dialogue about pertinent issues, but they also channel students' energies into paths
by which they can actually make
a difference. As former secretary
general Kofi Annan said in his
last address to the United
Nations Council, "Let's not content ourselves to grand state-

ments of principle. We must
work to make human rights a
reality in each country." Be it
human rights, or any other
issue, local or global, we must
work to make a new reality. The

existence of campus activist
groups means that we can work,
and are working, toward that

reality.

LETTER, OP-ED AND COMMENT POLICY

Questioning Phoenix policy
To The Editor:
The Phoenix should not have published
the name of the individual involved in last
week's article "Student arrested at Bryn
Mawr." The official Phoenix policy on
publishing articles about legal charges
against students is that: "The Phoenix
does not publish the names of students
who receive police citations, although it
does reserve the right to publish the
names of any students who are arrested by
the police."
The policy requires an editorial decision to exercise the right to publish
names. Speaking from our individual, personal experiences as student journalists
who have worked at both The
Phoenix and The Daily Gazette, we believe
that publishing the story was a poor editorial decision.
This story has no journalistic worth.
Because the crime was nonviolent and
involved no other parties, there is no evidence that this student will pose a threat
to anyone. Furthermore, the arrest
described in the article occurred almost
two weeks prior to its coverage in The
Phoenix, at a location (Bryn Mawr) outside both the college and even the borough
of Swarthmore. It is neither timely nor
relevant to the Swarthmore community.
In Pennsylvania, public drunkenness is

16

characterized as intoxication "to the
degree that [the individual] may endanger
himself or other persons or property, or
annoy persons in his vicinity." (C.S.A. §
5505)

Someone charged with this crime may
simply have been drunk in the wrong
place at the wrong time. Though
Swarthmore is an insular community, the
online publication of the story with the

student's name opens this accusation up
to the outside world. Yet there is no compelling reason why The Phoenix should
have made this incident an object of public scrutiny.
This article only cursorily embodies
the values of the profession—objectivity
and freedom of information—while forgetting to what ends those values should be
directed.
How does this clarify or inform an
important discourse on campus? How does
this provide the community with information relevant to how it lives and conducts
its business? How does this shine light on
something important that is muddled in
confusion? It does none of these things.
We believe that The Phoenix should
retract the story from its online archives
and apologize to the student in question.

Lack of incentives hinders the Tri-Co relationship

of incentives. If the incentives existed for
students to take advantage of the Tri-Co,
they would, just as students in the Bi-Co
take advantage of the Bi-Co. It's true that
the Tri-Co vans are stiflingly infrequent,
but they can afford to be so because so few
students use them. In the Bi-Co, if the
buses ran so infrequently, it would be a
major obstacle in the way of the social and
academic lives of many students.
So, we have a chickenand the egg problem. The burdens placed before Tri-Co students will also be removed when more students are taking advantage of the Tri-Co. If
the Swarthmore van consistently runs out
of space, the Blue Bus will have to run
more of them; if more students are taking
more classes through the Tri-Co, the buses
will have to run more frequently. If more
students are eating meals through the TriCo, the dining services will have to
rearrange their system. Before any of that
happens, though, we must incentivize
Swarthmore students to go to the Bi-Co,
and vice versa.
Bryn Mawr and Haverford actively
promote the Bi-Co relationship in a few
crucial ways. Departments at Haverford

i

I must disagree with your article
chiefly in that the problem with Tri-Co
relations is not the number of burdens
placed upon students, but rather the lack

between Haverford and Bryn Mawr. Some
departments, like archaeology, architecture, geology, and cities, exist only at Bryn
Mawr, while others, like religion and
music, exist exclusively at Haverford.
Some incentives like these do exist
already for Tri-Co students, but they target too small a portion of the respective
student bodies. Swarthmore has a lot to
offer the Bi-Co; among other things,
Swarthmore boasts a substantial technical theater, an engineering department
and a strong linguistics department.
Swarthmore does indeed get a fair number of Bi-Co students coming over for the
theater (myself among them), but when
linguistics and engineering are concerned, most students decide that it's too
much trouble to travel to Swarthmore
every day and never get involved.
The incentives of the Bi-Co extend
beyond academics, though, and this is
where Tri-Co relations and Bi-Co relations
diverge. Rather than being based at one
school, many of the largest social groups
at the Bi-Co are fully Bi-Co organizations.
One of the best examples is Greasepaint, a
musical theater organization, which performs exclusively at Bryn Mawr although
it is funded exclusively by Haverford's
student government. Another good example is "The Bi-College News" (affectionately known as the "Bi-Co"), Haverford and
Bryn Mawr's joint newspaper. Parties are

and Bryn Mawr typically split their
responsibilities: Haverford biology focuses on microbiology, whereas Bryn Mawr
focuses on macrobiology. Math at Bryn
Mawr is generally applied, whereas math
at Haverford is generally theoretical, and
the math colloquium alternates weekly

:

To the Editor:
I stumbled entirely by chance upon the
article in the Jan. 28 edition of the
Phoenix "Urging the importance of the
Tri-Co relationship," and as a student on
the other side of the Swarthmore van,
with very similar opinions but a very different perspective, I feel compelled to

also generally open to students from both
schools, and the two colleges still share
many traditions, although not as many as
they did when Haverford was men-only.
As a result, it's very common for students at Bryh Mawr to travel to Haverford
for a one-time event, which is much easier
than traveling every day for a class.
Likewise, if students at the Bi-Co were
aware
at
of events happening
Swarthmore, and vice versa,'there would
be a great deal more traffic between the
schools. For events like these, it is emphatically not a problem of distances or burdens, but rather a problem of accessibility.
Thus, I suggest three remedies:
L The implementation of a Tri-Co
events calendar.
2. Support for Tri-Co groups and activities.
3. Dialogue between The Phoenix and
the Bi-Co News.
L I decided to respond to your editorial
partly because I am already working on
creating a Tri-Co events calendar. FIG
(FIG Is Good) is the student computing
group at Haverford, and maintains
go.haverford.edu, known as the GO!
Boards. The Go! Boards are primarily a
set of school-wide forums read commonly
by nearly everyone (even by many staff
members), although go.haverford.edu also
sports an events calendar monitored by

the director of student activities. As a
member of FIG, I want to implement Go
board equivalents for Bryn Mawr and
Swarthmore, as well as a set of boards and
a calendar for the Tri-Co.
I don't expect that what works for
Haverford will work perfectly for Bryn
Mawr and Swarthmore, but the Bryn

Mawr and Swarthmore students I have
talked to seem to like the idea.
2. Here I may be more than a little bit
biased. As I said, I am involved in a lot of
theater, and I intend to direct the musical
Assassins by Stephen Sondheim in the
fall. From what I have gathered, it will be
the first Tri-Co show in a long time. The
musical will hopefully bring together a
number of students from all three colleges.

If I can divorce my opinions from my
own interests, these are the kinds of
events that need support. The existence of
a Tri-Co theater production, or occasional
Tri-Co department colloquia or teas, or
Tri-Co social events, etc., would go a long
way toward increasing traffic between the
schools, creating friendships between the
schools and thereby familiarizing the various student bodies with the other campuses.
3. For starters,

I think that the Bi-Co
could dedicate a little bit of space to advertising events at Swarthmore and vice
versa. A dialogue between the newspapers
would also be an interesting way to get
people more comfortable with the Tri-Co. I
would leave it to the newspapers to develop this idea and pursue it if they wish.
Naturally, the most important thing
will be curiosity and open-mindedness on
the part of the student bodies. I can't guarantee that Tri-Co relations will ever be
stronger than they are right now, but I
think that there are a few easy ways (like
those above) to increase interest in the
Tri-Co, which might ultimately lead to
more frequent busing and stronger relations overall.

and the following years saw the
rate of MMR vaccinations in the
U.K. drop to 84 percent (in some
places, as low as 61 percent),
according to Britain's National
Health Service. These levels are
insufficient to prevent a serious
outbreak of those diseases, and
the region has experienced an
explosion of measles and
mumps cases. Measles cases
have been occurring at a rate 13
times its 1998 level; mumps at a
rate 37 times greater. Children
are suffering, some even dying,
because of the massive hysteria
this study inspired.
This seems an unfortunate
but understandable reaction to
the possibility of the MMR vaccine causing autism, but there's
one serious problem: the study
is rubbish.
Immediately after it was
published, the General Medical
Council began an investigation
(MMR)

THE PHOENIX

into the study's claims, the
methods used and accusations
of unethical conduct from its
lead author, Dr. Andrew
Wakefield. Ten of the 13 original
authors have since denounced
the study, and on Feb. 2, the
journal that originally published the study fully retracted
it. On Jan. 28, the General
Medical Council ruled that
Wakefield acted "dishonestly
and irresponsibly" during his
research, and he had behaved
with "callous disregard for the
distress and pain the children
might suffer."
Since that first study, no
other scientists have been able
to reproduce the results. A host
of large-scale studies have
failed to find any evidence for
the supposed link between the
vaccine and autism. In fact, it
seems the only support for this
theory comes from wild, pseudoscientific speculation and
anecdotal evidence from scared
parents.
But this conspiracy theory
still has traction. Vaccination
rates in the U.K. haven't recovered from that initial slump,
and the U.S. isn't immune to the
same phenomenon.

Though not as wide-spread,
fear over the supposed dangers
of vaccines has parents wondering whether they are worth the
risk. According to the Center
for Disease Control, infant vaccination rates are still sitting
around a record high, with
about 1 percent of children lacking the recommended immunizations, but the rate for the
MMR vaccine is going down.
And, of course, measles and
mumps cases are increasing
sharply as a result.
We aren't seeing anywhere
near the epidemics that plague
the U.K., but if the current
trend continues, there's no reason to think the same thing
won't happen here. We're headed for a serious outbreak of diseases that should be headed for
extinction, all because of an
ignorant hysteria.

Celebrities with more money
than sense, such as Jim Carrey
and Jenny McCarthy, are using
their media clout to support
this conspiracy theory and stir
up
vaccination fears. It's
absolutely reprehensible these
apparently thinking
people
they know more than the scien-

tific and medical communities

February 18, 2010

are using their position to
put children in harm of completely preventable diseases.
They attack the "medical establishment" as a dogmatic institution trying to silence dissenting
voices, and they point to other
discredited or inconclusive
studies to support their theories.
And it's not just these fears.
Groups have found potential
dangers in everything from the
amount of vaccinations given to
the timing of those injections.
None of these claims have been
supported by valid studies
though it's worth noting none
specifically
have
been
debunked either.
Scared patients hear popular
voices talking about the "science" that shows potential dangers in childhood vaccines, and
they listen. They do what any
responsible parent would do in
that situation, and keep their
children from "unnecessary
and potentially dangerous"

injections. Unfortunately, in
this case, what they're ultimately doing is putting their children at risk to horrible, pre-

ventable diseases because of a
conspiracy theory with no con-

elusive scientific backing.
This is not to say the effect of
vaccines should not be further
explored. We need to know
everything we can about the
medicines we inject in ourselves at these vulnerable ages.
Concerns about the interaction
between infant vaccines, or the
effects of the fever reducers
they are packaged with, are
valid avenues of needed
research.

It's simply that it's better to
be safe in the mean time. Until
the time a conclusive link is
found, or concerns are at least
partially validated, we need to
vaccinate our children. Why
risk the health of your child on
a potentially bogus theory? And
even if vaccines are found to
have certain negative effects,
the benefits of protection from
these diseases, the prevention
of outbreaks and the potential
eradication of the diseases in
their entirety are worth a lot of
side-effects.
With the autism link all but
debunked and other concerns
lacking any conclusive proof, it
is irresponsible not to give your
children every chance of a
healthy future possible.

Women split weekend games postponed by weather

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY VICTOR BRADY
vbradyl@swarthmore.edu

After a nine-day layoff, with two games
postponed as one snowstorm after another
blasted Swarthmore College and forced
the Centennial Conference to reschedule
events,
the
intercollegiate
Garnet
women's basketball team returned to
defeating
action on Friday,
the
Washington College Shorewomen before
falling to the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays on
Monday evening.
The Garnet had been scheduled to host
Johns Hopkins on Feb. 6 and Washington
on Feb. 9, but both games were postponed
as snow covered the Mid-Atlantic region.
With just one game remaining on the
schedule, the Garnet (11-13,8-11 CC) will be
unable to equal their 13-12 record from last
season. The Garnet remain steadfast in
their desire to end the season on a winning
note, though winter has forced the team to
remain mentally tough. Pam Costello 'lO
said that the last few weeks "have been
kind of crazy in terms of our schedule
however, I think that we have been able to
stay focused and ready to play."
The Garnet knew that they would need
to be focused against the Blue Jays and
Shorewomen, as both teams defeated the
Garnet earlier this year, with Hopkins hit...

ting eight 3-pointers and Washington hitting 12 in their respective victories.

On Friday, the Garnet were led by Eliza
Polli 'l3 and Madeline Ross 'l3, who each
scored 14 points in a 65-69 victory. Up just
two points with less than five minutes to
play, Swarthmore seized the upper hand
as Polli and Genny Pezzola 'l2 hit 3-pointers on consecutive possessions.
Against the Blue Jays, the Garnet went
down 22 points in the first half of play
before battling back in the second half to
cut the lead to four. But Hopkins was able
to hold on for a 64-54 victory as the Blue
Jays beat the Garnet for the 12th time in
the team's last 13 head-to-head matchups.
Coach Renee DeVarney views the loss
to Hopkins as an important learning experience for the team. "We have to be ready
Hopkins upset the top
for everything
...

team [in the Centennial Conference,
McDaniel] on Friday and then lost to
Haverford on Saturday. So they are mad,
and still trying to get a bye in to the
Conference playoffs, and they came out
[strong] to begin the game."
After the initial onslaught, the Garnet
women were able to open the second half
on a run to cut the game to single digits.
"We were able to regroup, but it was too
big of a hole to come out of. But I'm very
happy that we came back out and played
hard, and gave them a good game after
halftime," DeVarney said.
When the Garnet last played Hopkins,
back in early December, Kathryn

Stockbower 'll and Ceylan Bodur 'll
scored 32 of the Garnet's first 34 points.
Monday was a different story, as the
Garnet used balanced scoring to claw back
into the game in the second half. "Since
the second semester, we have been a lot
better with balanced scoring. Ross and
Polli have really contributed and Pam
Costello 'lO has been a bigger factor as
well. The balance has been really helpful,"
DeVarney said.
Though the Garnet has lost several

heartbreakers this year, the season has
not been without highlights. In the conference, Swarthmore won two road games
with last second shots and survived two
overtimes to defeat Franklin and Marshall
on the road.
Costello added another
moment, which came over New Year's
weekend, as the Garnet won the Catholic
University
America/Days
of
Inn
Tournament. "Winning the Catholic tournament was really big for our team.
Catholic is a good team and it is really fulfilling to go away on a team bonding trip
and come back with a championship trophy."

Summer Miller-Walfish 'll believes
that the Garnet can build upon the
resilience that they showed in Lancaster.
"[ln beating Franklin and Marshall on
their home court], we showed ourselves
that we are capable of not giving up and
sticking it out to get a tough win. These

are lessons that I think are going to be
very good for us to carry into next season," she said. .
Though Costello has just one final
game left with the team, she has made a
lasting impression on the Garnet program.
year, I tried to
"Over the course of
teach my teammates a lot of things. [I
think that both Lisa Schumacher 10 and I]
showed our dedication to the team, our
love for the game and our willingness to
put time and effort into making the team
better. Hopefully this has prepared the
younger players on our team for the years
to come."

The Garnet concludes the year against
rival Haverford at Tarble Pavilion on
Saturday, where the Garnet is just 3-7 on
the year. The game will be broadcast
online on the Garnet Sports Network
through athletics.swarthmore.edu.
In preparation for this game and to
honor all of the Swarthmore athletic
teams,''the Student Athletic Advisory
Committee will be hosting a pep rally at
Tarble Pavilion on Friday from 9-11 p.m.
The pep rally is open to the entire campus
and will feature performances from
Sixteen Feet, Mixed Company and the
MariachiBand. In addition, there will be
free food and t-shirts, a 50-50 raffle with

proceeds going to Haitian earthquake
relief and the name of the Phoenix will be
revealed.

have
ever
known.

'^■■"■^^^^■"■■■■■■■l

Danny

Walker will be playing their final game.
Our team will never be the same without
them.
I came to Swarthmore for two reasons: to play basketball and to be Matt
Allen's teammate. I stayed with him on
my recruiting visits, and from that night
on, I knew I wanted to be at Swat. With
only one game left with Matt, I'm feeling
a little distraught, a bit scared and generally worried about what life without
"Mallen" will be like. For two years,
Matt's been my mentor, my motivator
and one of my greatest friends. From a
purely selfish standpoint, I don't want
him to graduate. I know he's going to
hate this article because that's just the
kind of guy he is, completely humble
without an ounce of ego in him, but it's
his senior night in a couple of days and
the best way I know how to honor him is
to write.
There's something different about
Matt Allen that most people don't appreciate. Most of us know he "works hard"
and that he loves basketball, but when
you've done his workouts and been
around him 24/7 like I have, "hard worker" doesn't even scratch the surface of
Matt's personality. What I hope will be
Matt's legacy, and this is the greatest
compliment that I can possibly give, is
that he will be remembered as a true
leader and a man of unstoppable integrity
Most people claim that they do their
best, and I believe them when they teU
me that, because they honestly think
they are doing all they can. The thing
about Matt is that while he's dripping
sweat, hunched over in exhaustion after
an excruciating workout, he knows that
he hasn't done his best because you can
always do more. That's the biggest thing
I've learned from Matt: not to accept the
challenges put in front of you, to instead
eagerly search for new ways to challenge
yourself. He's constantly expanding his
idea of what it means to do your best,
which literally permeates into everything that he does.
To uphold his standards, Matt has
developed a stronger discipline than any
person I have ever met. He had never
skipped a class until this February when
he missed one to accept an award
at
acknowledging
his
career
Swarthmore. And his physical discipline
shows because he takes his shirt off way
too often, but there's more to his commitment.
I'll never forget when I went with him
to Brown last spring. Matt introduced
me to all of his friends and made me feel
like I had known them for years. At the
end of the weekend, I felt more comfortable around Matt's friends than I did
around my buddy whom I was visiting.
It's the little things that extend Matt's
integrity beyond the basketball court. He

THE PHOENIX

makes you feel like the only person in
the room when he's talking to you, and
he celebrates the gold in everybody's
personality. His lightness of being and
authentic positivity make his presence a
breath of fresh air. He's the kind of person that inspires you to be better, the
kind of person with 10 times more compliments than complaints.
It took me a long time to understand
Danny Walker, and to be honest, I'm still
not an expert, but that's why being his
teammate has been such a rewarding
experience. The thing about Danny is
that he is a beacon of self-expression.
Going beyond what most people recognize about his creativity—his stunning
and infinitely skill artwork—is his ability to craft his opinions and actions in the
same way. Being his teammate is literally like watching art in motion. I feel like
a fifth grader on my field trip to MOMA
staring blankly at what I understand to
be beautiful, my appreciation growing
by the second as my confidence in what

it means diminishes.
Danny is a big kid, and when he's
happy he'll show it, and when he's sad,
he'll show it. There's no pretense with
him, no insincerity—only pure honesty.
Through it all, you can count on him to
sing at a ridiculously high volume to his
iPod and to play Pokemon until he falls
asleep. These simple things that Danny
does have taught me the most. I've
learned from Danny to do what I do
regardless, not to be afraid of consequences or to withhold myself to stay
within any pre-constructed bounds.
This summer, when Danny and I
played on the same summer league team,
he saw that I wasn't playing too well. He
didn't say anything to me; he let me be,
let me develop on my own. In my secondto-last game, though, I had my best game
of the summer and we ended up winning
in overtime. After that game, Danny told
me he saw me doing my thing and playing my game. From Danny, this small
compliment meant the world to me
because he showed me when I was being
true to myself. He has this remarkable
ability to recognize when you're being
true and when you're shortchanging
yourself. How he knows my personality
better than I do I have no idea, but I can
assure you that will be missed next season.
Danny wanted to be an artist when he
entered Swarthmore; he created and
found a way to do what he loves most
while at Swarthmore, and there is no
person I have more confidence in than
Danny to make money doing something
he loves when he leaves Swarthmore.
And how do I know this? Because he's
the master of creativity. Wherever he is,
he creates. Whether that be creating
something out of nothing while I'm
guarding him and dropping buckets on
my face or creating the greatest career a
walk-on has ever had in Swarthmore's
history from nothing but a pure passion
for basketball, Danny will make something great out of what he has.
Saturday at 4:00 p.m. marks the last
time anybody will get a chance to see
Matt and Danny play ball for
Swarthmore. Whether you know them
well or not, I encourage you to come out
and see them play. It's a fantastic opportunity to show your appreciation and
support for two of Swarthmore's greatest
people.

Men's basketball catches fire after chilly weekend
BY MARK CHIN

mchin2@swarthmore.edu

Two of the games that the Swarthmore
men's basketball team was scheduled to
play last week were postponed because of
the recent snowstorms. As a result, the
Garnet found themselves playing three
games over a four-day period this past
weekend, something that they had not
done all season.
But the weather outside Tarble
Pavilion wasn't the only thing that was
cold when the Washington College
Shoremen (11-9, 9-7 CC) arrived last
Friday, after snow forced the game to be
moved from Wednesday.
The Garnet men shot only 29.7 percent
from the field against Washington College
as they fell to the Shoremen 73-64. Will
Gates 'l3 led the team in points and
rebounds, scoring 19 and grabbing nine
boards. Yet even Gates's points were hard
earned, as he sank only five of his 24 field
goal attempts for the game. Though the
Garnet only trailed by four points at the
end of the first half, the Shoremen were
able to overcome any attempt at a comeback by shooting markedly better than the
Garnet, who held comparable stats in
almost every other category besides shooting percentage. Washington College shot
50 percent from the field in the second
half, whereas the Garnet sank only 27.5
percent of their shots in the same frame.
Saturday's game at Dickinson (4-17, 4-12
CC) was more of the same story, but this
time the Garnet squandered a first-half
lead by having a poor offensive showing in
the second half, and fell to the Red Devils
52-46. Heading into the second quarter
with a 25-21 lead, Swarthmore proceeded
to shoot 19.4 percent from the field and 12.5
percent from behind the three-point line
the remainder of the game.
Though Dickinson only connected on
two three-point attempts the entire game,
the Red Devils capitalized on their freethrows, sinking 14 of 19 attempts in the
second half alone. Led by Matt Dolan 'll,
who scored 16 points on just four field goal
attempts but 20 free throw attempts,
Dickinson was able to overcome the
Garnet in the second half by getting to the
charity stripe.

Though the two losses eliminated
Swarthmore from playoff contention, the
Garnet wasn't done shaking up the playoff
picture for the rest of the conference. The
team rebounded Monday night to defeat
Johns Hopkins (11-12, 7-9 CC) 55-51, which
allowed Ursinus, Muhlenberg and
Gettysburg College to clinch playoff spots.
The Garnet trailed only by one point at
the end of the first half, and were able to
keep the game close and overtake the Blue
Jays in the second half, something that the
team could not say for their earlier games
that weekend. Swarthmore's offense,
caught fire in the second half, contributed 11 points off free-throws and 20
points off 52.9 percent shooting. This
proved to be the difference maker on
Monday night, as the team's defense once
again proved solid, especially toward the
end of regulation play.
Though the postponements led to some
hectic scheduling of practices and games,
most of the players did not feel as though
the lack of rest affected execution on the
court. Forward Sam Lacy 11, who scored
seven points and grabbed six rebounds
against Johns Hopkins in addition to caus-

20

ing some key turnovers late in the game,
said, "The rescheduled games did not
make for an easy weekend, but it certainly
wasn't the cause of our poor play
...

Practices were shifted around because of
the snow, but our practices the week leading up to Washington were generally pretty strong."
Captain Matt Allen
think the three games

10 added, "I don't
in four days thing
really affected us that much, to be honest.
We might have had slightly tired legs
against Dickinson on Saturday, but that
probably has just as much to do with the
long road trip over to Dickinson. I would
say the long layoff probably was the
biggest thing for us, because our games
kept getting pushed back so we didn't play
for overa week. It has certainly been crazy
but I don't think we won or lost because of
it."

Though the Garnet's playoff chances
had been dashed earlier in the weekend,
the team did not allow the fact to interfere
with the focus and determination going
into the game against the Blue Jays. If
anything, the losses provided the Garnet
with additional motivation to go out and
stir up the conference playoff landscape.
Lacy said, "Being eliminated from playoff contention was frustrating because
there are enough games that we could
have won that would have put us in the
playoffs. We chose to take that frustration
out on Johns Hopkins. Hopkins was still
in the hunt for the fifth playoff spot and
had everything to play for. With seemingly nothing to play for, we wanted to go out
there and play harder than the team that
had everything to play for. And we did. On
Saturday, if Haverford comes into our
gym, still alive for the playoffs, we will do
the same."
Though the team finishes the season
with a record better than the previous
year and with a particularly strong defensive showing in its final few games, nearly
all of the players continue to seek
improvement for the upcoming season.
"We have certainly improved on both
sides of the floor, but I don't consider this
season a success," Lacy said.
Gates, who has proven himself to be an
able scorer, rebounder, and contributor as
a first-year, said, "This year we've had
games where our defense has been phenomenal, like against Hopkins, but there
have been some let-downs throughout the
season. I hope that next year we'll be playing at the level that we've shown we can
play at
Our goal for next year is to be
competitive every game and hopefully
make a playoff run."
Yet for some of the players, the run
with the Swarthmore men's basketball
team will come to an end this weekend.
Allen, a senior who has played for
Swarthmore all four years, said, "It has
been a lot of fun for me to be able to compete on this level my four years here. I
obviously wish I could have won more
games in my career, but I have loved every
team that I have been on since I have been
here, and I can't wait to see the team
improve and grow together in the coming
years. Senior night will be emotional for
me because basketball has been such a big
part of my life, and I will definitely miss
playing for Swarthmore."

final home game of the season this
Saturday at home against Haverford at 4
