Taco Bell To Open
New Franchise In
Kohlberg Hall
By Joke Han
Instead of making a run to class,
students frequenting Kohlberg Hall
next year may be making a run for
the border.

This Wednesday, Ellen Wylie,
Director of Foundation and Corporate Relations, unveiled plans to construct a Taco Bell restaurant inside
the new building. According to

Speaker: Nuke Us, We're Ready!
By Derf Shrub
Swarthmore was treated Sunday
with an important message: the future of nuclear warfare.
Co-sponsored by the Political Science Department and SAFER, Lt.
Colonel Andrew Waite '64 delivered a highly-charged speech on
Swarthmore, nukes, and survival.
Waite, who has spent several years
as a Pentagon analystof Soviet weapons policy, began his remarks by
noting that "though the media may
try to convince you otherwise, the
risk of nuclear war is still stellar."
Citing the rise in popularity of
Zhirinovsky and recent tensions between the US and China, hedescribed
the US as "as near to MIRV massacres as we ever have been. We oughta
look overour shouldersand say,'Hey,
is that a firefly or NUCLEAR
DEATH?"'
Waite hastily assured a stunned
audience thatSwarthmorewas "probably safe" fromnuclear destruction.
"I've been working hard to defend
my alma mater, and we have a massive disinformation campaign among
the enemy. While we are a strategic
target, they think we're an all-girls
school in New York."
to a speaker

"If you do hear about the impend-

ing nuclear devastation," said Waite,

"the best thing to do is to hunker
down in one of those sub-free basements. Or hide in the library: you'll
probably be there already, and the
books will serve as shielding. Now,
that house of recycled straw was a
neat idea, but what we really need is
something thicker. Say, a house of
recycled auto batteries."
Waite then began to talk about his
years at Swarthmore, at times waxing nostalgic, "Ah, I remember when
Swat was so active... people battling
for their favorite cause.... I was one
of thefew 'Vietnam: Yes!'members.
The peaceniks outnumbered us
hawks, but that made it more of a
challenge! Great tactical training—l
remember whenthreeof us took down
a whole meeting house full of protesters."
Waite began to explain how Swat
prepared him for the military life.
"Well, it's tough as all hell, you stay
up late sweating a lot, the food is
similar, and the women wear crew
cuts!"
Throughout Waite's lecture, however, thecrowd had been getting restless. Even before the question-andanswer period, ominous chalk slo-

gans were appearing throughout campus. Ribbon-bearing members of the
Quaker meeting began to walk up and

down the aisles bearing signs like
"The Inner Light is not measured in
rads." Waite ignored them.
About five minutes later, four
masked SPAC members burst into
the auditorium waving pistols, shouting "down with the warmongering
government!" Waite shouted a few
commands, and SAFER members
armed with assault rifles, augmented
by Garnet Patrol irregulars, took up
positions. They were quickly jumped
by a partisan crowd of Ultimate
Frisbee longhairs, and thenDU joined
in on general principle. Tragically,
the Quaker Meeting protesters were
trampled in the chaos, which lasted
for several minutes.
Reactions to the lecture were
mixed. Said Ed Hilbert '95: "Well, it
was interesting how he focused on
the power dynamics of the whole
nuclear nation/non-nuclear nation dichotomy. He seemed to reify the inevitability of apocalypse. I wouldn't
want to live in his paradigm!"
Zed Evans '9B, however, seemed
to sum up the mood of the entire
audience, saying, "The refreshments
were nice."

Wylie, the costly construction will
be made possible by leftover funds
from the $1 million Joyce Mertz
Gilmore Foundation grant.
The Taco Bell area will occupy
most of the first floor in Kohlberg,
and will serve as a lounge for students and faculty. Administrators
hope that the added meal alternative
will ease some of the growing burden sufferedby theEssie Mae' s snack
bar in Tarble, which has faced growing crowds in the dinner hours.
Swarthmore's Taco Bell will operate much like Essie Mae's, allowing students to use meal credit to
purchase items such as bean burritos,
taco supremes and chillitos. Like
most resturaunts in the nationwide
chain, the Taco Bell will offer unlimited amounts of beverages to patrons, since its corporate owner, the
Pepsi Corporation, provides free
soda. Students with cars on campus
will also be able to take advantage of
the drive-thru service, one of the
costlier elements of the plan.
Blueprints for the Taco Bell replace the administration's plans to
build a cappucino bar. "We were
going to goahead with the cappucino
thing," commented Associate Vice
President Larry Schall, who has had
an integral role in the meal plan.
"But then we thought about it What
do students really want— glorified
coffee, or chicken soft tacos?"
Students generally responded to
the announcementwith enthusiasm.
"I'm so excited to be able to make a
run for theborder without having to
jog all the way down Baltimore
Pike," exclaimed Thomas Pinclean
'95.
The administration has not yet

McWawa. Similar praise abounded
for young Yelnik among Swarthmore
students: "He's a flirt," noted girlfriend Joan Hek '97, "but he's good
with his hands." "Basically, the guy
sleeps most of the day and then
watches old'Welcome Back, Kotter'
re-runs," contended friend Tim Stocke
'97. "I didn'tknow they gave scholarships for that sort of thing." In fact,
aside from an affinity for beer-pong
(which satisfies the Rhodes athletic
requirement), McWawa doesn't do
much at all. And indeed, McWawa
believed that it was precisely this
lack of actual accomplishments or
interests that won over the Rhodes
Committee.
"I just gave them a blank piece of
paper with the word 'resume' handwritten inbig letters at the top," stated
McWawa. "Not only were they impressed with my ingenuity, but they
liked the fact that I was so determined—l wasn't about to letalackof

inparticular McWawa was referring
to, he replied, "Well, there's no

But such dreams of the future can
be put aside for the moment;
McWawa is reveling in the here and
now. Surrounded by friends, a tipsy
McWawa declared: "I'm proofpositive that with hard-work and just the
right amount of bribery and alcohol,
anyone can succeed! Long live
America! Drinks are on me!"
And so this modem day Horatio
Alger and an entourage of well-wishers sped away in search of a non-dry
municipality, leaving behind aproud
Al Bloom. "Students like Yelnik winning the Rhodes can only reflect
well on the entire college," beamed
President Bloom. Rumors that the
American flag atop Parrish will be
replaced with a huge picture of
Yelnik are as of yet unconfirmed.

credit students will be able to use at
Taco Bell. Pointing to the low amount
ofcredit available to students at Essie
Mae's, perennial pessimist Yelnik
McWawa '95 expects meal credit to
be "abysmally low," Hannah Lemnolsci '97 is more upbeat. "At the
prices Taco Bell charges," she said,
"even a lousy $2.25 would go a long

way."

Administrators are equally excited.
"It's all part of the larger picture of
education," said Schall. "Our new
language lab will be in Kohlberg's
third floor. The majority of our foreign language students take Spanish.
Hopefully, the vocabulary-building
experience of ordering items like
nachos con que so and rancho burritos
will enrich the experience of students
coming out of an hour listening to
Spanish tapes. Am I genius or what?"
Taco Bell will also employ students to work behind the counter,
giving first preference to students on
financial aid and work-study. Joe
Khan '97 and Phil Spector '97, advocates of the plan, weaseled their way
to the top of the list. "After our article
in The Phoenix explaining how to
steal stuff from Tarble, we've been
bombarded with student requests to
show how to shoplift from other
places," said Spector. "After a few
weeks behind the counter, Joe and I
should learn enough to write a bangup article on robbing Taco Bell blind."
The addition of fast food to the
campus does not spell good news for
everyone, unfortunately. Alfredo
Renato, proprieter of a local pizza
establishment, is concerned that the
Taco Bell's delivery service will attract his regular customers. "What
will Ido now?" he said. "Before I
know it, I'll have to do something
drastic, like make the student special
a good deal."
According to Wylie, TacoBell was
not the administration's first choice.
"After seeing Pulp Fiction, I wanted
to build a Jack RabbitSlim's insideof
Kohlberg," she admitted. "But, when
we realized that no one at Swarthmore would pay $5 for a milkshake,
we decided to go with a, shall we say,
less expensive restaurant."

Hate Speech Table
Comes to Sharpies
In an effort to address concerns
of hate speech on campus, the Task
Force on Speech has resolved not to
ban the speech on campus, but to
sanction it and regulate it.
This Monday, joining the reserved rooms for Chinese, Spanish
and other foreign languages, the
"Hate Speech Room" will make its
debut in the Sharpies dining hall.
Diners in the room will be required
to speak at all times in a derogatory
tone, peppering their language with
offensive slurs and hurtful epithets.
Student response has varied. I
can't wait," saidHector Lipps, '97.
"I've been eating in the big room
for four years, and I'm just tired of
it. This is going to be a refreshing
change." Other students, like
Yelnick McWawa '95, are less optimistic. "I eat all my meals in
Tarble," he said. "What about students like me?"
The Hate Speech Room is the
first of several designated areas for
hate speech under considerations.
Pending approval, Housing Director Myrt Westphal plans to designate at least one hall in this year's
housing lottery as a "Hate Speech
Hall." Residents would sign the
housing contract with the understanding that they may resortto any
level of offensive and hateful
speech, provided that it is not used
during quiet hours.

Don't Turn Your
Clocks Forward
The College will not observe daylight savings time this year because
the practice is "relevant to everyday
life, has no theoretical basis, and
therefore is not appropriate in an
academic community," President Al
Bloom announced Thursday.
"Swarthmore seeks to promote
deep, serious, and critical examinationof the constructs which makeup
our world. It is ridiculous to force
people who are engaged in this important scholarly work to take time
to reset their clocks simply so that a
few factory workers can have more
time to enjoy the sunlight when they

leave work," explained Bloom.
Bloom reminded the community
that the outside world will still observe daylight savings time, and that
in the unlikely event someone
chooses to leave campus, he or she
should know that starting Sunday,
the time will be one hourlater everywhere else than it is here.

Student Council Candidate Seeks to
Implement "Contract With Swarthmore"
By T. Zorro
Joseph Goodman '97 has announced his candidacy for Student
Council office and promised that if
elected, he will enact a bold new
"Contract With Swarthmore" aimed
at reinventing Swarthmore government

Hoping to build a coalition oflikeminded officers, Goodman is running for every available seat on the
Council. While Goodman was refused SAC funding for what was to
be a celebratory extravaganza, he will
nonetheless officially sign the contract next Tuesday on the steps of
Parrish Hall. Guests are welcome to
attend, as long as they don't mind
offering fealty to the rising politician.
Goodman's campaign is just starting up. Of course, pursuading the
lacksadaisical Swarthmore student to
vote for his controversial plan is the
most pressing issue for the developing Goodman campaign. However,
he thinks he has the key to galvanizing the voters. "Money. Large

amounts of money. Basically, I'm
going to create jobs. The job is to
vote for me. I'll pay 10 dollars an

hour or a fraction thereof."
Once in office, Goodman plans to
offer a broad package of reforms to
Swarthmore College (see side bar).
And indeed, the man has a mission to
change this college for the better
he doesn't mess around with vacant
election campaign rhetoric like other
candidates. Rather, he's rallying
people to his side with a direct mes"I don't intend to do anysage
thing. I just want power".
When asked whether he hopes his
plan will restore the average
Swarthmore student's faith in government, Goodman retorted, "The
point isn't torestore faith in Student
Council.The point is to make a living
without doing much work."
The ability of an extremist like
Goodman to work with the more
moderate sitting government at
Swarthmore is crucial in this campaign. He will be forced to deal with
a president who doesn't support his
Contract. Yet Goodman believes he

is up to the task. "I will create a new
contract on that president. Let's just
say my Italian roommate will take
care of it."
But can he balance the budget???
That of course is the question resounding through thehalls ofParrish.
On this issue, Goodmanasserted, "I'll
be happy to balance anyone else's
budget and take any excess that exists as well!" Economics Professor
Art Hazara replied "Sounds good to
me! It's that kind of thinking that
earned him a C+ in my Intro to Econ
class. That kid deserves a Rhodes!"
However, theaverage voter is concerned about Goodman's ability to
live up to his campaign promises.
Stresses YelnikMcWawa '95, "Sure,
all that oppression stuffsounds good,
but how do I know he's going to be
able to deliver?"
When asked if he could guarantee
thathis plan wouldbe fulfilled in 100
days or less, Goodman replied, "No,
but I can guarantee that I'll be a rich
man in 100 days!" 'That's good
enough for me," replied a content
McWawa.

Lang Donates Giant Chair For Parrish Lawn
By David SoWhat
In yet another example of supreme
sacrifice, school spirit, and because
he likes having stuff named for him,
some guy named Eugene Lang has
donated another arm and a leg to
erect theEugene M. andTeresa Lang
GiantBeach Chair.
"Ihope theschool appreciates what
I'm doing for them." said Lang. "I'm
running out of internal organs."
President Al Bloom said, "We're
all very happy about Gene's donation. Besides, something had to be
done about the chairs." Bloom was,
of course, referring to the Parrish
beach chairs, whichrecently went on
strike. The beach chairs, along with
the chairs in Parrish Parlors, held a
sit-in outside the admissions office
two days ago.
"Basically this is all a matter of
compensation," amemberof thechair
community explained at the time.
"We're here today because we want
the administration to compensate for
all the hard work we do. For eight
months out of the year we're forced
into storage. We sit in a dark, dank
garage, lost and alone. We wantretribution. We're not leaving until we
get money from this institution. But
I'm sure we'll settle for academic
credit."
The sit-in was allegedly broken up
by a giant chain saw outside Parrish.
Although a Phoenix photographer
was able to capture the giant chain
saw on film, no one believed him and
he is currently seeking psychotherapy
as well as being wanted for grand
theft in the state of Alabama.

The chairs and SOFA (The Soci-

ety for Outstanding Furniture
Achievement) feel that Lang's con-

tribution was exactly what was required to defusethesituation. A member of SOFA said, "Boy, that was a

light bulbs—to keep the chair moving around Parrish Beach on massive
railroad tracks. This could light the
flag on top ofParrish for a while.But,
Lang protests that the giant chair was
not intended as a political statement.
SOFA members (not to be confused with SAFER members) are
worried about misrepresentation of
chairs among the rest of the furniture
community. However, the College
tried to assure them that the giant

chair would not have an American
Flag mounted at its top, nor would its
construction interfere with the passage of time. SAFER members had
no comment. They were too busy
shooting at the chain saw. Unfortunately, they kept missing.
Lang, who is currently in the hospital recovering from our having once
again sucked him dry as well as several gunshot wounds, was unavailable for comment

In the statement shereleased to the

railroaded the proposal through the
Committee on Academic Requirements on in order to "force-feed our

of the three areas, said Keith.

take a critical eye to the canon while
still giving students the background
necessary to move on to other areas
of study," said Bloom.
Students reacted vehemently to the
controversial new course. "I can't
believe they're going to make the

frosh read Milton, Locke and Darwin" saidBichN. Moen '95, "boy am
I glad I'm out ofhere. IfI wanted that
crap I wouldhave gone to U-Chicago

"It seems they've abandoned any
educational philosophy," said lan
Tellect '97.
"Who really cares what these guys
wrote. They're all dead and their
books are pretty irrelevant," said
Yelnik McWawa '95.
When asked about student reaction to the course, Bloom said "I
don'tcare what the students say, this
is the right thing to do."
None of the professors teaching
the course have been announced.
Bloom expressed hope that political
science professor James Kurth, biology professor Rachel Merz and English professor Abbe Blum would
run the course since they are some of
the more popular faculty in their departments and would make the required course easier to swallow.

Week Of Action To Support Citrus Fruit
It is high time that Swarthmore
comes to terms with a probiem of
severe discrimination, persecuting those who enjoy both Essie
Mae's and lemon in their tea.
Surprisingly, many students
were not aware there was a problem. But, in fact, abuse of lemons
far transcends a simple lack of this
acerbic fruit in a snack bar, believe
me. What do we call a broken
down car? A lemon. What do we
say about a scared person? We
say he turned "yellow." And when
was the last time you heard someone call someone else "you
lemon" as a compliment? A long
time, I'd venture.
So, when discrimination seeps
this deep into our college community, strong and quick action is
needed. Last September, a sub-

committee from a discussion
group of the campus issues'
project of the St. Patrick's Day
Parade of the defensive line of the
Project of the Administration on
Real ly Important Stuff (PARIS) created a taskforce to discuss the
issue.
Lastsemesterourgroupfocused
our energies on finding an acronym: Swarthmore United for Citrus Kare. This semester we have
set even higher goals forourselves:
a week of action.
Here*s our calendar for Citrus'
Rights Week, April 3-8, 1995:
ALL WEEK: Boycott and protest
of Essie Mae's, 12:30-12:59 p.m.
Scheduled chants include "No
Citrus, no peace," "Better Jello
than Yellow?" and "0,1, 2, 3, we
want lemon for our tea."

MONDAY: Chalkings and posters: "Proud to squeeze/lick/suck
lemons."
Also: Sign a petition in Parlors
in support of the "Citrus Responsibility Act," which requires all to
have a lemon handy, in fact, several lemons, to protect them from
intruders.* With the Conservative
Union and SAFER.
TUESDAY: Kirby. Free admission if you arrive before 7:59;
$2.75 after. Lecture: "Milk, Sugar,
and the Other: Lemons and Mo-

dernity." All panel participants
have pledged to use the phrase
"hierarchical sweetness-based hegemony" at least 16 times each.
WEDNESDAY: Sharpies small
room. Noon. Lemon-less tea drinkers support group meeting.
THURSDAY: Empathy Day. To

highlight the oppression faced by
modern lemons, several SUCK
members will strip naked, paint
themselves yellow, and demand
entry to Tarble. We'll see if they
let us in.
At night, to understand the lemons' plight, SUCK will sleep on
Parrish lawn naked in large vats of
lemon juice [Rugby players and
other multiple abrasion victims
are welcome to participate].
FRIDAY: List of demands to Al
Bloom, including the addition of
citrus-based attacks to a banned
words list in the speech code. The
word "sour" should be reserved
for lemons alone...
*Dutch Italian, a former Swarthmore student, is now running
away as fast as he can.

The most important lesson I have
learned in my last few months at
Swarthmore is thatthe students here
are wimps. It is down right impossible to stir up enthusiasm for armed
insurrection.
At the end of last year I decided
that I was frustrated with the way the
school was run, convinced that
gradual change was not happening.
The only solution I can see is arevolution. For months I have been dropping decreasingly subtle hints of my
intentions. I have tried to find students who secretly admire revolutionaries like Robespierre and
Trotsky. I have pointed out the efficiency of authoritarian rule, and the
rampant inefficiency ofSwarthmore.
People are very willing to gripe all

a committee! Yay!" So I decided to
actually create the instrument of the
revolution, the Garnet Patrol and see
whether people would get the message. Of course, I publicized for the
sake of the administration, that the
Garnet Patrol was simply a security
measure, and my all too gullible fellow students believed it! An organization to patrol campus?! Really, isn't
that obviously a cover for the army of
therevolution?
Lastly, I proposed that the Garnet
Patrol and Safer ought to work together (nudge nudge, wink wink, say
no more). SAFER wasn't interested,
neither were most of the Garnet Patrollers; don't they realize what they
were hired to do? So I have finally
up on any subtlety; I am com-

given

Prepare for the revolution!

They claim that they are doing everything they can to improve the situation but every privately run store in
America does better. I bet they, too,
would do better if they had guns to

Are you sick of being herded like

registration process? Are you tired of
being told that the committee is working on improving the situation? Watch
the Garnet Patrol burst into the committee, guns blazing and you'll see
how fast we have a computer registration system.
Are you fed up with unpopular
course offerings like, "Visible Symptoms," a study of sick and wounded
women in literature?I bet the English

Department could be convinced to
offer a survey course instead if we
threatened to dynamite their office.
Are you tired of Public Safety officers who protect the field house
from the athletes, the radio station

the students? Then arm yourselves!

Don't mess around with the deans (read "dons") here at Swarthmore, or you might find yourself wearing cement shoes and
taking "walks" with the fish In the Crum. Worse yet, you could end up sleeping in the foundation of the new Kohlberg Hall
like the unfortunate Murray Rabinowttz '95. Rabinowitz, an honors student In Biology and Classics, allegedly insulted one
of Harry Gotwals' daughters this past Sunday, and was found the next day dead In the foundation by stone mason Walter

During the numerous a cappella
performances last weekend, a new
Swarthmore groupreared its tuneful
head for the first time. On a beautiful Saturday afternoon, a small, fortunate audience in the Rose Garden
witnessed the premiere performance
of Sixteen Hairs, the youngest a cappella ensemble on the Swarthmore
scene. Formed just a month ago, the
group was born during an informal
sing along in Willets first southhallway. All four members realized that
they shared distinguished singing
backgrounds. Bass Dan "the Man"

pianist, actually sings in the shower.

It is inevitable. You can not
escape. No matter how intelligent
you are, no matter how high your
tolerance for alcohol, no matter how
large your penis, you are eventually
going to do something
really stupid, and you
are going to have to
face the ridicule of
your friends.
I speak to you with
the voice of experience. At this point you
are probably saying,
"You, Katie, you! You
have done something
really stupid and have
had to face theridicule
of your friends? I don't
believe it! How can
this be true?" Well,
believe me, mon ami,
it IS.
Now before I tell
you whit this really stupid thing was
thatI did, let me preface it with two
disclaimers. First, this happened
many months ago and I am still
being ridiculed about it That is how
stupid it is. Second, this unfortunate
"incident" occurred on what was
one of the worst days of my life. It
was one of those you get a bad grade

would have to put

back the soda and half
of the fry. So I opened
up my ID holder
which held my MAC
machine card and
pulled out a card. I
fed it to the machine.
And then I stopped
and pushed the cancel
button. Why, you
may ask, did I push
the cancel button?
Well, I don't know if
you noticed, but in
two previous sentences I mentioned
that I pulled out "a" card and fed "it"
to the MAC machine. I didn't pull
out "the" card. I pulled out "a" card.
I, in fact, had pulled out my
Swarthmore College ID card and
fed that to the MAC machine.
So, after pushing the cancel button, the screen on the MAC machine
flashed a message that said my card
was damaged and that I needed to
contact my bank to get a new one. I
don't remember the exact wording
but it was something like,

not to mention the fact that you are a
flaming idiot and do not deserve
your card back anyway. Your mother hates you. There is no God.
Thank you for banking with us."
After dropping to the floor in a
fetal position in front of the MAC
machine and crying for several
hours there, I obtained a new ID
card and sat down at a table in
Sharpies with my friends and proceeded to tell them of my MAC machine
massacre, fully expecting words of
sympathy and, maybe, a back rub.
Man, oh, man, was I disappointed. Not only did they laugh so hard
that they fell out of their chairs and
sat hyperventilating on the floor, but
they now continually bring up the
unfortunate episode in front of
friends, family, major heads of state,
and really good looking guys. Not to
mention the fact that I am always
loudly accused of being the person
who sabotages the MAC machine in
Parrish and causes it to make that
infernal beeping sound.
So in an effort to help you, my
beloved followers, cope with your
own personal hells, I offer to you
Katie Menzer's Righteous Guide to
Dealing with Ridicule:
1. Turn the other cheek. Yeah, its
Mom's advice and its the most adult
way of dealing with ridicule, but,

hey, you're not an adult. Follow it if

you want but...
2. Make a scene. Scream, rent
your garments, put soil upon your
head. Loudly decry the names of
your ridiculers in Sharpies while
sawing at your own wrists with a
knife. Hold your breath until you
turn bright purple and pass out. Put
your hands over your ears, yell that
you can't hear your tormentors, and
repeat the phrase, "Nan nanny boo
boo," over and over again. Heck,
after the ridicule you've endured for
the last couple of months, you have
no pride left anyway.
3. Cry piteously.
4. Become violent. If you're still
in Sharpies, go the the condiment
bar and use the ketchup, mustard,
and mayonnaise as war paint Then,
go collect all the hard, spherical
food items that you can find. Rice
croquettes, chicken croquettes,
falafel, Italian cheese balls, cupcakes, scoops of ice cream,
etc...Return to the dining room with
your ammunition and position yourself secretly behind your friends but
within reasonable firing distance.
Then let 'em loose. Now, be sure to
be behind your friends when you
commence your attack so that you'll
get a few more hits before they figure out what's going on. I know
attacking from behind is the coward's way, but remember, you have
no pride left.

one could download satellite pictures from space* simply
by thinking about it. Tbls would indeed be a major
improvement on the previous archaic technique of "day*
dreaming" still employed by most university students and

DMV employees.
But Is this technology good? Many people, and some
species of fern, have argued that modern technology has
done more harm then good. Ozone depletion, automobile
deaths, and smog are commonly cited as examples, particularly by the larger, more advanced, ferns. Certainly, technology possesses the power to do both harm and good.
Nuclear bombs, for example, can destroy entire cities. But
they also serve as effective paperweights. Microwaves can
heat up food quickly. But they also turn bread soggy.
There is no inherent "good" or "bad" in technology. The

moral decisions involved are not made by transistors or
motors or automobiles. That would be stupid. No, these
decisions are made by people. The responsibility lies in our
hands. The scientists of today and the scientists of tomorrow will never meet. Nevertheless, they are the ones who
will have to make the difficult decisions that could benefit
or harm humankind. The rest of us have the responsibility
of praying that they don't screw things up.

Two Win Truman Fellowships
For Public Policy Grad School
By Erik Huneke
RebeccahBennett '96 and Russell
Stark '95, both of whom are Lang
Scholars, are two of 85 college students nationwide to receive the
Truman Fellowship, an award of
$30,000 to beused for graduate study
in a field leading towards a career in
public service.
The Harry S. Truman Foundation
was founded by Congress as an independent organization to award grants
to juniors who demonstrate good academic standing, leadership qualities,
community involvement, interest in
pursuing graduate education, and, as
Bennett says, "dedication to a career
in public service."
The fellowship entails not only a
monetary grant, but also participation in the Truman Scholar Leadership Week at the end of May during
which all of the year's award recipients convene. Bennett looks forward
to using this time to meet "people
who want to spend theirlives helping
[other] people."
During the summer, Truman Fellows receive an internship in the government agency most relevant to the
area of public service which they
intend to pursue.
Bennett, who believes that she has
"always been destined for public ser-

vice," intends to focus on "poverty
policy and the empowerment of
people who have been socially and
economically disadvantaged."
She therefore plans on interning at
the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) "to see
what's realistic and what's not" in
moving from "saving the world to
working in a single community for
fifty hours a week."
Bennett said that in her opinion,
the Truman "values intellectual pur-

suits as well as interpersonal, community-building, and networking
skills."
Her involvement in addressing
these issues at Swarthmore thus far
has been concentrated on Adolescents Promoting Excellence (APEX),
an organization which she and Kesia
Constantine '96 co-founded.
This groupprovides academic enrichment, assistance in finding out
about and getting into colleges, cultural diversity activities, and social
events for a YWCA group of 14- to
21-year-olds in Chester.
"It's set up so the young people
empower themselves [because] they

own the program," Bennett said.
Bennett also plans to initiate a
magazine featuring the works of
young inner-city residents, who are

often portrayed in other media as
"criminal, promiscuous, and behav-

iorally deviant." She hopes that such
a publication would expose its readers to a more positive image of these
young adults which they have created for themselves.
As a senior, Stark would normally
no longer have been eligible for this
award. But since there has been a
shortage of award recipients from
Nevada, Stark's home state, the eligibility requirements now permit seniors from Nevada to apply.
During his time at Swarthmore,
Stark has "been doing various sorts
of community-action type work,"
beginning with his involvement in
MAGIC during his first year. During
the summer before his sophomore
year, he worked at MAGIC's sixweek camp which serves to extend
the "academic enrichment and fun"
which characterize the program during the academic year.
Stark has also been involved in
many of Earthlust's activities.

In January of Stark's sophomore
year, heheard about the formation of
a grassroots organization called
Chester Residents Concerned for
Quality Living, a group thatis fighting to controlpollution from themany
waste facilities in the area. Throughout the school year and last summer,
Stark helped by "canvassing neighborhoods and organizing petition
drives, events, and rallies."
Stark notes that "through the
group's efforts, the city of Chester
passed a change in its zoning code"
which forces new waste facilities
wanting to move into the area to
prove that they would not increase
existing pollution levels. A lawsuit
filed by the group one-and-a-half
years ago has led to the revocation of
a biomedical waste sterilization
plant's permit; the facility will shut
down by April 3 of this year.
Stark asserts that "working

in this

organization has been thebiggest influence in terms of thinking of my

future and career."
He intends to pursue graduate study
in urban and regional planning and
environmental policy. First, though,
he plans to acquire practical work
experience to find out what course of
study would help him most in achiev
ing his goals.

crime, and illiteracy persist in some
subgroups.... Social problems are
being recapitulated in each new generation. Children are being born into
families with no money, no jobs, no
cohesion, no love, no hope.... The
answer is not simply to reserve more
jobs for minority members. It goes
much deeper than that. The solution
is to stop the cycle of disadvantage in
the home."
She said at the meeting that she
had come tounderstand that her words
had upset many students. "I realize
that the editorial I wrote was very
offensive to many people. I regret
very deeply that that happened," she
said. "I wrote without theknowledge
of everything I was talking about,
and that was a mistake."
Several students asked Charry to
state what she now thought was wrong
with the ideas in her editorial. She did
not answer except to say that "I realized that I had done something that
could make every minority student
on this campus angry with me," and
that she felt she still had much to
learn about the issues involved.
This led Ayers to tell Charry, "What
I'm hearing is that the only reason
you changed your mindand retracted
whatyou wrote is that you are feeling
pressure from it. I don't think you
changed your mind." In response,
Charry reiterated her apology.
Charry also said her editorial might
have been misinterpreted; some students disagreed. "To me there's no
[room for] interpretation there," said
Ivan Perez '95. "It's a simple matter

of reading the statistics and showing
that they don't support what they're
supposed to support. You give no
statistics to show that children of
Native American or Black or any
other people are not loved. To me
that [idea] is very offensive, because
that is racism that people have taken
into them."
The only statistics Charry cited in
her editorial were imprisonment, poverty, and high-school dropout rates

in various racial and ethnic groups.

At an open forum

Wednesday night,
students aired their
grievances about
recent editorials on
affirmative action.
Shola Abidoye '97 said that while
Charry's editorialhad angered her, it
didhave one positive result. "I would
like to thank you for writing this
articlebecause it sparked discussion,"
she said to Charry.
An editorial about affirmative action that Charry wrote on March 2

may have inspired as much discussion as the more recent one. After
reading the first editorial, S ASS members posted a large sign in Parrish
inviting comments on Charry's piece.
The sign was quickly covered with
responses ranging from disgust to
agreement. Several students also
wrote letters to The Phoenix arguing
against Charry's article.
On Wednesday, Charry backed
away fromher originalposition, saying thatshe now believes the issue is
very complex, but that this should
notstopher from writing on the topic.
"I don't claim to know the answer,"
she said. "In wanting to spark discussion, I thinkthere's not necessarily a
need to know the answer."
Mohan Ambikaipaker '95 criticized this stance, arguing thatCharry
should have researched affirmative
action more thoroughly before writing about it. "You're a public person
because you 're the editorofThePhoenix, and this is an editorial in the
campus newspaper, and that brings a
certain professional responsibility."
Some students said the debate over
Charry's article was to be expected.
"Pretty much every year a racial issue will come up," Jim Foley '95 said
in an interview. 'These issues are
very difficult to resolve in a realworld setting. To come to resolution
at a campus where freedom of expression is a concern is even more
difficult."
A open discussion last night on
race relations at Swarthmore took
place too late to be covered in this
edition.

On Women, Men, and Science A Critique of Spike
Lee's Hypocrisy

As a senior about to embark on a graduate program in
biology, issues concerning women in science are of
special interest to me. So, when I saw a headline reading
"Women in Science and the Old Boys Club," with a
picture of a woman in goggles and a lab coat, in The New
York Times on March 29, it caught my eye.
The article was a televisionreview of a six part miniseries currently airing on PBS, which shows
successful women in science. The purpose
of the series, says the article, is, "if there is
a teen-ager around the house with a bent
toward science, this six-hour series offers
a set of role models."
I was pleased to see this article. It is

know that many women have known teachers who
discouraged them on the basis of gender, this, fortunately, has not been my experience.
It seems that becoming comfortable as a woman in
science occurs in two stages. First, a girl
or woman realizes that, despite stereotypes and negative influences, she and all
women have complete capability in science. This may be a difficult realization
to make, given the negativity she may
receive from societal influences. Shows
like the one in the NYT article help to

encouraging toknow that the networks are

supporting women in the sciences. This
article indicates a growing understanding
of theneed to work against the stereotypes
thatoften intimidate girls into thinking that
science is not for them. In a field that is
traditionally mainly composed of men, itis essential that
young girls realize that women have enormous talent
and ability in the sciences. The 1994 statistics of the US
Bureau ofCensus found that in the US workforce, only
30.1% of all employees in the natural sciences, 8.6% of
all engineers, and 32.4% of all mathematical and computer scientists are female. The fact that women still
compose a minority in the scientific community continues to discourage girls from entering it. Shows like this
mini-series are helpful in illustrating to girls that women
and men have completely equal capabilities in science.
With this in mind, I would like to point out that the

encourage this realization. The second
stage is to adopt a mode of thinking that

focuses on science rather than gender
distinctions. This enables women to see
women and men as truly equal, and feel
comfortable working with any person in the field.
For me, entering the field of science has involved
moving from an understanding of myself as a female
biology student, to myself as a biology student who is
female. This process enabled me first to approach the
subject without fear, and later to take advantage of all
opportunities, offered by both men and women. I
applaud PBS for airing this mini-series on women in
the sciences, and hope that it is the first step of a
successful career for many women.

Letters to the Editor
On Schwartz and

Capitalism
To the Editor:

I was upset when I read Brian
Schwartz’s letter to the editor in last
week’sPhoenix. I don’t think there’s
any chance of the United States moving to laissez-faire capitalism. The
state has long actively intervened in
the market, both to support the winners and to pacify the losers. It will
continue to do so; capitalism could
not survive without it. I also don’t
think many at Swarthmore believe in
the doctrines oflibertarianism.What
I am worried about, though, is that
many at Swarthmore do believe the
two basic claims which ground
Schwartz’s article. The first is that
it’s reactionary tr hold any value as
true, because values allow repression
of those who do not share them. The
second is that market economics is
natural and neutral.
The tolerance which Schwartz advocates, if I’m reading him right, is
nothing more interesting than relativism. I have no tolerance for relativism. I sympathize with those who
oppose values because they find the
values of this racist, classist, sexist,
and homophobic society abhorrent. I
agree; they are abhorrent. It is because I can’t tolerate them thatlcan’t
tolerate relativism. It contains no
possibility for an imperative for
change, no grounds for resistance.
Schwartz holds that libertarians, because most tolerant, are the most

"radical". It is incredible to me that
Schwartz thinks there is no choice
moreradical than tolerance.The force
of the Marxist tradition, for me, is
that iturges people to struggle against
domination. The value of liberation
allows a constant critical examina-

tion of the values which dictate our
modes of thought and relations of
production.
Schwartz argues for absolute tolerance within themarket system. Itis
interesting thathe chooses to exclude
the economic system from the realm
of values. Schwartz must accept economic law as a fact, not a value system, because an economic system
does not fit his model of tolerance. It
cannot possibly be an individual
choice. In order to have capitalism,
Schwartz's atomistic individuals
making their own personal choices
have to come to agreement on one
very important valuechoice: owners
of capital have the right to the profits
of production.
It is all the more interesting that
Schwartz accepts the market as value
free because it contradicts his own
stated values. "My body, mind included, produced my money.... What
ever happened to the Pro-Choice
'keep your laws off my body'"? Marx
could not agree more with Schwartz's
complaint. Yet the "laws" Marx
blames for removing from the workers the right to the product of their
labor are the laws of economics.
I am troubled by Schwartz's unquestioned acceptance of the laws of
economics, because I think they con-

Spike Lee consistently sets
himself up as the crucial filmmaker in terms of the representation of the black community, a term which imposes
an unquestionably violen'

completely undid his own justification for endorsing Nike products. He
could have said he was just a grubby
capitalist who was already stinking
rich but who wanted more money.
He did not do this. Instead, he chose
to cloud his dealings with Holly-

ceal a relation of domination. I am
even more concerned about
Schwartz’s endorsement of unquestioned acceptance as a radical perspective. Maybe it is dogmatic to
accept that freedom is important. Yet
this dogmatism allows a kind ofradical criticism that no skepticism would
tolerate. If socialism is a religion, as
Schwartz claims, it is more like liberation theology than the “secularized religious right.” Further,
Schwartz also accepts freedom without grounds. Unfortunately, the prerequisite of Schwartz’s freedom, a
system of atomistic individuals interacting in a free market, denies the
possibility of freedom.

labels. More importantly, that is not
what is at stake here. Spike Lee justified what he is doing in the culture

moting the company. This figure is
greater than Nike's entire 1992 payroll for these young workers in its six
factories, points out Miyoshi. Still,
Nike may move again. In communist
Vietnam, labor is even cheaper.
No longer is it of any importance if
Spike Lee wouldhave done the ad for
free or not. Either way, he is endorsing a kind of hostile and racist capitalism which erodes people's standard of living in this country.
This endorsement by Lee guarantees his own continued wealth butnot
that of anyone else. With so many
African-American men and women
out of work, it becomes truly baffling
\ that Mr. Lee is so, selfrighteously endorsing
this company. Nike could
easily afford to bring those

and Asian and Latino) folk

Ifcshoes anyway. They
could afford to do it
now, and they could
certainly afford it if Spike Lee refused to accept their money or endorse their products.
This, however, will not happen.
Spike Lee has proven himself a man
with an entrepreneurial creativity rivaled only by his skill in film-making. The- utter commodification of
the X symbol lent, as Paul Gilroy has
noted, a new stylish gloss (and a new
irony) to the Garveyism "race first
and self-reliance." These values pervade Spike Lee's work. There is a
sentimentalism at work for the brownstone, bourgeois, African-American
nuclear family, which I'm not sure
has ever been useful for describing
reality. This reification of a thoroughly white-washed model, one
which has been held up as a value but
then consistently denied to most Af-

rican-Americans, does not

serve to

represent the majority of people in
this country. Clearly, this "family"
never meant these things to many

African-Americans. Ithas always signified something much more interesting and radical. Lee, black populist entrepreneur, then is clearly imposing a definitionof the family identical with that of the opponents of
affirmative action; both serve to justify and perpetuate a model of social
relationships which has at its base
economic and racial domination.

not

The recent Collection re-opened
the issues of speech codes and tolerance at Swarthmore. Keelyn
Bradley's article in these pages last
week appeared to support such a
code in an effort to promote tolerance.

Speech tends to be a subjective activity,
based heavily on intent
Said
the right way, "I hate you"
immeasurably. So could, "You
ugly"
"What you just wrote
stupid."
I would like to explain why a
speech code is a bad idea andfails to
solve the underlying problems of

"offender."
Just wait until a group of people
must reconstruct a verbal exchange

which hate speech is merely a symp-

in an attempt to figure out if "enough"

For aside from being both impossible to put in place and impossible to enforce, a speech code does
not solve the problem Mr. Bradley
shows to exist at Swarthmore.
When the issue of speech codes
was discussed on Newswatcher last
year, I asked a question which only
one person attempted to answer:
whichofthe following is hate speech,
how is it different from the others,
and how should the offenderbe prosecuted?
1)1 hate you.
2) I don't like you.
3) I don't like you, because you
are Jewish.
4) I hate you, Jew.
I am willing to guess that # 1 & #2 are
definitely not hate speech, even
though someone could make me feel
very uncomfortable by saying either
of those things to me. In fact, I could
feel extremely violated by either of
#1 or #2, but they are certainly statements which I will have to learn to
cope with.
Now #3 is a more interesting one,
since it could be said calmly or with
greatvolume and animosity. Ifsomeone said #3 to me, I wouldprobably
feel upset. But what if they explained
to me why they did not like Jews?

In thereal world, people say things
that wound others. Should we attempt to dissuade such speech? Sure.
The College easily could place a statement in the Handbook discouraging

tom.

What if they legitimately do not
likeJewish people?Should they have
the right to say so? I would say yes.
If they are thinking it, I would prefer
that it get discussed. Either way, I do
not think we can punish that person
for disliking Jews. So if they calmly
say #3 to me, I do not think it should
be an actionable offense.
This brings me to #4.1 assume this
is hate speech in many people's
minds. I personally think this could
be the same as #3. Yet again the
intent of the.speaker is of paramount
importance. In my mind the issue,
however, is not about #4.
Let's assume that #4 is hate speech.
Let's further assume that we can
come up with about fifty phrases
which ought to be outlawed and we
all agree about their ugliness. That
does not solve the problem of #3.
Speech tends to be a subjective
activity, based heavily on intent and
context Said the right way, "I hate
you" could wound immeasurably.
So could, "You are ugly" or "What
you just wrote was so stupid."
People who want speech codes
seek comfort. I can respect that. In
fact, having had a few slurs tossed
my way, I can even empathize with
aspects of feeling victimized based
on racial/religious grounds. But at

could do it. If you think that would
change a single thing on campus, I
think you are mistaken. Would it
make some people feel better? When
we all have to face how close #4 is to
#3 is to #2 is to #l,l doubt anyone
would feel much safer.
Speech is ultimately about the
speaker's intent, and we can never be
safe as long as people have evil intentions.

Answering Questions No One Asked
Clear and Present Danger answers the question no one was asking:
what if somebody made a two-and-a-halfhour JamesBond film with no
suspense and no sense of humor? Danger is a monotonous,
uninflected progression of short scenes, each of which feel*
as if it's been cut to about one-tenth its original length. The
novel from which the movie is adapted was written by the
ever-turgid Tom Clancy, so this ought to be a blessing, bv
instead it robs the scenes of whatever significance they
might once have had. Danger is so busy jumping from
intrigue to intrigue the characters never have room to devel
op—which means we have no reason to care about what
happens to any of them. Harrison Ford's dully virtuous Jack
Ryan is the worst of the lot, but that's only because we
have to watch him longer than anyone else. Far from I
excellent work in The Fugitive a few years ago, Ford
walks through the movie as if he were afraid to break
things. That isn't restraint; it's unconsciousness.
The film as a whole takes the same murderously
measured approach. The "moral crisis" of Clear and
Present Danger centers on the President's decision to
send covert military squads into Colombia to assassinate drug lords, but it only gathers force in the last
half-hour, when the government's need for secrecy leaves "our boys"
stranded in the Colombian jungle with no way out. Ryan attempts one
of those "daring last-minute rescue" things, but by then it's far too late
for anything to pique our interest. Too much time has been squandered
on affectless, posturing stateroom scenes, intercut with shots of the soldiers blowing things up in a vain attempt to keep things moving. Unlike
a Bond film, Clear and Present Danger refuses to give us villains we

could hate, or a hero we could like—it's too busy being "good." The
stately, lifeless direction and flat cinematography seem to tell us this
film is too important to be mere entertainment—it wants to be more.
, it's just less, less, less.

strategy is, in a word, more. The idea is not to come up with
new jokes, just to do the old ones more blatantly.
A fine cast including Gene Wilder, Mart Kauffman,
Teri Garr, Madeline Kahn, and an unrecognizable Gene
Hackman is wasted in the process. Wilder and
Kauffman are the most successful; their frenzied mugging almost adds up to something. But the center of this
film is a big fat nothing. It apes the original Frankenstein

nothing else to the joke.
When Madeleine Kahn turns up in an Elsa Lancaster wig, it's supposed to be a hoot—never mind that there's no conceivable reason for
her doing so, or that no one ever remarks on it. Mel Brooks has never
understood the process of shaping jokes. He seems to think justputting
things in front of the camera is funny.

Tricky's Maxinquaye: Subtly Moody
By Krister Olsson
Massive Attack alumnus Tricky has recently released his first long player to much
acclaim in Europe, and wonder of wonders,

the album is due to reach these shores on April
18th. Maxinquaye (on Island Records in
Europe and to be released on Polygram in the
US) is a trip hop album worthy of one who has

pers in the relatively young "industry," but at
the same time it finds itself moving beyond the
bounds of the genre and into the realms of
straightforward rap, enigmatic ambient, and
lethargic dub. Blending eerie samples,
Tricky's nasal voice, and the unnerving
singing of Tricky's partner in crime Martina
(whom he picked up outside a girl's school
some years ago), Tricky successfully creates a
dark, moody world similar but at the same
time more varied than those created by
Portishead and Massive Attack (the other
two members of the so-called Bristol

nexus).

The album includes the single
"Ponderosa," which has been availA able in the US since mid-1994 on the
B "4th and Broadway" label, but the
H real winner is the single "Aftermath"
(which has also been available in the
US). The track makes use of the
V Blade Runner sample "let me tell you
V about my mother" (from the beginV ning of the movie) to evoke a feeling
V of paranoia which successfully lasts
Wm
the entire track. Tricky also successfulW ly deconstructs Marvin Gaye albums,
f and adds to his bizarre collage a bit of
Michael Jackson on the track "Brand New,
Your Retro."
The album's title comes from a slight reorganization of the letters in his deceased moth-

Tricky puckers up for the camera...

Week in Review

Men's Rugby
The Evil Buzzards were in truly
25
as they crushed the rugby team from
St. Joseph's University. They played
at home on DuPont field on a sunny
afternoon and nearly shutout a rough,
tough, and slightly vicious St. Joe's
squad (whose physiques suggested
that one too many beers had been
consumed over the course of the season). The A side won by a score of
27-5, but the B side, unfortunately,
did not fare as well.
The tries were scored by Jason
Dougal '96, Chaz Teplin '96, and
Mark Pletcher '96 who scored twice.
Dougal made his exciting try look
totally effortless and Teplin had the
distinction of kicking his own conversion. Pletcher was graceful as always and ever so impressive. The
team played well in general, and creditedmany good plays to theback line.
All in all, Swat's favoritemaleruggers
put on a strong performance for their
fans. Look for them "dashing" by
you today, and show them your appreciation with your dollars!

Swarthmore Women's Rugby had
a tough weekend when they arrived

faced three tough losses. Although
Princeton is a strong, well coached
team, Swat was able tokeep up their

intensity throughout the day despite
the losses.
Swarthmore regrouped this week
with strengthening practices to prepare for a tournament at the Univer-

Men's Lacrosse

The women's tennis team opened
their regular season last Thursday
against Franklin and Marshall and
thentraveled to Bryn Mawr on Saturday and Gettsysburg on Wednesday.
The women played well in all three
matches, to bring theirrecord to 3-0.
AgainstF & M, Swat won all three
doubles matches and headed into the
singles play needing only two victories to clinch the match. The #1
doubles team of Becca Kolasky '96
and Ayanda Nteta '95 prevailed in
their pro-set 8-2 and finished the
match with a smashing overhead,
punctuating their solid win. The #2
doubles team of Kim Crusey '95 and
Becky Katz '95 won with a score of
8-3. Winning at#3 doubles(8-5) was
the team of Hilary Gehlbach '96 and
Rani Shankar '9B.
In singles, the team not only got
the two victories needed to clinch the
overall win, but swept all six matches.
Becca Kolasky '96 won convincingly
at #2 singles 6-0, 6-0. Becky Katz
'95 also prevailed without dropping
a single game at #4 singles. Playing
#3 and #6 singles respectively were
Ayanda Nteta '95 and Hilary
Gehlbach '96, who both won with
solid strokes. Kim Crusey '95 and
Michelle Martinez '97 both fought
hard in three sets to defeat tough
opponents. Crusey prevailed over
Franklin & Marshall's #1 player 6-7,
6-0, 6-3. Martinez remained on the
court, defying darkness, and refused
to give in even though the overall
match had been decided in Swat's

In the season opener last Monday,
Swat softball started off with a big
win against Neumann College in a
non-conferenceface-off. Swatstarted
with a quick lead but the Knights
rallied back for a five run lead. The
Garnet pulled things off in the last
inning with big bats and tight defense
to hold them, 20-19. Frosh players
had exceptional performances; Dana
Lehman '9B led the team offensively
with four hits and a .800 average
while Michelle Walsh '9B batted an
impressive game with three hits and
seven RBIs. Pitchers RachelBrakke

The men's lacrosse team had high
hopes entering Saturday's game
against Tufts University. They were
riding the wave of a big winlast week
against Cabrini. Through the first
three and a half quarters the score
stood at a 7-5 deficit However, the
Garnet fell victim to lack of depth
and dropped a 13-6 decision.
After wearing out the defense by
controlling the ball all game, Tufts
was able to break the backs of the
defenders by scoring six big goals in
the waning minutes. Until then, the
defense had been playing superbly,
led by Andy Petusky '95 and goalie
Ben Henwood '97. Pressed in their
own end all game, the defense had
kept the team in the game by coming
up big when they had to. However,
with starter Shannon Brown '95
knocked out of the season last week,
the defense was just worn out.
Offensively, the Garnet once again
found a productive game from the
attackmen. Cary Schaub '95, Brian
Dougherty '95, Erik Griffin '96, and
Kevin Aldrick '95 continued their
success of putting some points on the
board. The midfield, playing tough
throughout the contest, fell victim to
depth problems like the defense.
While the playing level was equal
to that of Tufts, the opponents had
twice as many midfielders to throw
into the game. With the currentrecord
at 1-4, the team must win at Drew
Saturday night to gain respect before
heading into the tough conference
games. After Drew, the team will

sweep, prevailing 6-3, 5-7, 6-0.

Swat met Bryn Mawr on Saturday
afternoon and again proved the team's
strength. Doubles teams of Crusey
and Katz, as well as Kolasky and
Becky Riskey '9Bboth won 8-1. The
#3 doubles team of Martinez and
Gehlbach fell to their opponent in a
very tough match, losing in a tiebreaker 8-9 (9-7).
The singles matches were again
swept by Swat, repeating the feat of
Thursday. Crusey won at #1 singles,

dropping only two games. Kolasky
and Katz won at #2 and #3 respectively with identical scores of 6-0, 60. Gehlbach at #5 won 6-4, 6-2 and
Riskey posted herfirst varsity win of
the regular season in singles, with a
solid6-0,6-0 victory. Martinez again
fought hard in three sets, almost mirroring her score from earlier in the
week; she prevailed 4-6, 7-5, 6-0.
The team has opened the season with
two strong victories and hopes to
continue its success in its upcoming
matches against Gettysburg and
Dickinson.
The women's tennis team earned
their third victory of the spring season against Gettysburg on Wednesday. Remaining undefeated was the
#1 doublesteam of Kolasky and Nteta.
They won their pro-set 8-2. Losing a
very close match was the #2 team of
Crusey and Katz A pro-set can be
very tough to play considering that
there is no second set and fewer
games. Under new rules, the doubles
teams play before singles, which has
presented a new challenge for the
women. Fighting hard for the win at
#3 doubles was the team of Gehlbach
and Shankar (9-7). Their win enabled Swat to enter singles play with
a 2-1 lead. The top three singles
players won convincing matches:
Crusey 6-2, 6-0; Kolasky 6-1, 6-2;
Nteta 6-3, 6-1. Also winning for
Swarthmore was Martinez at #5
singles, 6-4, 6-2. She turned in an
excellent performance, along with
the rest of the team, helping S wat win
the overall match 6-3.

Ultimate Frisbee
The Swarming Earthworms have
been hard at play, practicing the defensive strategies of captains Robin
Mandel '97 and Matt Robison '96 in
order to prepare for the "Pig Out-Lay
Out" Tournament this weekend at
Haverford, which will include competition from 20 college teams. With
the arrival of their new frisbee design
(a mere $7!), the team is spirited for
competition. The discs fly over Mertz
lawn every day, as dedicated players
prepare their tosses for use in the
upcoming Alumni Game and the
B ucknell Tournamentnext weekend.
A few of theEarthworms attended
a "hat tournament" last weekend. In
this format, players are chosen at
random (out of a hat, as it were) to
joinhomogeneous teams. "It was alot
of fun," co-captain Matt Robison reflects, "I got to team up with people
I would normally be marking. I
learned a new throw, too." Hopefully, Robison will be able to use
such experience to augment his already strong offensive strategy, which
the 'Worms have been studying and
drilling all month.
The Earthworms continue towards
their goal to win Sectionals, and this
weekend's competition should serve
to place Swarthmore high in the
rankings. Swarthmore has come
within one catch of beating Haverford
before, and they will not miss this
opportunity to redeem themselves.

Around this time of year March
Madness sets in and the greatest concern most Swatties have about this
glorious state is how "the Whos" are
doing in their respective NCAA poles.
For the members of Swarthmore's
men's and women's track teams however, the story is quite different.This
past weekend the fabled "warriors of
the Skallerup" (that's the track team)
traveled to Fredericksburg, Virginia
torepresent S warthmoreat the fourth
annual Mary Washington Invitational.
The Invitational is a meet structured around relays; however,
Swarthmore did field numerous athletes in various individual events.
For the women's team, Shoshanna
Pearlman '9B, after injesting enough
coffee to kill a small quadruped, finished with a strong third place in the
grueling women's 3000m. Pearlman
wasn't the only Swarthmore distance
woman who exhibited gritty determination and drive. Danielle Wall
'9B, ran a personal best time in the
womens' 1500 and was edged out
of third place by one tenth of a second. For the men, the most impressive individual performance was
turned in by one of Swarthmore's
massive male throwers, Eric Walton
'97. Walton won the javelin throw
with a mighty hurl of 166' 10".
Reaping the rewards of five
months' hard work, the various relays showcased their individual talents this weekend. By leaving for the
meet early, the men's 4 x 800 relay
of JohnFreeman '96, Steve Laubach
'96, Kerry Boeye '97 and Wyn
Strodtbeck '9B showed the determination and loyalty that has become a
trademark of the track program. Af-

m

m

ter turning in numerous personal
bests, the relay came away with a
respectable fifth place finish. The
men' s distance medley relay also produced a number of strong perfor-

mances. Among those was Laubach's
blazing 2:02.0 second 800 leg that
was nothing shortof spectacular. The
men's sprint relays functioned like a
well oiled machine and demonstrated
unprecedented mechanical excellency in the relay passes. The most
notable performances in the men's
4 x 100 ,4 x 200, and 4 x 400 meter
relays were turned in by Chris
Hourigan '96, who has come back
from a slow start to regain his speed
and form. Newcomer Frank Amar
'96 also turned in strong splits in all
of the men's relays.
The women'srelays this past week-

m

end can be described by one word:

DOMINATION. First the women's
4 x 100 meter relay consisting of
Danielle Duffy '9B, Tori Washington '97, CatherineLaine '9B and Jill
Wildonger '97 took the track and
proceeded to break the school record
in the event by a whole second with
seemingly little effort. This incredible effort merited them a second
place finish behind Christopher Newport University who turned in an
NCAA national qualifying mark. The
4 x 200 saw much of the same as
again Swarthmore's women sprinters tore around the track at frightening speed this time shattering the old
school record by an incredible 10
seconds (no, thatis not a typographical error). The results again merited
thema second place behind theChristopherNewport women's team. The
4 x 400 saw a different result. This
time the women fielded a team consisting of Duffy, Laine and
Wildonger, this time with the addition ofthe cagey veteran and captain,
Kate Dempsey '95. This time the
women left no doubt of their dominance by defeating all other competitors by 25 meters. The collective performances ofthe three women's sprint
relays, earned the admiration and respect of every athlete at the meet.

By Matthew Halpern
Having started their season with
an extremely impressive win
against the Collegeof Notre Dame
ofMaryland, the women's lacrosse
team has continued to look strong,
knocking off their next two opponents and then losing in a heartbreaking upset to Gettysburg College in double overtime.
The Garnetstarted theweek with
a remarkable 22-2 victory over

demonstrating the might of their

Noyes '95 tallied nine goals and an

three goals and four assists. Kristen
Osborne '97 added three goals and an
assist, and Chu'ya Hornberger '97
contributed three goals. Erin Flather
'97 and Laura Starita '96 each had a
goal and an assist, and Madeline
Frasier '95 and Jessie Orlowski '9B
each scored a goal.
On the game, head coach Karen

Borbeenoted, "Theother team wasn't
very strong. It was a rebuilding year
and we were able to take advantage
of their youth. It was a great chance
to play a lot of people."
The team thendefeated Lynchburg
College in a thrilling battle last Sunday by a score of 10-7. Lynchburg
was a highly touted opponent (ranked
12 in a recent preseason college poll
in which Swarthmore was ranked 10),
and the Garnet's flat performance at
the start of the game, led to a 3-2
lead
halftime.
Lynchburg
Swarthmore took advantage of the
break in the action to regroup,and the
team came out much stronger in the
second half, scoring four unanswered
goals. From there the Garnet continued to build on their lead untillate in
the second half, when Lynchburg
scored three quick goals to make it a
close game again. Despite this lastminute surge, however, Swarthmore
did not falter, scoring a final putaway goal to sure up the victory.
The team received offensive contributions from a variety of their talented players. Noyes continued her
scoring tear, leading the team with
four goals and one assist that day.
Ewens had an outstanding game as
well, netting four goals and an assist.
Osborne scored one goal and two
assists, while Flather contributed
one goal as well. Defensively, the
team was led by the play of co-captain Heather Maloney '95, Bess
O'Neil '95, and goalie Jill Maybee

'96. Borbee commented, "They were
a talented team and it was a good win
for us."
On Tuesday, the team suffered its
first loss of the season to Gettysburg
by a score of 13-12. At the end of
regulation play the score was tied 11
11. Although the Garnet managed to
score first in overtime, Gettysburg
was able to tie up the game before
time expired and score first in the
sudden death overtime that followed,
coming away with the win. Scoring
for the Garnetwere Ewens with three
goals and one assist, Osborne with
one goal and one assist, Noyes with
seven goals and one assist, and
-

Maloney with one goal.

Unfortunately, it looks as if the
have to play theremainder
of their season withoutLia Ernst '97,
a talented scorer for the Garnet who
has been sidelined by an ACL tear.
Borbee commented, "She'll still be
with us at the games, but Lia's absence on the field will be a devastating loss for the team. She is a physical presence as well as strong personality, and we'll just have to rise to the
occasion."
At this point in the season, Borbee
saidofherteam,"Sofarsogood. I'm
really pleased with our record, but
our schedule is such that we have a
tough game every time we turn
around." The Garnet look to continue their strong play in an away
game against Drew University this
Saturday.

Tennis Awaits Amherst, Williams After Atlanta Trip
By Jeremy Shweder

Think big. Think Mount Everest,
the Sears Tower, Senior Comps. All
of these things may seem big, but
none are as important as tomorrow's

The Garnet began their season
looking to return to the year-ending
twelve team national tourney, which
they missedfor thefirst time ever last

Garnet must either earn one of two

automatic bids from the East region
or garner one offour national "wild-

Patrick Straub '97
The resurgent Garnet baseball
squad surpassed last year's win total

of this week with their fifthand sixth
victories, due in large part to the
contributionsof pitcher/centerfielder
Patrick Straub '97. At the plate,
Patrick was 6-15 with 5 runs scored,
4 RBI, and 4 stolen bases. Patrick
also was on the hill for both victories,
an exciting 7-6 come from behind
victory over Wesley (DE) and a 21 -8

thumping of Philadelphia Pharmacy
on Tuesday. The victory raised his
record to 4-2 on the season.
"Patrick has added some much
needed pop to our lineup, which had
some problems producing runs at the
end of last year," according to cocaptain and fellow mound mate
Chuck Hudson '96. "He's beginning
to solidify his status as a top pitcher
in our league as well."

Julie Noyes '95

Hopper

Julie is one of the most dominant
athletes on campus. She plays third
home on the attack line for the
women's lacrosse team. She was an
All-American after her monster season which saw her break the NCAA
Scoring Record of 107 goals in one
season. The record, which was held
by Swat's coach Karen Borbee when
she played for Delaware, was for all
NCAA divisions not just Division
UJ. With 199 goals, Noyes broke
the Swarthmore career record for
goals scored after only two seasons
with the Garnet after transferring
from national Division I power
Princeton and recovering from re-

constructive knee surgery.

She is
currently averaging 7 goals and 1.5
assists per game for the team which
was ranked 10th in the country in the
preseason NCAA poll.
Teammates refer to their captain
as a good motivator and a great team
player. Kristen Osborne '97 said
"On the field Julie isn't just interested in herself although you wouldn't
know it from her stats." Osborne,
who had the misfortune of playing
against Noyes in high school, added
"During a game you are really glad
that Julie is on your team and not the
other." Noyes also played for the
field hockey team in the fall.

fight. Facing Trinity of Texas, the
tennismen won the preliminary
doublespoint behind the inspiredplay
of Chris Ciunci '95 and Eddy Ernst
'9B at number three doubles and the
pro-level tennis of Chris Pearson '95
and Barry Mook '96 at number one
doubles. Entering singles, the Garnet needed only to win three of six
matches to clinch the win. The match
looked to be in hand when George
Khalaf '96 quickly dispensed his
number six singles opponent in two
straight sets and both Pearson and
Mook won their first sets. The win
proved elusive though, as Trinity
battled back and won the match 5-2.
The matches this weekend showcase what most experts call the top
three teams in the East region, but it
is likely that only two teams will
qualify for the national tournament.
A clean sweep of Williams and
Amherst would give the Garnet the
top spot in the East, though a split of
the two matches would stillkeep them

in the running for an automatic bid.
"We expect these two matches to
be very tough," commented number

one singles player Pearson as he
blasted one-hundred mile-an-hour
serves at a standing mannequin with
the word "Williams" written in Garnet ink across its brow. "Williams
may be a little stronger than Amherst
this year, but we really need to beat
them both. This is our home court
and we don't want anybody coming
in here and competing with us."
The Williams and Amherst
matches, though incredibly important, are only the beginning of a stretch
of high pressure Division HI matches
against East region opponents, including MIT, Rochester, Haverford,
and Skidmore. "It's important that
we win these matches not only for the
automatic bid, but also to build some
momentum," revealed Hunter
Gehlbach '95. "Ifwe can get on a roll
we may just run wild over theseEast
region opponents."
The Garnet's season thus far has
been marked by inconsistency. There
have been some great individual performances, but no player has been
able to build a winning streak over
severalmatches. "It's about time for
all of us to pick up the slack," explained Ciunci. "It wouldbe nice to
have someone to rally around, but
that'snot the nature of tennis. We all
have to win our individual matches
for the team to succeed. I expect that
this weekend is going to be a battle of
epic proportions, butl think that when
the dust clears we 'll be standing high."

March Madness! Swat Huge Underdog to
Arkansas in NCAA Championship Game
By Madman Lischer

Although Swarthmore enters
Saturday's Final Four matchup
against defending national champions Arkansas a heavy underdog, the
story of the Garnet's Cinderella season will not soon be forgotten.
Along its path to Seattle,
Swarthmore has left behind a trail of
bewilderedteams. Kentucky, Tulane,
Arizona State, and North Carolina
have filed a joint formal protest with
the NCAA over Proposition 747, by

which Swarthmore earned its tournament bid.The proposition, granting a
tournamentbid to theCentennial Conference champion, is the first of a
series of expected revisions to the
tournament selection process. The

The protest claims that
Swarthmore's admissions policies
discriminate against basketball players who are academically disinclined.
The third paragraph of the protest

summarizes the complaint:
Swarthmore College operates an
admissions policy whose fundamentalprinciple is in blatant opposition
to NCAA regulations by nearly doubling the minimum required SAT
score on average. The Swarthmore
admissions committee fails to select
a student body on an academic-blind
basis. As a result, thebasketball program is able to draw from a pool of
student-athletesof above-average intelligence. We argue Swarthmore

Bye Bye Lil' Quakers, Hello Potato Bar
By Adam Fromduke
In an unprecedented move to
change Swarthmore's image, the
Collegehas announced a recent decision to replace the current mascot.
Depending on whom you ask, the
current mascot is either Garnet or
Li'l Quakers. As of next academic
year, Potato Bar will be the formal
mascot.

Problems with the current mascots
have not been hard to come by. No
one is able to dress up as Garnet for
any major event, and several fights
have broken out over the question of
whether Garnet is precious, semiprecious, or down-right abundant.
As to the Li'l Quakers, yet again
few were able to don appropriate
attire to fill the role. Several Larger
Quakers have been spotted at sporting events, but finding both a Li'l
person and a Quaker outfit can be a
daunting task.
Further, after therecent riot during
the women's rugby match when several Quakers on campus became ornery after drinking too much, Borough Police expressed regret at not
being able to fire into the mob. Said
one officer, "It was too hard to distinguish between real Quakers and Li'l
Quakers." As it happened, only three
of the forty-odd Quakers were registered Li' 1 Quakers while therest were
rabble rousers who will likely befacing some serious jail time.
Problems in the past aside, the

College's press release announcing
the increased importance of Potato
Bar chose to highlight the positive:
"Potatoes are healthy, and we believe
students will have no problem dress-

ing up as them." According to Associate Vice-President Larry Schall,
Dining Services will likely make
Baco Bits available to all students
before home basketball games and
swim meets to help with outfitting.
The College Athletic Department
has not skipped a beat in this whole
process, marketing a new line of tshirts with such catchy slogans as
"Swat Spuds," "Idaho Bom and
Bred," and "I ain't no Yam." They
are not really sure what the market
will be for such merchandise, but
sales can only bebetter than those for
the ill-fated previous t-shirt design
showing prison labor attempting to
mine for blocks of garnet.
Haverford's public relations office was caught off-guard by the
move, and has dealt with the confusion with a series of closed-door
meetings. Inside information has led
TheKleenexXo believe that Haverford
is contemplating changing their mascot to Quiche Bar, but they clearly
feel outwitted by Swat's power play.
Said Swarthmore Vice President
for External Affairs, Harry Gotwals:
"Quiche is not even a meal."Linda
McDougal, head ofSwarthmore Dining Services refused to comment on
the allegation but provided this reporter with a heaping bowl of beef

yat which certainly calmed my edgy

nerves.

Perhaps most important, however,
is how therecent change might affect
enrollment at the College. Prospective students seemed confused by all
the commotion, but nearly 3-1 preferred theidea ofPotato Bar to thatof
Quiche Bar. Said one who spoke on
condition of anonymity, "Actually,
neither is a meal.But at least you can
claim that Potato Bar is a meal. I
mean who eats only quiche?"
After a follow-up question focussed the issue a little more closely
on the idea of mascots, that same
student continued, "I like the idea of
Potato Bar. I mean as long as no one
wants to eat it, why not wear it?"
Carl Wartenburg, Director of Admission, expressed only limited concerns about the change, mostly directed at how the shift in mascots was
handled. Said Wartenburg, "I per-

sonally think Potato Bar is a fine
choice. Few other ideas encompass
Swarthmore so well. I only wish this
had not happened during accepted
student weekend."
All things considered, the greater
community of Swarthmore appears
happy to see Garnetand theLi'l Quakers go. Uncertainty over the exact
future of Potato Bar are definitely a
cause for concern, but as Al Bloom
said, "We must embrace uncertainty,
not be afraid of it. Potato Bar can be
a wonderful mascot, even if it is not
actually a meal."

Daulerio showcased his new talents

While the Razorbacks have more
talent and size than the Garnet,
Swarthmore does have one advantage, on-courtsmarts. No Swarthmore
player has ever called a timeout in the
final seconds of a down-to-the-wire
game without having a timeout to
call therebyreceiving a technicalfoul
and loss of possession of the ball.
This poise helped defeat NorthCarolinalastSaturday as RasheedWallace

When asked about the team' s pros

tomorrow's game, co-captain Craig
Rodner'96 said, "I have full confidence we're going to win. We just
need to play tough defense. Besides
if I remember correctly from biology, a razorback is just a lean, wild
hog. We're going to take that wildness right out of them. I bet they
make bad bacon, but we're going to
smoke them anyway."
Key head-to-head matchups will
be the Garnet's tough defensive

Colin Convey '97, on their taller Razorback opponents. If they can slow

Bloom Sighting at
Basketball Game!
By Agent Sculley

The Swarthmore community was
shocked at a recent Swarthmore Potato Bar basketball game to see our
beloved President, Al Bloom, actually in attendence.- Faculty watchers
among the crowd idenitfied upwards
of five or six professors in the crowd
as well. It was believed to be the first
time in history that so much interest
was shown by the faculty or administration of the school. Only theBloom
sighting, however, could be confirmed by independent sources who
saw Bloom wandering the campus
pickup games. This year she found with a map asking students "How do

tions infielding a team with an unfair
advantage in problem solving and
intelligent decision-making.
In response, the Swarthmore Economics Department distributed a student paper, written for its introductory course, which expounds the advantages ofinvestmentinhuman capital and subsequent rates of productivity growth.
The Cinderella season was sparked
by the return of two key players, a
bald man and a religious man. Prospects looked promising for
Swarthmore when Ben Schall '97
signed a letter of intent in the spring
of 1993. Schall hadledhis high school
team to three straight state titles and
was expected to lead Swarthmore to
success.
However, he decided toretire from
basketball at the peak of his career to
try his luck in baseball. Disappointed
with his inability to crack the starting
lineup and then frustrated by the
length of the games, Schall decided
to return to basketball after completing the one-month long fall baseball
season.
Also rejoining the Garnet was Kirk
Daulerio '95, returning from his twoyear mission in Armenia where he
founded a chainof Barbizon schools.
Early in the season, he was able to
surprise many teams, who were victim to a doctor's misdiagnosis of
"Shawn Bradley" syndrome.
Daulerio worked out in Armenia
with some of the area's finest and
tallest players but was forced to see
time at guard, a position to which he

cial "fundraising" luncheon with the
powerful booster group Friends of
Swarthmore Athletics. Rumors circulated that President Bloom was
actually trying to wrest power from
theboosters, whom some charge have
let athletics become bigger than the
school itself.
Chris Berman of ESPN noted that
night that Swat professors have a
mysterious aversion to sporting
events. Their report suggested potential medical or psychic reasons.
As one expert said "Thereis no other
logical reason for the lack of support.
The athletes comprise a cross-section of campus and Swarthmore has
an incredibly wide variety of sports.
Sports can play a potentially dominant role in a student's free time. I
don't think any professor would
willfuly ignore this opportunity to
see her/his students achieve outside
the classroom." Other rumors hold
that the missing Swat profs are too
self-involved or that they are stereotypical academics who do not enjoy
or take seriously athletic events.
"That's right," commented political
science professor James Kurth.
"That's precisely right."
Not everyone was happy with this
rare Presidential appearance. Some
football players broke down remembering their disappointment that the
President never saw any football except when powerful alumnus and
President of the NFL Neil Austrian
was in town. Soccer, volleyball, and
rugby players alike shared bittersweet

feelings. Was President Bloom at the
game simply because Swat basketball was clearly coming together for
its first-ever Final Four run? Sideline superstar Yelnik McWawa '95
shared his doubts. "Off the record,"
said the Rhodes scholar, "I get the
feeling thatAl's simply a bandwagon
front runner."
