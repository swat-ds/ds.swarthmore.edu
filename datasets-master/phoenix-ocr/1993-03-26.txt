Residents Protest Against Incinerator
Organization claims plant is health hazard to surrounding community
by JONATHAN SEITZ

rupt" and "in cahoots" with

Last Thursday, a group of over
30 members of the college community and area citizens packed the
Intercultural Center to discuss the
issue of the incinerator in Chester.
The installation generates steam and
electricity by burning trash. The
steamissold to nearby industry, and
the electricity is sold to places as far
away as Atlantic City.
The incinerator, which is
owned by theWestinghouse Corporation, is accused of being a health
hazard in violationofmany laws by
the citizens who live nearby. They
claim that the incinerator threatens
the health of everyone who lives
withina 14-mileradius of theplant.
This includes all of Delaware
County.
Before the meeting even
started, residents could be heard discussing their complaints about the
plant, whichincluded noise,rodents,
dust, and damage to their houses,
roads, and health.
The group watched a video
about the problem of trash disposal
in America. The video pointed out
problems with landfills and incinerators, saying thatthe ash resulting
from incinerators is generally toxic.
The video advocated reducing the
waste going to the landfills by
composting, recycling, reusing, etc.
Dr. Horace Strand, chairman
of theChesterResidents for Quality
Living (CRQL), addressed the
group. He said that over 400 trucks
come to the facility each day, starting around three in the morning, and
continuing at least until midnight,
even though the hours of operation
are supposed only to be between six
in the morning and eight at night.
Thedust stirredup by the trucks
gets into everything, and thenoise is
terrible. "People cannot even sit on
their front porch and enjoy nice
evening conversations," he said.
Dr. Strand accused the local
and county politicians ofbeing "cor-

erless" and docile community. The
area around the incineratoris populated with many senior citizens and
low-income families.
The facility, he says, is already
impacting thehealthof thesurrounding community. Children are suffering from asthma and uncontrollable coughing. Elderly residents
nearby are suffering from nervous
disorders which Dr. Strand's group
attributes to the incinerator.
The facility is also producing
spinoff industries, such as a sewage
treatmentplant, a medical/infectious
waste disposal and treatment facility, and a planned soil decontamination center the residents say will
also adversely affect the health of
people in the neighborhood.
The CRQL has attempted to
talk with Westinghouse and government officials, but they are uncooperative and simply give "rhetoric, lies and deception," according
to Dr. Strand.
The CRQL has drafted a set of
demands which they are asking
Westinghouse to follow.
Their demands are: first, host
inspectors from the community are
to be allowedinto theplant, with the
authority to shut down the plant if
safety violations occur. This is the
law, says Zuleen Mayfield, board
member of the CRQL, and
Westinghouse is currently violating
it.
Second, citizens in close proximity (about a 1 mile radius) should
be given the option to have their
property bought out, and the area
should be rezoned to be industrial,
not residential. The cost of this, the
CRQL says, would be minor compared to the over $3OO million spent
to build the plant. According to Dr.
Strand, no other incinerator in the
country has residents so close to it,
and this is the fourth largest incinerator in the country.

appointed to
oversee the plant's compliance with

Finally, no further industries
of this type should be allowed into
Chester. This would include the
medical waste and soil decontamination centers currently in the planning stages.
To show communitysolidarity
for their causes, the CRQL is planning a massive civil disobedience
protest later this month. They plan
to march in a mock funeral procession from the Media Courthouse to
the incinerator. They plan to shut
the plant down for "at least one
day." The group is also planning
imminent legal action against
Westinghouse, the city, and the

At the close of the meeting,
residents near the plant described
the conditions imposed by the incinerator.Cathy Morse talked about
thedust and how thepaint was peeling off of her relatively new car.
Another nearby resident, Eric Johnson, told of rats infesting the neighborhood, exhaust fumes from the
trucks, and the damage done to the
roads by the trucks. He also saidthat
many houses have cracked foundations from the vibrations caused by
the trucks, leaving basementsprone

quite an experience in itself. The pollution
level was such that dancers oftenhad to catch
their breath with the aid of an oxygen tank
between stage appearances. Kloetzel herself
developed a serious cough. She also discovered that news does not travel too fast in
MexicoCity. When she and her companions,
in search of some scenery, climbed a forty
foot ladder to theroofof the theater, they were
entertainedby a huge fire that was raging in a
nearby part of the city. There was nothing
about the fire in the paper the next day, andno

dangers if her interest in dance was a mere

London Laban Center for Movement and
Dance in the fallof her junior year, wrote her
senior thesis on dance history, and won the
Melvin B.Troy Award for choreography for
her piece, M?f On A Bus. She will be performing that piece, as well as several others, for a
seniorrecital (May 5) with Brian Kloppenberg.
Most impressively, she has reaped these accomplishments in a school without a dance
major.
Though a major is in the works, Kloetzel
will be graduating too soon to take advantage
of it. Even so, Kloetzel will head for New
York this August to audition for inclusion in
various dancecompanies, of whichher"dream
companies" are Ralph Lemon, and Doug
Varone & Co.
Kloetzel's commitment to making a career out of dance is undeterred by entries she
reads in The Poor Dancer's Almanac that
give her detailed information about how to
register for unemployment and obtain food
stamps. Although the almanac also gives
details about how to find jobsin waitressing,
office work, and manual labor, Kloetzel is not
sure what she will do for a self-supporting
job.

As most voyeurs are quick to acknowledge with a smile and a drop of drool, the
clothing typically befitting the warm weather
and revelry of Spring Break is a bathing suit.
Swarthmore senior Melanie Kloetzel, however, spent a good portion of her break in a
rubber body cover that, withthe aid of a small
fan on the side, could be inflated to a shape
roughly resembling thatof the Puking Man on
Monty Python's "Meaning of Life." This
fashionrisk was not part of a move to highten
sensitivity to humanity's differing body sizes
(the suit is known affectionately as "The Fat
Suit"). Rather, it was the costume for a
modern danceperformance thatKloetzel took
part in at one of the best theaters in Mexico:
Miguel Cowarubias, in Mexico City.
The performance, Laminar Love, was
choreographedby SwarthmoreprofessorKim
Arrow, of the Bridge Dance Company.
Choreographed in the mid-1980's, the piece
was originally intended just forArrow and his
wife but was adjusted to give a third role to
Kloetzel.
Kloetzel's description ofher role is most
intriguing: Arrow, hisfat suitfilled withinner
tubes, struts out on stage expressing his obsession withhis own greatness. Kloetzel then
makes her appearance in her own fat suit,
which does not appear fat since it is sadly
empty ofboth air and inner tubes. "I was the
poor little deflated thing that had no ability,"
explained Kloetzel. Arrow then abuses
Kloetzel in various ways, making a point of
his more sizable bulk by rolling over her
several times. Eventually tiring of this abuse,
Kloetzel trips Arrow and pushes him off the
stage. She then sits down dejected and remains dejected until she discovers the little
fan at the side of her suit, which she immediately turns on. To her awe, wonder, and
jubilation, the suit begins to balloon, and, to
express her joy at her new-found fatness, she
performs a solo.
Kloetzel estimates that about 350 to 400
people saw the performance, which, though
the reviews of it are not yet available, she
knows was very well-received. One of the
sponsors was so pleased, in fact, that he invited the company back to perform in an
October Festival in Guanajuato.
The company performed eight pieces
altogether, seven of whichKloetzel helped to
stage manage (the eighth was Laminar Love).
It was Kloetzel's first time stage managing,
though she hasbeen dancing for six years and
choreographing for two.
She described her experience in Mexico
as "very intense." The first dress rehearsal,
forinstance, began two hours before theopening performance. Kloetzel and Arrow were
accompaniedby three others in thecompany:
Arrow's wife, and two New Yorkers. Kloetzel
was the only student in the company, andfelt
she was "a little bit of an outsider to the
process," though she was surprised to find
that she "ended up having a lot ofresponsibility."
According to Kloetzel, Mexico City was

"Hands Around the Capitol":
AIDS Demonstration Planned
Less than a month away from congressionalbudget reviews and appropriations committee hearings, thousands ofAIDS activists
fromaround the nation will link hands around
the Capitol to call for additional funding for
AIDS research and care. "Hands Around the
Capitol" will launch a weekend of activities
and events for an estimated one million visitors participating in the 1993 March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights
and Liberation. "Hands Around the Capitol"
is scheduled to begin at 12noon on Saturday,
April 24,1993.
Staffers from the House and Senate Appropriations Committees have said Congress
no longer considersAIDS a spending priority.
ACT UP/DC envisions "Hands Around the
Capitol" as a message to Congress that the
American people will not stand for inadequate AIDS research and spending. Equal
levels ofeffort for every person infected with
HIV are needed, regardless of race, gender,
sexual orientation and age. A 1992 Roper
survey commissioned by the Gay Men's
HealthCrisis in New York found 88 percent
of those polled felt the government should
mount "a massive scientific effort to find a
cure and vaccine for AIDS."
ACT UP/DC is calling on groups and
individuals around the country to join the
non-violent protest by adopting sections of
the Capitol sidewalk. Civil disobedience and
arrests will not be a part of the action.
Weeks before the 1992 Presidential election, ACT UP/DC coordinated the largest
AIDS demonstrationever inWashington, with
15,000 people surrounding the White House
demanding presidential leadership to end the
AIDS crisis.
"Now we have a significant opportunity,
with a new administration in theWhite House,
to see a new attitude and change of direction
with AIDS research and care," said ACT UP/
DC member Bryan Barr. "We must now target Congress withthe same energy that helped

elect our new administration. They also bear
responsibility for the pathetic progress
acheived during twelve years of this epidemic," Barr continued.
The federal government spends $7O billion annually on science and technology, primarily for military research and development. "The country's investment in research
and development, at the end of the cold war
era, must shift towardcivilian needs, including AIDS research," saidACT UP/DC member Sean Bugg. Congress, taking their cue
from the new administration, mustfollow this
new approach to funding issues.
"Over the last two years, we saw congressional funding below what even Bush
requested," said Terry Beswick, AIDS Research Policy Analyst for the Human Rights
CampaignFund. "Congress has long been our
obstacle. They have moved far too slowly,"
said Beswick.
Despite the government's misrepresentation, there are specific areas where AIDS
research andtreatment require additionalfunding, including clinical trials, full funding of
the Ryan Whitecare act, andAIDS education.
"There are a variety of different treatment
trials neededwhilethe present funds are hardly
adequate to cover the continuing operation of
current sites," commentedFrederick Nunley,
ACT UP/DC Treatment Issues Coordinator.
Congress must also look beyond the need
for increased AIDS funding. There are many
non-cost elements, policies and strategies required to end theAIDS epidemic. It's timefor
Congress to address what the National Commission on AIDS calls "the patchwork, ill
planned and poorly implemented system of
care that exists" for AIDS.

24 event, contact theAIDS Action Allianceof

been going on. It's better to have any pilot than none," remarked Dumic.
According to one estimate, over 60% of the 1200 students of campus own their own
computer, and that the number will go up as the network acts as an incentive for people to buy
Macs.
RA 's in Dana and Hallowell are now signing up to be a part of this test project. Residents
will have to purchase a cable to connect their own computer with the network, and this cable
should come with a disk of software and information on how to install it.
"It is assumed that people who are not currently seniors will want a cable, and we will try
to make them available before the pilot has begun," commented network technician Eric
Behrens '92, "Seniors will probably be able to borrow cables, though details are not available

yet."

Intermittent sun exposure to

The stripper never arrived,
but police did, the paper said, and
that's when the students were
questioned. "We have been serving customers at Harvard University for many years," a worker at

Score Those Condoms!
College contest meets with criticism
by College Press Service
Northern Illinois University's
health center distributed 35,000
condoms to be judged by students
for "appearance, sensualness/comfort, smell, taste, lubrication and
sense of security,"but not everyone
was pleased by the Great Condom
Rating Contest.
Health officials said the Feb.
22-26 event was supposed to promote safe sex andAIDS awareness.
But critics said it simply promoted
behavior that spreads disease and
charged that the contest literature
may have misrepresented the
condomfailurerate among collegeage users.
Thefree condom packages distributedby the Health Services Department included seven different
brandsand typespacked with a questionnaireand a folder on the proper
use of condoms.
"We copied the idea directly
from Stanford," said contest coordinator Michael Haines of Health
Services. "The contest provides
feedback so we can find out student
preferences, while we give them
educational materials discussing
risks."
Haines said that the free
condoms, paid for by student health
fees, have been available for the

past five years. Students can find
them athealthcenters, Greekhouses,
and residence halls.
"We have cut the chlamydia
rate on this campus in half since
1989, and condom use has gone
from 15percent t042 percent, sowe
have some solid datathat says usage
and availability is associated with
controlling communicable disease,"
Haines said.
Not everyone agrees with the
idea of handing out free condoms.
"STD's and AIDS are behaviorally
transmitted diseases, and this contest does nothing to discourage the
behavior that spreads them," said
Scott Stocking, director oftheChristian Campus Ministry, who asked
students to boycott the contest
Stocking saidhe wasconcerned
that literature enclosed with the
condoms underestimatedthe rate of
condom failure in the 20-24 age
group.
"In thePlannedParenthood literature I read, condom failure rate
among 20- to 24-year-olds is between 19 and 36 percent The industry says with perfect use, condoms
in that age group only fail at arate of
l-2percent,"Stocking said. "I think
students have a false sense of security about condoms. Abstinence is
the only safety from STD's and
AIDS."

Suspect Arrested in Bizarre
Shooting Incident Before Break
Editor's Note: Due to an
oversight, this story was omitted
from last week's issue. We
apologizefor any inconvenience,

by MARK KERNIGHAN
On the night of March 4, the
Thursday before spring break, a
man followedhis ex-girlfriend onto
the campus with a handgun and
chased her for several blocks before he was stoppedby police. Owen
Redgrave, Director ofPublicSafety,
originally guessed that the attacker
had simply fired into the air to
threaten her. However, the town
police are now claiming that a bullethit her car.
"I think this was a fairly unusual occurrence," said Redgrave.
"We just happened to be the battleground. It could just as easily have
happened anywhere."However, he
warns students: "This is an area in
whichyou might want to take more
precautions."
This is one of the most bizarre
criminal cases in Swarthmore'shistory. According to Redgrave, the
woman, an "exotic dancer," was
called to perform in a dormroom in
Parrish (and thestudent living there
denies making the call). As she
returned to her car (or as she was

looking for Parrish, according to
Patrol Officer John A. Wesley),
she ran into her ex-boyfriend near
Papazian. When he began to yell,
she took off in her car (with her
current boyfriend), shouting to
three nearby students that he had
threatened to kill her. A moment
later, a shot was fired and the gunman began chasing the woman's
car down College Ave. Redgrave
believes that the man fired theshot
while standing by the woman's car
window.
OfficerWesley gave a slightly
different story: a bullet hit the rear
fender of the woman's car, and
when the police arrived on campus, the gunmanfired at them near
the Rose Garden. He is not sure
whenthe woman yelled to the students for help, but one of them
brought the police to campus with
a phone call. Wesley said the call
was a smart decision; becausecampus security officers are
"any shootout would be one-sided
till we get there."
Wesley said that after the victim gavethe attacker's name to the
police, he was finally stopped in
the town of Radnor, where a cartridge from a misfire was found in
his truck. He was charged with
attempted murder, aggravated as-

sault, and 12 other crimes. The
three witnesses have submitted
sworn statements for the man's trial,
but Redgrave is guarding their
names, since in a case this serious,
"there's always a chance of retribution."
The skeletonfacts ofthe shooting are old news to most students
by now; as usual, bright orange
bulletins have been posted all over
thecampus. PublicSafety also sent
out an all-campus e-mail message.
Redgrave said that he usually decides which crimes are worthy of
bulletins. Their purpose is to let
students make "informed decisions" about where it is safe to
walk the traintracks are one ofthe
most frequent danger areas and to
contradict whatever tall tales may
have been "passed around."
Redgrave said that this incident will not lead to more careful
safety measures or change the patrol policy, since nobody can predict where the next crime will occur, and this kind of case is not
likely to repeat itself.
"This could be a once-in-a[but] I can't say
lifetime thing
it won't happen tomorrow," said
Wesley. "There's nothing a student can do; I don't know of any
way to protect yourself from that."

Substance-Free Halls Provide New
Living Alternative for Students
by CHRIS PRIEST
Room choosing is rapidly approaching, and students have begun to considertheirhousing situationsfor
next year. Now it seems that they will have a new option
to consider: substance-free housing. Due to the positive
response from a survey given last week, the housing
committee has decidedto designate Dana Lower Level
as a substance-free hall.
Initialinterest in a substance-free hall was sparked
Derek
by
Lumpkins *96 and Sonya Smallets '96. They
spoke to Tedd Goundielast semester about the issue, and
he encouraged them to join the housing committee and
further discuss the idea. The proposed hall would be
composed of studentswho choose to live in a substancefree environment, and would be ready to make the
commitment. In the survey conducted by the housing
committee, many students defined a substance as being
drugs,cigarettes, andalcohol. However, thereseems to
be special concern about alcohol and the behavior associated withit "We wouldlike a substancefree hall to be
a place where students could live and not feel pressured
to drink," said Lumpkins.
This living arrangement was decided upon independently of the college's alcohol policy, and it is not
directed against the use of alcohol by Swarthmore students. Substance-free housing is intended to be just
another option for interested students. "Hopefully the
hall will be a supportive environment for students who
would like to live according to a certain lifestyle which
would not be possible in other housing situations," said
Smallets.
The decision to designate a substance-free hall on
campus next year came only after the large positive
response in the student survey. Many of those who
indicated that they were in favor of such a hall also said
that they were not interested in living there. However,
the number of students willing to live on the hall was
large enough to convince the housing committee to give
it a try. After some discussionabout thelocation ofsuch
a hall, thecommitteedecided to place it on DanaLower
Level. The hall would be small enough to work out any
problems that might occur without affecting too many
people. "We cannot anticipate the problems that could
happen, but having a thesmall number ofpeople will be
a good opportunity to see if the arrangement works. By
doing this pilot study, it leaves a lot of opportunity for
expanding into larger areas in the future," said Tedd
Goundie.
Sam Awuah '94, R. A. and member of the housing
committee, has given thought to the problems and issues
that could arise. Would there be non-alcoholic parties
on the hall? What if one of thehall members goes to a

party off the hall and returns drunk? These are issues
that will have to be worked out by members of the hall.
"I thinkthe students should figure out the specifics of
the living arrangement themselves, treating the policy
as an issue ofmutual respect," said Awuah. Another
consideration is that of the R. A. on the hall, who has
already been notifiedabout thedesignation. "Therole
of the R.A. should not be one of enforcer but one of
facilitator. This person should be supportive and
encourage thenotion ofthe substance- free hall," said
Awuah.
Dean Bob Gross is in favor of the decision
because it increases the options for studentresidential
living, but also because it raises consciousness of
larger issues. "The arrangement will provide a wayof
focusing attention and interest on issues that constantly recur, and it gives us one more way to talk
about it," said Gross. He is referring to concerns that
surround student drinking like the socialpressure and
lack of party alternatives, individual drinking problems that could lead to vandalism or sexual assault,
and underage drinking. "The concept of thesubstance
free hall also fits into the larger context ofalcohol use
on campus and may encourage questions and discussion especially since the college is currently in the
process ofreviewing its alcohol policy," said Gross.
As it stands now, there will be a meeting for all
students interested in living on the substance-free hall
before block housing applications are due. Students
will meet with the housing committee and a separate
lottery will be held to assign rooms on thehall. Those
students who are lotteried out of the Dana hall will
have a chance to meet like-minded students and still
have the time to form a blockthatwould be substancefree. The meeting is scheduled for Thursday, April 8
at 7:30 PM and the location will be announced.

Did I really say that?
To the Editor:
I knew something was wrong when Mr. Leahy (Joe Leahy '94) asked me if I
wanted to stop by his room to find out what I said in the article he wrote about the
debate team. Of course I couldn't stop by, and soon I found out what I said: I was
quoted in the February 26 edition of the Phoenix as proclaiming grandiosely that
"we [my debate partner and I] thought we would be the first ones to break. I guess
we'll justhave to win the next big one that comes along."For the record, I never said,
nor would I ever say, such a thing. Nobody should ever have to go to an author of
an article to find out what they "said" in an interview.
Apparently Mr. Leahy has forgotten that the debate society is not one wracked
by internal competition, orhas exaggerated the perceivedrivalry between the teams
of Messrs. Carney and Potischman and Mr. Feuer and myself into some bloody
internecine conflict that he feels may "foster future wins for Peaslee, and can't do
much to hurt the individual reputations of these young debaters." The debate team
does not operate on such a philosophy of internal competition. Some other
organizations on campus, and even some other debate teams, do operate on such a
principle, and that works for them, but Peaslee takes pride in calling itself a debate
society, not a team. Most all decisions are made by consensus, not a majority vote.
Members of a society do not begrudge others their victories, nor do they gripe when
bested at individual competition as Mr. Leahy portrays.
Apparently Mr. Leahy has forgotten the motto that Mr. Feuer and I were most
often associated withthrough this entire year: "We suck." We tell the truth: we don't
expect much, so when we do well it is wonderful, and when we do badly, it isn't so
bad. We would not hold the preening, prancing, show-dog expectations that Mr.
Leahy imputes to us. I would thank Mr. Leahy to actually consult with the people
he cites in any future articles he writes about the debate society, and to remember
that we don't "[think] we [will] be the first ones to break": we suck, we know it, and
we admit it. And you can quote us on that.

warped sense of what was justâ€” an individual who ignored the fundamental message ofhis causeâ€” thus, his actions should
be judged entirely independentof that cause.
This fact does not throw anunalterable
blanket of innocence around the Pro-life
movement, however. To remain blameless
for Griffin's action, those who are Pro-life
must remain true to their cause andrefuse to
accept or condone his behavior. Anything
short of a condemnation of the act is hypocrisy, and leads to the same emotional blindness that Griffin fell victim to.
Some of the more radical Pro-life organizations, such as Rescue America, have
been reticent to condemn Griffin's behavior. They do so saying, "Michael Griffin
was simply trying to save innocent lives,"
and "Dr. Gunn got what he deserved."
Sure, Griffin was a dedicated member of
their cause. Sure, Dr. Gunn was guilty of
committing thousands of abortions. But

groups seek to extend human-rights protection to the human fetus, believing in the
sanctity ofall life, born or unborn. Judging
from this definition, one wouldassume that
the supporters of this cause would oppose
the violence of abortion by way of nonviolent actions. For the most part, this is true
of the Pro-life movement. Opponents of

abortion traditionally stick to nonviolent
tactics such as sit-ins and marches, following the example of peaceful activists such
as Martin Luther King and Gandhi. They
prefer to pray for their enemies rather than
opposing them with physical force. Still,
even in the most peaceful of movements,
the threat of violent fanaticism is always
present What, then, causes someone like
Griffin to diverge so far from the nonviolent path that the rest of his movement has
chosen?
An issue as emotionaland controversial as abortion can often be a breedingground for fanatics. The more emotional
the cause, the more likely that the emotion
will blind the follower. As illogical as it
may sound, even a human-rights and peace
centered movement can breed violently
overzealous members.
It is doubtful that the word "hypocrisy" ever crossed Griffin's mind as he
killed the doctor. To him, the justice ofhis
cause simply outweighed the evil ofhis act.
He never thought about what his action
meant to his cause. He forgot that by taking
a life, he was going contrary to his Pro-life
belief thata// life is sacred. He had taken on
the characteristics ofall that he professed to
oppose. His emotion and dedication to his
cause led to the exclusion of any other
notion as to what was right.
It is important to keep in mind, though,

just because Griffin was unable to overcome his vengeful feelingsâ€”and in theend
proved himself to be a hypocriteâ€” does not
mean that the Pro-life movement has to be
drawn down with him by defending his
thoughtless action. By talcing Dr. Gunn's
life, Griffin is as reprehensible as any abortion doctor, and the Pro-life movement
should not waste any time in recognizing
this. If fringe groups like Rescue America
cannot see this, then they have already lost
the true vision ofthe Pro-life movement.
If the message of the cause is centered
around nonviolent principles, then any violence in its midst must be reprimanded and
removed. Just as Jesus rebuked his disciple
when he cut off the ear of the high priest's
servant
or as Martin Luther King condemned the use of violence to achieve freedom andequalityâ€”the Pro-life cause needs
to condemn the use ofany violence to reach
their goal. Sure, it might seem like a firustratingly slow and uphill battle; and with
the election of a Pro-abortion president, the
road does not look any easier; but in order
to succeed and keep their integrity, the Prolife movement must stay true to its peaceful
message. This dedication might seem difficult as the fight becomes more difficult,
and there will come times when it just
might seem more convenient to give into
violent, fanatical tactics as Michael Griffin
did. I'm sure it seemed easier to Griffin to
go shooting away rather than remaining
true to his cause, but patience and the willingness to suffer through inconvenience
are the trademarks of any successful
nonviolence movement. King realized this,
as did Gandhi, as have most of themembers
of the Pro-life movement
â€”

Author Douglas R. Scott wrote this
hopeful observation about the fate of the
Pro-life effort:"The pro-life movementwill
succeed to the extent that pro-life people
are willing to be inconvenienced." It is
important to remember, though, that this is
written as more of a prediction rather than
a statement of fact Success is a long way
down the road and will only happen when
approached with a patient attitude and a
firm adherence to the true principles of the
cause.

of a Liberated Man

Blue Monday Blues
by READ MERCER SCHUCHARDT
I'm a liberated man, which means that I'm oftenbusy doing
domestic duties in the one-room mansion that my wife and I live
in while she goes out and pays our rent by taking care of other
women's children. I'll admit that housework isn't much fun, in
fact it sucks, but ithas to be done and we aren't wealthy enough
to hire illegal aliens do the work for less than minimum wage.
But the advertising world could make things a lot better if they
acknowledged that new age sensitive guys like myself are
cleaning up after ourselves and our loved one. If they did, they
would show some sensibility, if not respect, by naming their
products accordingly. Instead, it seems, they are stuck in the
classic patriarchal rut that women are the ones who do the
housework and that their job as product labelers is to make
that job sound more glorious and appealing.
Hence the plethora of cleaners whose name evokes the cando mentality of women in the bomb factories of WWII. Cleaners
â€”

â€”

and detergents like Arm & Hammerâ„¢, Tough Actâ„¢, Directâ„¢,
Tackleâ„¢, Resolveâ„¢, and Boldâ„¢.
Next is the mentality that women could have been liberated
from domestic chores, but that they chose to stay home and clean
the sink. One gets the feeling that women were actually asked
whether they wanted to stay home and do housework, and their

answer was, "Yesâ„¢!" Other answers to this question were,
"Fabâ„¢ and "Fantastickâ„¢." Apparently tworespondents were
so enthusiastic about housework that the advertisers simply
characterized their answers as a Cheerâ„¢ and a Shout!â„¢ Another woman said she was going to give it her Allâ„¢. Taken
altogether, their answers were a veritable Cascadeâ„¢ of Joyâ„¢,
a Jubileeâ„¢.
When the love-of-housework appeal began to wear thin, I
think they decided to send the message that domestic chores
really took no time at all, and that careers were still available to
the women who used quickie cleaners and detergents like
Vanishâ„¢, Dashâ„¢, and Wiskâ„¢. Even this didn't work, and the
last gasp came in the detergentcalled ERAâ„¢, a pathetic attempt
to tame feminists into submission by appealing to their ideology.
This historical accumulation of namebrands no longer reflects
the spirit of the age.
I feel left out by all this. I don't mind if some women
actually do choose to stay home and have Mr. Cleanâ„¢, or even
the more aristocratic-sounding Bon Amiâ„¢ to help them with the
housework. But I don't relate to these false emotions or bestbuddies-in-a-can. I want understanding, not the feeling that I'm
being patronized. I want honesty in the names of my products.
I would feel a lot better about washing the dishes ifI could use
liquid Slop instead of liquid Ivoryâ„¢, a contradiction in terms if
ever there was one. A product called Low Tide could even
humour me into doing my laundry before I ran out ofunderwear.
Instead I have to use a condescending product called Fresh
Startâ„¢, a phrase that evokes a school marm's reprimand after
failing a test which just makes me want to punch somebody.
Even scrubbing out the toiletbowl could be a naval adventure if
instead of Vimâ„¢,
I could use a product called Shits Ahoy!
which just gives me the creeps, as if toilet scrubbing was an
aerobic workout.
I haven't lost all hope though. There is an oven cleaner that
has been honestly labeled SOSâ„¢, which is the distinct cry for
help you will scream when waist-deep in baked on sludge from
all the cooking of last year's tenant. My personal favorite is
409â„¢, which has mysteriously been named after number of the
dorm room that I was living in when I met my wife, the place
where we first declared our love. Housework is drudgery, but
cleaning the sink with 409â„¢ is pure nostalgia, like the memory
of a first kiss.

Military Integration

Clinton's Promise Puts New Face on an Old Issue
byDANOPPENHEIM

any sort should be discouraged because
they weaken the military. Straight soldiers
are able to control their sexuality while in
the military so it should be no different for
gay members of the armed forces.
One opposition to gays comes from
those who complain that by allowing gays
into the military we are condoning their
bad morals and sexual practices. As it is
presently there are gays all across the United

When President Clinton was running
for President he made it known that he
planned to lift the ban on gays in the
armed forces. Clinton has been in office
for just over two months now, and he has
experienced much unexpected opposition
to his goal. This opposition must be
overcome as the question of sexual preference is not one that is important when
serving one's country. The goal of the
military is to protect the interests of the
UnitedStates and toprotect the citizens of
the United States. To this day there is no
empirical evidence that suggests a correlation between a different sexual preference and poor performance on the battlefield, or that gays have a lesser ability to
fight to defend the country.
In 1948 when President Harry
Truman issued an executive order for the
integration of the military, his proposal
was met withtremendous opposition. The
objectors contended that by having units
with both blacks and whites there would
be a significant decline in the level of military discipline
and spirit. They also claimed that since soldiers are housed
in such close quarters it would be difficult for the whites
and blacks to get along because of their differences. As
everyone now agrees the integration of the military and the
lifting of state-imposedracial segregation have not posed
any problems for society and they have promoted greater
equality in the country.
Now in 1993, forty-five years after the integration of
the military we are hearing the same contentions about
gays in the armed forces. The objections are the same now
as the were in 1948 and the situation is not much different.
The integration of blacks was opposed on racist grounds
and the integration of gays isbeing opposed for homophobic
reasons. Top officers in the military have said that they
oppose the lifting of the ban on gays because the existence
of gays in the military would lower the moraleof the troops.
There is no reason that the sexual preferences of the
soldiers should be known when enlisting in the military.
The military is not a place where relationships should
occur, whetherbetween straightcouples or gay couples, so
the sexual orientation of the soldiers should not matter.
Once we legitimize the notion ofrelationships for military
personnel, whether straight or gay, we are straying for the
purpose of the United States military: to serve and protect
the citizens of the United States.
The opposition that the living conditions of soldiers
makes it very difficult for gay and straight soldiers to live
together is based on the view that gay soldiers will be open
about their sexuality. Gay soldiers should not be afraid to
admit theirsexual preferences, but like everyoneelse in the
military, they should not be exercising them because the
military is not a place where sexual relations of any type

they should not haveany ideas in engaging in relationships
with other soldiers. It will be difficult for soldiers to adjust
to living with gays, but once they realize that the gays will
not try to impose their sexual preferences on them it will be
much easier. Straight soldiers are not open about their
sexual preferences with members of the opposite sex
because they understand that that could constitute sexual
harassment. Along the same lines gay soldiers should not
be openabout their sexuality while in the military. If they
choose to do otherwise when they are out of the military,
that is their choice, but while in the military sexual preference should not be discussed.
On Tuesday of this week, President Clinton made the
suggestion that he would allow gays into the military, but
would give them separate housing away from therest of the
soldiers. This is a poor solution to the problem. This would
lead to a decrease in morale for both the straight soldiers
and also for the gay soldiers. The straight soldierswould not deal with
the gays often so they
would definitely look
down upon them and
would not view them as

normal members of the
military. The gays

TOM THE DANGING BUG

would also resent this
policy because they
would still feel excluded
because they would not
be treated like the other'
members ofthe military.
As far as the integration of the military is
concerned, the main difference between the issue of race and the issue
of sexual practice is that
one can be hidden and
one cannot. While in the
military, gays must understand that they are to

States and they do not give much thought
to the idea that they are exercising bad
morals. The expression ofthe opinion that
gays have bad moral character does little to
discourage their behavior so it should be
accepted that gays will continue their practices regardless of public opinion. Those
who argue against the lifting of the ban on
gays should realize that the admittance of
gays into the military should in no way be
viewed as an approval of their actions.
Sexual preference is not an issue when

protecting the country so this is not a
judgment of their sexual preferences.
One additional problem with the ban
on gays is the possibility of the draft If the
United States happens to go to war at some timeand feels
it necessary to reinstate the draft, there could be serious
problems with the ban on gays. If the war is one like
Vietnam, or simply one that does not have a large amount
of public support, this ban could provide a way for many
Americans to evade the draft. Instead of traveling to
Canada, or trying to find some injury in order to avoid the
draft, it would only be necessary for the drafted male to
declare himself a gay. This would not be a problem during
a war like World War 11, but during a war without popular
support, the ban could have disastrous consequences.
The ban on gays in the military should be lifted to
allow all people, regardless of sexual orientation, to serve
and protect the county. The United States has a duty to end
discrimination on all fronts. Because the military is not a
place where sexual preference is an issue the ban on gays
has no basis and should be lifted as quickly as possible.

Deep Thoughts

Personal Attack Not Intent of "Social Revenge" Article
by NOAH B. SALAMON
In her article last week, Ms.

Asahi Pompey selects one minus-

cule and superfluous element in my
article, and chooses to exploit it,
ultimately bringing against me a
very serious charge. She is entirely
incorrect if she thinks that themain
point ofmy article three weeks ago
Was to vilify her name. In fact, I
challenge her to find in my article
any personal reference to her whatsoever, besides indicating her gender and complimenting her on her
style (though never identifying her
by name). In misreading my article
as "an attempt to characterize my
project, my intentions, andmy opinion" Ms. Pompey exemplifies the
most serious impediment to reasoned discussion at Swarthmore
a hyper-consciousness of our personal characteristics that causes us
to read hyper-sensitively at some
points, and callously at others, obscuring deeper concerns. Ordinarily,
this would not warrant a response,
but as her letter unreasonably escalated the hostility and personal nature of this discussion, I must reply
by vindicating my name: her accusation that I am a "racist" involves
her in the same dangerous secondguessing about "my intentions and
my opinions" that she bitterly (and
rightly) condemns in others.
As a preliminary remark, however, I do sincerely apologize if I
mischaracterized the nature of Ms.
Pompey's project, but, again, characterizing her project was not the
main point of my article, and I was
merely reiterating what I overheard
("eavesdropping" is not quite the
right word, Ms. Pompey, because I
was involved in a discussion with
the gentleman you chose to interview whenyou approached)
and
only doing mat as a prelude to deeper
points. Moreover, as far as a lack of
communication, Ms. Pompey initiated that by failing to solicit my
comments, or even to address me
for that matter, though I was obviously party to the discussion that
she encountered. Had she done
that, perhaps the article wouldnever
have been written. Moreover, if I
implied that Ms. Pompey was a
member ofan advertising firm, that
is perhaps more to her credit, and
professional demeanor, and in no
way a detraction If that is in error
I am sorry,but that was the implication I received from my brief contact with Ms. Pompey. It certainly
was not the point of my article to do
anything at all to malign Ms.
Pompey, and I think that the tone of
my article is apologetic enough for
even the most sensitive reader. My
point was to make some more general observations â€”to abstract from
an episode I found particularly revealing â€”and not at all to revile any
particular individual.,
The most serious charge levelled at me is that I am a racist, that
I would not have assumed Ms.
Pompey "had enough white input"
had she herself been white. This is
fallacious. As I stated in my article,
"I was not asked to comment on this
advertisement, perhaps because
when the woman conducting the
survey stated that she wanted input
from many different ethnicities, she
was implying that she had enough
input from whites." My assumption
is very clearly related not to Ms.
Pompey's race (which appears nowhere in my article) but to the way
she phrased the question in my presence. Let's take an example. Say
you're German, and I approach you

with an advertisement that clearly
vilifies Germans. I address your
friend, with whom you were conversing, and who happens to be,
say,Native American. "I am soliciting opinions from different
ethnicities on this advertisement," I
say to your friend. After he gives
his comment, I turn and leave, never
having addressed you. Would you
have thought that ethnic considerations entered into my decisionmaking process? Is your answer to
that question dependent on my
ethnicity (notice, I did not give it, so
if you already answered yes, you
already agree with me)? When the
analogue ofthis situation happened
to me, I thought that ethnic considerations entered the decision-making process
especially whenMs.
but
Pompey explicitly said so!
not because ofthe interviewer'srace
or sex or age or etc.
We've got to get awayfrom the
dangerous tendency to blame everything on race, gender, ethnic
background, etc., and to focus unduly on these aspects of a person.
When I was a child, my parents
taught me to believe that people are
people regardless of color, that they
have flaws and triumphs,
excellencesand shortcomings. This
teaching is not good enough for our
world, whereit must now be subject
to the unreasonable caveat that only
people of the same race, gender,
age, ethnicity, etc. can point out
thoseflaws withoutbeing subject to
the accusation that they are only
pointing them out because thatperson is Xrace,X sex, X age, etc. That
is not to say that I was pointing out
anything wrong with Ms. Pompey
orher project, because I wasn't. But
I am now.
In science, simplicity often
vindicates one of two theories of
equal explanatory value. Thus rain
is explainedby the collisionof highatmospheric pressure systems and
not withreference to Martians plotting our H.G. Wellsian destruction
through inundation. The motion of
the planets is explained by gravity
and not by epicycles. The tendency
to violate this law of simplicity in
discussions of race makes reasoned
argument a sisyphean labor. Ms.
Pompey is a perfect example: instead of accepting my own simple
explanation for my superfluous and
extraneous comment, she chooses
the Martians, chooses the intricate
psychological insight that I am a
racist and that my comment is related not to the more obvious explanation I gave in my article (more
obvious not only because it was the
explanation I chose to give, and
because it makes more sense) but
for a deeper, more intricate reason.
And Ms. Pompey is unable to justify her opting for an alternativeand
more complex interpretation ofthis
episode: the only argumentation
she offers is really only an assumption couched in the rhetoric of an
argument. Her "argument" in its
entirety is: "Had it been a white
woman who was asking an AsianAmerican student's response to an
ad, would Salamon have assumed
that that woman had "had enough
white input?" I think not!!! It is
clear to me that Salamon was assuming that I did not want white
reaction because I am an AfricanAmerican woman. Salamon's assumption is racist." Not only does
she mischaracterize my statement
(for what I said was not that she
didn't want whitereaction at all, but
only that she perhaps had enough)
but she fails to enlist the explana-

Tory key to my comment: the fact

thatshe did more than appear she
spoke, and what shesaidâ€”not how
she looked
induced me to think
that she was looking for opinions
from non-whites at that time.
Moreover, Ms. Pompey, who
claims that my articleis "filled with
misinformation, base assumptions,
and gross, false characterizations"
must realize that she is only attacking about three sentences of a rather
lengthy article. The comments Ms.
Pompey chose to exploit were included only as a brief prelude to the
argument I wrote, and I even claimed
that I agreed with her policy, that it
seemed like a good idea, and that it
was done in a tactful and professional way. It is hard for me to
understand what crime I must repent of, and what it was that
prompted Ms. Pompey to revile me
so in last week's Phoenix.
Ms. Pompey, it seems, is under
theillusionthatmy article was about
her. In fact, it was aimed at exploring the implicit ideology in a piece
ofpropaganda with which she hap-

pened to be associated. Further, it
was aimed at extrapolating from
this one piece of propaganda to
larger questions involving current
trends in the social movements taking place in this country. Ms. Pompey
has effectively inverted my article:
while paying lip service to its main
themes, she has exploited a minor
character that could come or go
withoutaffectingtherestof the drama;
she has read Hamlet and declared
thatYorick is the major character in
a play about baby-sitting.
And this is perhaps the saddest
part of all of this. Ms. Pompey
sought to attack me personally, even
implying certain vulgarities about
my own consciousness, instead of
handling some of the more interesting issues in the article. That Ms.
Pompey thought it was worth her
time to write this quite nasty letter
to the Phoenix simply in order to
vindicate herself (but was there any
need? Had she been identified or
wounded? Was the article even
about her in any substantial way?
Did it even attack the importance of

her project?) and to call me a racist
is confusing indeed.
Ms. Pompey's overtlypersonal
depreciation and the severity of her
tone might have induced me to reply inkind, but I wouldrather not let
this spiral into the sort of personal
interchange that, howeverentertaining, is certainly not very enlightening. To go back to square one, I
wouldhave writtenthe article again,
in the same exact way, had Ms,
Pompey been any color of therainbow, any nationality on the globe,
any religious or sexual persuasion,
and any political affiliation you
choose. I am proud of it, I stand
behind what it says, and I welcome
a reasonable and mature reaction to
the true issues it raises, but nothing
that employs sensationalist tactics
like invoking the specter of racism
and emboldening and capitalizing
sentences and inflammatory phrases
seeking to discount what is, I
think, a valid opinion by means of a
shady personal attack that seems,
ultimately, both unnecessary and
without basis.

College Must Reform Tarble Credit System
by DAVID CARNEY and NEAL
POTISCHMAN

the turkey sandwich, the medium
coke, and the brownie, wouldleave
you hungry and out $2.00 of your

Many recent letters and articles have attacked the College's
food service. We do not want to
complain about the food, since it
has gotten better since last year.
However, the situation regarding
credit at Tarble is ridiculous. We
will do a meal-by-meal analysis.
Breakfast: Yougets2.oo. Better hold off on that large orange
juice, because it is going to cost
you. In fact, we cannotbuy a bagel
and a large orange juice on credit.
Does this seem fair? When we
went to ACME two days ago, we
were able to buy a half gallon of
freshly squeezed, not from concentrate orange juice for 99 cents.
Now, considering that the College
can buy in bulk (unlike us), and
considering that their orange juice
is just a wee bit more watery than
Tropicana, we are confused. In
theory, the College could be shopping at ACME every morning and
giving us better prices than are
currently in place.
But what ifyou wanted to buy
bottles of soda instead of eating
breakfast? The $l.lO bottles of
soda are priced so that you cannot
buy two on credit. Coincidence?
We think not. Where else in the
world does a 16-ounce bottle of
soda cost $1.10? Maybe in Russia.
But again, we could purchase the
bottles of soda more cheaply in the
supermarket and it appears that the
College should do so.
Lunch: You get $2.75. Now
you can get that large orange juice,
but don't even look at anything
else. In fact, any deli sandwich
costs $2.65, so be prepared to use
that dime wisely. So, what do they
mean by lunch credit? What kind,
of lunch do they expect us to eat
with $2.75 credit and inflated
prices? You could saunter over to
the $ I+yogurt, but just remember,
add 10 cents to all pre-packaged
foods. As best we can tell, the
lunch they expect us to eat consists
of two pieces of white bread, cream
cheese not included, a medium
glass ofwater, and a bag ofDoritos.
The lunch you would expect to eat,

own cash.

Dinner: You get $3.50 if you
live through the riot, $2.25 if you do
not. The normal dinner price approaches being the first affordable
meal of the day. You still cannot eat
that turkey sandwich, medium coke,
and the brownie: the total for this
small dinner would still place you
over. However, you can get a milkshake and two bags of potato chips
withforty cents to spare. Might we
suggest you get four extra things of
cream cheese to apply to breakfast
during the rest of the week. By the
way, for health-nuts, try to buy a
salad. Croutons just are not as light
as they appear. To be fair, the dinner specials can be an affordable
way to eat. Just be prepared to eat a
meal in which you have no choice.
The dinnerspecials oftenseem strikingly similar to left-over Sharpies
meals.
Late-Night Snack: You get
$2.25 if you beat the 10:55 buzzer.
Examine the prices listed above to
see how little you get.

Perhaps we are displeased
withthe Tarble situationafter having visited Brown University recently. Our two hosts purchased
nearly ten dollars worth offood at
11:45PM, using the credit they did
not utilizefor breakfast earlier that
day. Not only is credit transferable
between meals, but it is more generously allotted by the food service
and can be used to purchase normally priced food. The food was
top notch, the prices better than
comparable, and there was credit
to spare.
We are sure there is a reasonable explanation for allof this. We
simply do not know what it is.
Operating costs cannot explain it
all. Why must prices be high,
credit low, hours short, and cream
cheese extra? The staff at Essie
Mae's shouldevaluate the pricing/
credit scheme they have come up
with, for it does not allow students
to eat reasonable meals. If the
"SnackBar" is supposed to be open
as a Sharpies alternative, than
changes should be made to make
Essie Mae's more competitive and
more realistic about student needs.

Needs ofMany Outweigh Needs of One
by KAR-YEE WU

POINT/CUER

One of the questions this columnhas
addressed briefly in the past is theissue of
how to define a country. It seems a central
quandary to our overarching questions
about sovereignty, but we really have not
attempted to resolve the matter. How we
define a country would necessarily define
or at least color our decisions to intervene
or not intervene, to infringe on a country's
sovereignty or not to do so. This week
represents my effort to provide an answer
to how a country is defined and why.
Set in the most simplest terms, the
manner in which we define a country splits
into two basic sides: do we see the individual as representing a country or do we
see the whole community? With respect
to intervention and issues of sovereignty,
which carries more weight, the needs of
the individual citizen or the community of
which she is a part? I intend to argue that
considerations and needs of the community necessarily overshadow theconsiderations and needs of the individual. Further, unless the community is threatened,
it follows from this argument that we
should not intervene.
Why is the community more important than the individual? A community is
made up of individuals; shouldn't the
needs of the individual take precedence
because itis the individual that constitutes
the community? My answer is no. In
forming a community, individuals necessarily sacrifice a part of their own identity

The Rights
by LIGEIA JENNIS

and self-determination tocreate theshared
identity and superior authority ofthe community. This idea relates to the concept
of the social contract. If one becomes a
member of a community, one necessarily
abides by its prevailing rules. In return,
the community provides security, stability, and identity for theindividual. Corn-

open warfare at any moment. By subsuming the individual, a community prevents anarchy or chaos. To borrow from
a friend of mine, general freedom guarantees individual freedom and not the
other way around. What needs to get
done in order to benefit the members of
the community will get done and unlike

In forming a community, individuals necessarily
sacrifice a part of their own identity and selfdetermination to create the shared identity and
superior authority of the community.
munal identity for the individual can be
couched both in terms of assent with or
dissent against the community, as in patriots or dissidents. However, it is the
individual's take on the community's
mores that contributes to theindividual's
identity.
A community also promotes stability and security for the individual. By
creating a community, individuals create
communal rules of living. These rules
cannotplease everyone,but they can provide the rules necessary to prevent the
world dissolving into a Hobbesian world
that lacks the necessary controlling Leviathan. As someone once said (I wish I
remembered who), manners are what
keeps humanity from breaking out into

theU.S. Congress, special interestgroups
will not rule and only provide for the
needs of the few.
I am not arguing for a society ruled
by Big Brother. A social contract should
beflexible enough to allowfor individual
freedom. As much as an individual has a
responsibility to the community, so does
the community have a responsibility to
the individual. A community needs to
recognize theneeds ofits individuals, but
it cannot and should not try to satisfy
each and every individual whim. If it did,
the community and by extension country
would not be able to achieve anything.
One cannot make an omelet without
breaking a few eggs.
Further, one cannotforce a commu-

nity to change withoutconsequence to its
members just like one cannot force
communist China to change to a democracy until it is more ready for change.
Change frightens people and few ever
have the courage to see change to its
conclusion. Communal change does not
happen immediately but requires time
and often sacrifice on the part of those
who wish to effect change. I am not
arguing for stagnation. When enough
members of a community feel change is
required, then change will occur. The
rules will be rewritten and a new social
contract will be drawn up. However,
when push comes to shove, individual
needs and wants are less important than
maintaining a functioning community
with a viable social contract.
In returning to the issue of defining
a country, my argument Jeads me to
describe a country as a community that
happens to be madeup ofindividuals. As
such, considerations of the sovereignty
of the country take precedence over issues of the individual. Unless the
community's social contract with its
members is threatened, my argument
wouldlead to a stance that intervention is
not warranted. Being part of a community does command a price in terms of
absolute individual freedom, but theprice
one pays for not having the social contract seems higher. With a social contract one has recourse for justice; without one, each person is truly an individual, one who stands alone.

This Saturday brings David
Mangin and his critically acclaimed
lecture, "Psycho Killers andTwisted
Sisters," to Swarthmore College.
The talk, which will be sponsored
by LBGA, hopes to educate the community on stereotpes.
For the past few years, Mangin
has been teaching a "Homosexuality on Film" class at the City College ofS an Francisco. As a result of
his course, other colleges and universities have been exploring the
possible inclusion of gay studies in
the curriculum. In 1991, Mangin
won the Orchid Award from the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation for his lecture.
"Psycho Killers and Twisted
Sisters" is a combination of commentary and clips demonstating the
historical and recent portrayals of
gays, lesbians, and bisexuals in
mainstream media. Mangin uses
cartoons, movies (not necessarily.

dated like Alfred Hitchcock's
"Rope"), famous actors such as
Shirley MacLaine, as well as an
"educational" video for children.
Although the lecture is humorous, it relays the clearmessage that
media coverage of homosexuals
often consists of negative stereotypes. Mangin criticizes that media
representations indicatethat "lesbians are predatory, scheming twisted
women trying to possess their lovers and gay men are psycho killers
out to steal your child."
In an article in The San Francisco Chronicle last year, Mangin
posed the questions: "Why are activists protesting Basic Instinct!"
and "Should you Care?" "Psycho
Killers andTwisted Sisters" intends
to provide some answers to these
questions and address other issues
surrounding media homophobia in
the U.S.
Mangin will be appearing Saturday at 7:30 p.m. inKirby Lecture

Gourmets in Wonderland?: Turtle Soup and Oysters

Sansom Street Oyster House
The Roving
Gourmets
by DANIEL KAMIN and
SOPHIA LEE
There are those that dream blissfully of
the slimy, salty morsels, and there are those
that squirm and shrivel at their mention.
Luckily, Sansom Street Oyster House can
satisfy both raw oyster-philes and phobes
alike. For the lover, there are usually five or
six different varieties of oysters to try. True,
dedicated oyster maniacs will salivate over
Sansom's $22 Oyster bonanza for two, featuring an assortment of about twenty-five
fresh oysters.
If you only go for cooked mollusks, you
can choose from among many hot oyster
appetizers, including the classic Oysters
Rockefeller. And, of course, for those that
can't touch any form of mollusks, Sansom's
can bring you shrimp cocktail and a number
of salads and soups.
The main entrees will definitely get your
fish juices going. Not only do they have a
regular menu, but they also provide a daily
menu reflecting the fresh catches of the day.
If you are not a fish gourmand, the servers are
very well-informedand can deftly guide you
through the fifteen or so fish dishes on the
menu. If you are not in the seafood mood,
Sansom's also offersother meats like chicken
or steak.
Not surprisingly, we started out with a
platter of raw Chincoteague oysters and a cup
of snapper soup. It's been a long while since
We've enjoyed really fresh oysters, so when
the platter appeared in front of us, our eyes
glittered with gustatorial delight (well maybe

for only one of us).
These oysters were superb small (the
super-large ones looked intimidating), meaty,
slightly salty and tangy, andhad absolutely no
icky aftertaste.
Because fresh oysters are a rare treat, we
suggest making a ritual out of the consumption process. Definitely eat the first and last
oyster with no cocktail sauce, so you can have
a sense of the unadulterated flavor and give
proper homage to the oysters that have sacrificed themselves for you. Make sure your

rich, and soulful
perfect for the hearty
American diet.
Bread is very important to us, and we
believe that it can be a good indicator of the
restaurant. Sansom's serves oval-shapedminiloaves that have fine flour-dusted crusts and
chewy, substantial middles. They are kind of
like hybrids of good dense sour-dough and
crusty light French bread. Our first batch was
cold (sigh!), but little by little the buns got

warmer and warmer. The fifth batch was
perfection!
We ordered two entrees from the daily
menu
grilled shad and marinated grilled
swordfish. Shad is a seasonal fish, and, according to our server, should be ordered
whenever encountered. (Apparently, shad is
in its peak season.) The shad was mildly
redolent of the sea and pleasingly fluffy,
which was further enhanced with a crisp coat-

ing. The accompanying pepper hash, a slaw
of shredded crunchy cabbage and red pepper
in a caraway seed vinaigrette, was very fresh,
but a bit heavy on the vinegar. The broccoli,
although slightly overcooked, was steamy
hot and happily bright green.
The swordfish was a bit disappointing.
Although the fish was flavored well, the tomato sauce ladled on top of the steak completely masked any subtle ocean flavor. Perhaps there may not have been any subtle
flavors of the sea because the lack of tenderness couldbe a sign of having been frozen at
one time. The stewed tomatoes served on the
side were a bit too sweet, but still very flavorful withtheir alluring consistency and texture.
Our tummies were brimming by the time
we finished our entrees, and so we skipped
dessert. However, in honor of our Key Lime
pie loving friend, we decided to bring a piece
home. Compared to Carolina's, our friend
says this stuff doesn't get any honors. However, it did manage to bring a faint glimmer of
pleasure to his face as he licked the slice of
lime.

Sansom Street Oyster House is everything you might expect from a good oldfashionedfish restaurant, plus lots more in the
raw oyster department. The entrees look generic (complete with parsley sprig, lemon
wedge, and plastic container of tartar sauce),
the desserts are decent, but not phenomenal,
and the decor is simple and informal. However, the overall quality is solid, and the
service is exceptional, if not entertaining.
After paying the cashier for our meal,
we were accosted by our server, who bopped
our heads with an empty Cinnabon bag we
had left on the table. He had been eying our
Cinnabon bag and hoped that we wouldhave
left him the Cinnabon instead of a tip. He was
slightly disappointed to find an empty bag
and some inedible bills nearby.

Lavrin Lectures on Latin American Women's

History

Visiting Professor Overcomes Obstacles to Chronicle Latin American Women 9s History

by GARY ZINS
Professor Asuncion Lavrin of Howard

University spoke Wednesday about theprob-

lems faced by researchers when compiling
facts ofLatin American Women's History.
Following her talk, she presented slides ofher
research. She stressed the continuity of how
Latin American women have been depicted
since Colonialism.
Lavrin, a native of Cuba, has edited two
major anthologies: Women in Latin America
andSexuality and Marriage in ColonialLatin
America. In each of these books, she has
written extensive introductions about "the
state of the art" in Latin American Women's

History.

In a colloquium entitled "Writing the

History of Latin American Women," Lavrin
discussed some of the obstacles researchers
face in this field. "The Latin American system is very different from the U.S. system,"

she said. Since thereis verylittle funding for
research ofLatin American women,researchers on this subject "often have to have a
second job." Of course, the lack of funding
means mat "the field is moving rather slowly,
not only because we don't haveenoughpeople,
but the sources themselves are difficult to
find." According to Lavrin, diaries were not
kept by women in Latin America, but religious records were kept. Particularly, the
ecclesiastical records, "are as rich as the civil

records for getting into the daily lives of the
people."
Lavrin pointed out that oftenresearchers
have written a history of Latin American
without having enough information. Also,
researchers have often falsely assumed that
all Latin American countries are the same in
regard to women's history. "We cannotmake
assumptions that what was true for Mexico
was true for Brazil," she said.

America may not be able to buy books, there
are relatively inexpensive journals that have
short essays written by women in various
parts of Latin America. She stressed the
importance of women staying in touch with
women's issues. "The main thing is to have
a communication network," she said.
In the slide presentation entitled, "Latin
AmericanWomen: A Visual Memory,"Lavrin
traced the history ofLatin American women

Often researchers have written a history of Latin
American without having enough information. Also,
researchers have often falsely assumed that all Latin
American countries are the same in regard to women's
history. "We cannot make assumptions that what was
true for Mexico was true for Brazil."
Even when accurate research is published, it rarely gets to the people who need it
most "There is theissue of language. There
is a very tiny minority ofpeople who can read
English." In addition, most people in Latin
America can not afford books. She picked up
one book next to her and said, "this book sells
for 29 dollars..there are veryfew people who
can afford many books like this." She added
that inPeru, "people makebetween 50 and 75
dollarsper month." Although women in Latin

since Colonialism. The first depictions of
indiginous Latin American women by the
Europeans "were inevitably nude...this impression of the female nude pervaded over
threecenturies."Lavrin commented thatthese
portrayals "represented the human in the state
of nature....[C]onquistadors must have been
impressed by them."
But not all Latin American women were
nude. As the conquistadors traveled into the
highlands areas, they found the more com-

plex Aztec and Inca civilizations where women
wore elegant clothing. "Marriage with those
women was highly desirablefor the conquistadors," she said.
One of these women was Sona Marina
who became the mistress ofCortez. Marina
gaveCortez theknowledge he needed to carry
out the conquest of the Aztecs. "Marina has
been victimized by Mexican historians [who
say] she sold the people," she said. "However, I beg to disagree...that was more of a
male reaction."
Lavrin saidLatin American women were
viewed as objects of exchange. "Men gave
women in order to establish kinship and relationship with the Spaniards." Since the Spaniards "proved to be superior technically speaking, there was no other choice." However,
these women often acquired great positions
of status. They "had chairs which were
covered...and carried by slaves," she said.
Lavrin stressed the continuity ofLatin
American women as they have been depicted
over the centuries. She presented two pictures of peasant women: one was a drawing
from the seventeencentury. The other was a
photograph she had taken herself. "As you
can see, both look strikingly similar," she
said.

The presentation was sponsored by the
History, Modem Languages, and Soc/Anth
Departments, the Women's Studies Program
and HOLA.

(I'm leaning towards #2.)
Number One: the favorite sweeps, a la Dances with
Wolves. This usually means Picture, Actor, Director, and
sometimes even Actress. This year's top candidate for this is
Unforgiven.
NumberTwo: an underdog or otherwise unlikely movie
sweeps, a la Silence of theLambs. Sometimes the Academy
justlikes to be rebellious and give everything to an underdog.
(Watch The Crying Game for this on Monday.)
Number Three: an even distribution. Rather than picking a favorite and going with it all the way, the voters might
go out on a limb and award Oscars based on the individual
merits ofeach film and performance. Don't bet too highly on
this happening, though.
Now I guess I actually have to make some predictions.
Starting off with the Best Picture category, I should note,
in all fairness, that I have only actually seen two of the five
movies. What I lack in actual firsthand knowledge, however,
I have tried to make up for with intense research, extensive
polling and my winning smile. I do know all the nominees,
however, and I would be more than happy to share this
knowledge with you. The Crying Game; A Few Good Men;
Howards End; Scent of a Woman; Unforgiven.
The far-and-away favorite in this category is the NouveauWestem Unforgiven,starring, directed by, featuring and overexposing Clint "Dirty Harry" Eastwood. This film has been
recently overrated as "thecrowning achievementofEastwood's
illustrious career." Sure, I thought Unforgiven was entertaining, but in the same way I thought Raw Deal and Young Guns
were entertaining, and I'm certainly not ready to give them
any Oscars.
My personal pick for Best Picture is the art-house smash,
The Crying Game. This was one of the most creative movies
I have ever seen, and beyond that, it was exciting, thoughtprovoking, suspenseful and entertaining on all levels. It was
artful in the way that only non-Hollywood films can be, yet it
avoided the obnoxious, foreign, artsy-fartsy film syndrome.
Most importantly, it kept the audience actively thinking and
on their toes throughout the entire film, and kept everyone
thinking after they left. This last feature is something that I
believe should be essential in a "Best Picture," andThe Crying
Game certainly qualifies. Some may argue that it was gimmicky, but I think that a closer look will show that the true
appeal to The Crying Game extended far beyond "the gimmick."
As for the other three movies, well I think that they are
pretty much c annon fodder. A Few GoodMen is the same kind
of Hollywood blockbuster type that we are all familiar with,
and it typifies everything that The Crying Game is not (thankfully). While I have heard good things about Scent of a
Woman, I just can't get past the title. I mean, who's the P.R.
genius responsible for this title? When I first heard about it I
expected it to star Traci Lords andbe "coming soon to an adult
videostore near you."
Best Actor and the nominees are: RobertDowney Jr.
(Chaplin); Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven); Stephen Rea (The
Crying Game); Al Pacino (Scent ofa Woman); Denzel Washington (Malcolm X).
The popular focus seems to be
set on a battle between veterans

ever, is that he has also been nominatedfor Supporting Actor
this year, which could be a throw-him-a-bone outlet.
Eastwood, as I have mentioned before, is not made of
what I consider to be Oscar-stuff. Even if he does have it in
him somewhere, I don't think Unforgiven brings it out to the
extent that a Best Actor award wouldindicate. Unforgiven is
simply arehash ofmanyofhis otherroles, except this time it's
accompanied by an uninteresting twist.
Crying Game's Rea did a goodjob in a great movie. Even
so, I don't think he'll win, nor do I think he should. A good
performance does not make a Best Actor. Look for him in the
future, however; his quiet-yet-moving style is something I
could watchfor hours, and he does a fantastic job of creating
audience emotion. The movie was too good overall for him to
have stood out, however, and this, in the end, will cost him.
Denzel Washington, however, is a guy who has a good
shot, and I wouldlike to seem take itall the way. Look for him
â€”

to upset both crusty veterans. While I have not yet seenX, I'm
still going to give him the nod for Best Actor based on past

performance and word-of-mouth alone. From what I have
heard, director/writer SpikeLee wrote the part to show a wide
range of emotions in Malcolm. Writing these emotions is one
thing, getting them across on film is another, and according to
critics' response (and my roommate Adam) Washington did
just that. And while on the topic of Spike Lee, don't underes-

for playing a role that is so entirely without precedence in
popular film. While "the secret" might work against him in
the end, I thought the performance was unmatchable, especially after looking at his competition.
Lamentably, GeneHackman seems to be leading therace
for Supporting Actor. Ignoring the now well-known fact that
I didn't think much of Unforgiven, I just can't stand Gene
Hackman. I have never liked him, and every role he plays
instantly becomes annoying to me. His character was weak,
his portrayal was weak, and thefact that therole is considered
to be a "career summation" for him only goes to show what
kind of career it has been.
Best Supporting Actress â€”you can cut the tension
with a knife: Miranda Richardson (Damage); Judy Davis
(Husbands and Wives) Vanessa Redgrave (Howards End);
JoanPlowright (EnchantedApril); MarisaTomei (My Cousin
Vinny).
I'm willing to admit that in choosing Marisa Tomei for
My Cousin Vinny, I might be underrnining everything I said
about Clint Eastwood, and might also be threatening my
credibility in admitting that this is the only movie out of the
five that I have seen, but I am going to stick by my choice. In
all fairness, I saw

way, and Tomei did a great job. And if you think about it, if
Tomei can rise above the cheese to get an Academy Award
nomination, then there must be something pretty special about
her performance.
Best Director and the nominees are: Neil Jordan
(The Crying Game); James Ivory (Howards End); Robert
Altaian (The Player); Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven); Martin
Brest (Scent of a Woman).
If thereis a bone to be thrown, here's where I might throw
it. Eastwood, for the ability to put together a movie that got
many people talking about him and his illustrious career,
might just deserve Best Director. My only reservation would
be that Jordan's Crying Game was just so spectacularly put
together. (Have I mentioned this before?) If he doesn't win
this, he should most certainly get the Original Screenplay
Oscar; for that matter he should get itregardless of whether or
not he wins Director. It's undeniable that much of the Crying
Game's artistic attraction and absorbingplot is due to Jordan,
and he deserves to be recognized for it. Sorry Clint, but I
refuse to feel sorry for someone I don'tfeel belongs there in
the first place.
Well that's itfor the major categories, you know, the ones
that end up on the box when the movie is released on video.
There is one last category, however, that I would like to
comment on: Original Song. This category is basically
dividedup between two movies: The Bodyguard and Aladdin.
While Bodyguard did have one decent song, "I Will Always
Love You," it isn't in the running because it wasn't writtenfor
the movie. The other two are love songs that I'm sure brought
a tear to the Academy's eyes. Fortunately, they were able to
brighten themselves up with the ever popular Disney song-othe-year. First it was Mermaid, then Beauty, now with
Aladdin, the Disney monopoly is likely to take this category
for a thirdstraight year. This might be acceptable if the cutesy
kid-songs were actually put up against any competition, but
instead, the Academy makes the end inevitable by ignoring
anything out ofthe easy-listening category. Case in point: one
of the best soundtracks this year was from the movie Singles.
Any one of thesongs on the album could have and shouldhave
found a nomination, but alternative was obviously not what
was being looked for, even if it was clearly deserving. The
same happened for many of the artists on the Boomerang
soundtrack.
Probably the biggest tragedy for this category will be
when "Whole New World," the lame, mushy love song from
Aladdin, wins Best Song. It isn't even the best song from the
movie, with "Friend Like Me" (also nominated but less
favored) being far more deserving.
In the end, I'm probably off on all counts. The Crying
Game is probably too creative, and a old-fashioned standard
like A Few Good Men or Unforgiven will probably win in the
end. All the big stars will be be "so thrilled to receive such a
tremendous honor," Clint will probably receive the "crowning achievement ofillustrious career" and the losers will all
applaud graciously as thewinnerholdsup the little naked gold
guy; and you'll probably miss the whole thing studying m
McCabe.

timate the Academy's guilt for having spurned him yet again.
While awarding Washington might not make Lee feel any
better, it will ease the voters' consciences.
Best Actress and the nominees are: Catherine
Deneuve (Indochine); Emma Thompson (Howards End);
Mary McDonnell (Passion Fish); Michelle Pfeiffier (Love
Field); Susan Sarandon (Lorenzo's Oil). OK, so I haven't
seen any of these movies, but I really don't think that's my
fault. I mean, other than Howards End, have you even heard
of any of these obscurities? I know it's an old argument, but
there is a serious need for big roles for women in the movie
like there aren't any
industry. It isn't j
ther. I mean Michfemale stars ei- j

Emma Thompson are all well

Thompson's
Again for a great
performance by her,
specifically, and a fabulous movie, in general.) Meryl Streep,
and GlennClose, even GeenaDavis and Julia Roberts, are all
good actresses who should be able to have a decent movie
made for and around them every once and a while, instead of
being stuck in losers like Streep's Death Becomes Her, or
relatively unknown/unpublicized sleepers like Love Field or
Lorenzo's Oil. Perennial male nominees like Jack Nicholson
and Dustin Hoffman get that luxury, what's wrong with
having a recognizable role in the Actress column? It's not like
I enjoy standing onsoap-boxes (OK, so I do, but that'snot why
I'm complaining here); it's just that I'm frustrated that all the
Best Actress nominees are tucked away in movies that I'll
never get to see.
The exception to this, of course, is Emma Thompson in
Howards End. This movie is coming to Swat soon, so I'll
probably get to see it then, and because Thompson is married
to super-talented and super-accepted Kenneth Branagh, we
are sure to see more of her in the future. Also, according to
most critics, Thompson is a cinch to win Best Actress this
year, which probably won't hurt her image. Seeing as I
haven't actually viewedany ofthe movies in this category, I'll
have to go on instinct, and say that if her performance in
HowardsEnd was anything like the job she did in Dead Again,
then she more than, deserves this award. My only question is:
where was Kristy Swanson from Bujfy the Vampire Slayer!
Best Supporting Actor the nominees are: Jaye
Davidson (The Crying Game); Jack Nicholson (A Few Good
Men); Al Pacino (Glengarry Glen Ross); Gene Hackman
(Unforgiven); David Paymer (Mr. Saturday Night).
Not surprisingly, my pick for this category is Jaye
Davidson from the Crying Game. Put simply, he deserves it.
Not simply for having me totally convinced of and by his
character, but for turning in such a moving and emotional
performance despite the enormous complexity of the role.
Davidson gets more points for not onlybeing a newcomer, but

Swat Golfers Gear Up for
MAC Play After Tough
Loss to Methodist College

OK. So you probably didn't
even know there was a golf team,
unless you knew one of the team
members. But there is, and it is at
this moment hoping desperately for
a few sunny daysin a row. The first
:match of the season was scheduled
[for Thursday against Widener, but
was cancelled due to less than optimal playing conditions. Monday's
home match against JDrexel and
Moravian is questionable.
The golf team is looking to
improve upon last year's very disappointing season, which really
shouldnot be difficult. The team is
returning three MAC tournament
veterans, Andres Zuluaga 94, Brian
Linnekens '94, and Matt Metcalf
'95. The squad's other returning
players are Dave Jenemann '93,
SeanLatham' 94, and Rob Day' 95.
This year's promising newcomers
are Steve Stortz *95, Paul Kim '96,
and Jason Straub '96.

played a different course each day,

in an area known worldwide for its
excellent golf courses. On Tuesday, the Garnet tookon golfers from
Methodist College,the Division 111
national golf champion the last two
years. Despite playing against the
lowest ranked players on
Methodist's squad, Swat was, well,
rocked. Naturally, the loss has been
attributed mainly to the team's lack
of preparation for the match, with
possibly a tiny bit of difference in
talent
Fortunately, Methodist is the
best golf team the Garnet are likely
to ever face. The rest of the week
was spent inpreparation for thereal
part of the season, against MAC
opponents. Practicing mornings on
the driving range, then playing one
round each afternoon, the whole
team was improving exponentially
each day. Linnekens was looking
poised to usurp the number one
position from Zuluaga, and thefreshmen wereputting heavy pressure on
the upperclassmen. The trip, however, was cut a day short in order to
beat the "Storm of the Century"
back to Swat, and so far, that has
been that.

Evil Buzzards Enter Spring Season
Ranked 4th in Eastern PA Rugby Union

andJim Savage,andfreshman Jason
Dougal. Madden describes this
season's pack as, "a bunchofbloodthirsty forwards looking for rucks,
hits and lumbering tries". It is
obvious that theforwards are intent
on upstaging the backs by scoring
more this season.
After their game against
Kutztown, the Buzzards travel to
St. Joe's and host Princeton before
playing at third ranked East
Stroudsberg and rounding out the
season with Haverford and
Dickinson. The team'sstrength lies
in the leadership provided by the
experienced group of juniors and
seniors. Their keys to success
include the continuing outstanding
play of the younger starters and the
ability of die team to negate the
opponents' size advantage using the
post and clear offense. After losing
only one game over the past two
years, the Buzzards will have to
overcome a tough schedule to
continue their dominance over the
rest of the league.
The buzzards continued their
preparation for Saturday's game
with some intense, sloppy but classic
scrimmages. Someof themotivation
to win Saturday's game will come
from Mark Harris' pledge to shave
his head and Bernard Sturm's
omnipresent threat of frog jumping
to Haverford. Although there are no
playoffs after the spring season, an
impressive showing could earn the
Buzzards a higher ranking for next
fall's season. If you fmd yourself

as to what rucks, mauls and scrum

Men's Tennis Survives Challenging' Spring Break, Beats American U.
'

by HUNTER GEHLBACH and
BRANDT LINCOLN
Over Spring Break, the men's
tennis team traveled south to face
four Division I schools. The Bandits opened the season with a tough
loss to the University of Virginia. It
was the first time that the Bandits
hadbeenoutdoors in several months.
The conditions were as much as a
battle for the Garnet as their opponents as they faced high winds, glaring sun, and ear piercing screams
from a competitively aroused player
at the nearby women's match. Despite thesebrutal conditions, George
"Pukey" Khalaf garnered an impressive victory at number three
singles. When asked what contributed to his extraordinary playing
that day, he replied with a devilish
grin, "It was the southern hospitality that made mefeel warm all over."
The team then sojourned to
NorthCarolina to face Elon college,
a top ranked NAIA school. Although this team displayed as much
southern hospitality as Dan
Oppenheim received for his latest
journalistic work, the Garnetlooked
a little more impressive despite falling harder than theDuke Blue Devils did to the GoldenBears ofBerkeley. The bright spot of the day was

the sun and the women's match once
again. The men's tennis team definitely saw at first hand the true definition of a Southern Belle. However, the beautiful scenery was immediately turned off by that wonderful boy, Christopher "The Really Stupid Guy" Ciunci when he

asked one of thefemale tennis players for Elon: "Excuse me, is this a
co-ed school?" Now, is he the embodiment of Swarthmore intelligence or what?
The Bandits then faced
Davidson College. The conditions
were worse than "storm of the century." Wind gusts were so strong
that boats on the nearby lake were
capsized, but this did not stop the
match. It was only the third day
outside for the Bandits, but they

were already yearning for the
friendly confines of theLamb-Miller
fieldhouse. The only tennis victory
of the day was turned in by the
California tandem of Vijay Toke
and Brandt Lincoln at second
doubles. However, this great
achievement was only overshadowed by two more tremendous events. The
first was the verbal wizardry of Phil "Ass"
Rosenstrach in his oncourt argument with his
opponent. The former
debate club member's
only comment was,
"What a Vid Show! He
wassooooass!" The second event was the arrival
of a distraction so great
that first doubles had to
be postponed from the large lake of
drool that accumulated from
Wheels' gaping mouth. When
Wheels, a.k.a. "The Good Guy,"
was reached for a comment, all he
could say in a trance-like state was,
"Where's the GreenShirt? Where's
the Green Shirt?"
The men's spring trip ended
with a match against University of
North Carolina at Charlotte. This
was the best showing for the Bandits, however, they still came up

short of a win. "The Really Stupid
Guy" overcame his intelligence deficit and won at number six singles.
Barry "The Holland Fist ofPower"
Mook also contributed with a win at
number five singles. In his postmatch interview he contributed his
endurance to the adrenaline rush
that he receives from waving his
fists in the air after winning a point.
When asked wherehe learned such
a habit, he replied casually and
coolly, "It was a technique that
started naturally on the night I lost
my virginity!"
Upon returning home to
Swarthmore, the men's tennis team
hit the road one more time as they
traveled down to Washington D.C.
this past weekend to face theNaval
Academy andAmerican University.
The Bandits lost a close match to
Navy as Jeremy Shweder led the
Garnet with an impressive victory
at number three singles. "This victory took a load offmy back. To get
thisfirst win is almost as great as the
time I finally stopped wetting my
bed. I was fifteen at the time but
hey, that made it even more of an
accomplishment."
American proved to be a stomping ground for the Bandits as they
cruised to a 5-3 victory. Phil
Rosenscrotch won hisfirst matchof

the year at first singles againstGuido
Weinberg (and yes, that is his real
name. No joke!). The class of'%
had an excellent group effort as they
came up withthree singles victories
at three, five and six. The match
was clinched by Vijay Toke and
Brandt Lincoln at number two
doubles by winning a third set tiebreak. The most impressive victory, though, was turned in by that
sweet, adorable teddy bear, George
Khalaf. After three sets of tennis
that lasted over four hours, he displayed a higher tolerance for aching
blistered feet than he did for post
match celebration.
Coach Mike "The Totally IrrationalGuy"Mullan is very optimistic about the team's prospects for
the season as they face Division HI
arch-rivals Trinity University and
Claremont-McKenna this weekend
When reached for comment on the
Bandits' performance thus far this
season, hereplied," How'bout them
Golden Bears, Boy! Did they put a
hurt on Duke, or what?" As you can
see, his attention spanis quite short
and some times totally irrelevant to
the topic actually being discussed.
But hey, that's why he's got a PhD.
The Bandits first home match
will be next Saturday, April 3 as
they battle Amherst College.
