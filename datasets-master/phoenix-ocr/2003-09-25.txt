Poll shows alums
give, but not enough
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
ldremeal@swarthmore.edu

Most alumni feel good about Swarthmore. They like donating
money to the college and other charitable groups. But they are not convinced the college needs their help as much as it says it does, according to

a recent poll.

The Board of Managers, in its meeting last weekend, viewed the
presentation of a survey that sought graduates' "attitudes about contributing to the college." Swarthmore also hoped the survey would help
it "get some insight into the best way to communicate with alums"
about the capital campaign, said Dan West, who presented the results
to the board.
The capital campaign, halfway finished, has already raised $138.5
million. The college hopes to generate $230 million more by December
of 2006, according to West, vice president for alumni, development and
public relations.
West called the results "mostly very encouraging. We were pleased
to find a strong sense of loyalty to the college and a commitment to the

place.".

*

The survey also found alumni to be generally "philanthropic,"
Director of Alumni Relations Lisa Lee 'Bl said, with a tendency to give
"time and energy as well as financial support" to local and national

organizations.
What the college needs to work on, West said, is convincing graduates who already donate that they should give more.

Kashmir Conference concludes
with statement for resolution

no

stranger to the topic of Kashmir.
The son of Kashmiri parents and
the author of many articles on the
hotly disputed region between
India and Pakistan, Vaishnavi
was a veritable expert even before
he arrived at last weekend's

But
conference.
Vaishnavi, a Hindu, knew that he
was missing a vital insight into
the conflict that beleaguers his
religiously divided homeland: He
had never met a Kashmiri

Muslim.
For Vaishravi, a senior at the
University of Pennsylvania, last
weekend's Dialogue for Peace
Initiatives symposium was a rare
opportunity to escape the repetitive exchanges that plague most

discussions of Kashmir.

THE PHOENIX

The three-day event featured

some of the world's top experts on
the region, which has been cen-

tral to India and Pakistan's territorial dispute ever since the two

nations gained their independence in 1947.
That year, the Maharaja of
Kashmir acceded to India, which
is predominantly Hindu, even
though the majority of Kashmiris
were Muslim. Pakistan, a Muslim
state, has called for a plebiscite to
be held in Kashmir ever since.
Conference organizer Berna-

dette Baird-Zars 'O6 said that one
of

the

initiative's

greatest

strengths was its diverse lineup of
speakers, which ranged from aca-

demics and journalists to filmmakers
and
human rights
activists.
"We brought together as many
different sides of the issue as possible," added Anmol Tikoo 'O6,

another conference leader and a
Kashmiri himself. "The success of
the conference was in the mutually divergent views represented.
That doesn't happen often."
Interspersed among the con-

ference's five lectures and panels
were events less typical of an academic conference. Through trustbuilding workshops, cultural per-

formances and a South Asian din-

ner, the symposium realized its
goal of focusing as much on per-

sonal connections as on intellectual discourse. The dinner and
cultural performances drew over
170 people, which was 50 more
than the most popular panel.

A "bitter divorce"
Although some conference
participants were already familiar with the intricate politics that

September 25, 2003

"A large number of alumni aren't really convinced that the college
needs to raise more money," West said. "They're not convinced that
we need their particular help." The poll revealed that alumni believe
the large endowment and an absence of any recent financial crisis at
Swarthmore mean they only need to contribute small amounts, he
said.
The endowment is currently $970 million. But, West said, "the
endowment is basically there because of what people in the past have
given. It needs to grow."
Over 60 percent of alumni have contributed to Swarthmore at least
once, according to West.
Lee called Swarthmore graduates "pretty smart" and said they "had
a pretty good sense of how a college runs. They do realize Swarthmore
can't run without contributions."
A new goal for the college is to better inform Swarthmore graduates
of exactly why the capital campaign is taking place.
"Most of the people we talked to knew about the campaign, but most
of them weren't clear on what we were trying to raise money for," West
said.
Some alumni who donate between $lOO and $5OO annually might be
willing to give $30,000 or even $lOO,OOO a year "if they were convinced
that the college needs their help," he added.
The survey also asked alumni what they saw as the most important
features of the college. High academic standards and need-blind admissions came out on top, West said, as well as "some of the Quaker values,
such as social justice, civic responsibility and a strong sense of community."

Lee said the survey also sought to find out "what kinds of materials
alumni read and don't read." The college, she said, plans to "use the
data that we got to look at the messages we want to put in the materials we develop," such as the Bulletin alumni magazine and The Garnet
Letter, a publication about the capital campaign. Alumni, she said,
need to be made more aware of what, exactly, the college needs to fund
and why it considers those projects important.
"Our alums are pretty well aware of our campaign, but we might
need to get the message out a little stronger," Lee said. "We do get good
support, but, that being said, we're trying to raise $230 million."
Students trained by the Michael Cohen Group fielded the survey,
which polled 400 randomly selected alumni from the classes of 1955
through 1999.

TIMELINE OF EVENTS
"I got off the train at Pathankot
and right away had to pass through
a row of metal detectors. There
were jet formations flying overhead
every 10 minutes and soldiers
everywhere. I had never seen anything like that kind of military presence before."
Such is Kashmir, according to
Dominique Van De Sompel, a
Princeton University sophomore
who attended DPI: Kashmir and
who had lived in India for two years.
Below is a brief history of the
Kashmir region.
(Sources: CNN World News, BBC
International)

August 15,1947Pakistan and
India win their independence from
Britain. The two separate countries
are created by a partition plan in
the Indian Independence Act.

October 27, 1947 Kashmir, a
predominantly Muslim region, is
free to accede to either India or
Pakistan under the partition plan.
The Maharaja of Kashmir, a Hindu,
decides to accede to India in return
for military aid and a promised referendum. Today, Islamabad says

Kashmir should have become part
of Pakistan in 1947, because
Muslims are in the majority in the
region. Pakistan also argues that
Kashmiris should be allowed to vote
in a referendum on their future, following numerous U.N. resolutions
on the issue.

1948 India and Pakistan go to
war over Kashmir and finally agree
to withdraw all troops behind a
mutually agreed cease-fire line,
later known as the Line of Control.
1965 India and Pakistan go to
war again over Kashmir. The war
ends when both countries decide to
adopt a UN-sponsored resolution
that reinforces the Line of Control.

1972 India and Pakistan agree to
work bilaterally rather than via international forums. The two sides also
agree to respect the Line, of Control
until the issue is resolved. This
agreement is today used by India to
justify its aversion to a referendum
and to international talks.
1974 India detonates its first
nuclear device beneath the
Rajasthan desert.
1998 India conducts five underground nuciear tests near the
Pakistani border. Pakistan responds
with its own series of nuclear tests.

'

1999 The Indian Army patrols

Kashmir and India fights to regain

Pakistani and Indian military officials agree to end the fighting in the
region and disengage their forces."

Front. •

surround Kashmir, many Swarthmore students who attended were grateful for the
talks devoted to fleshing out the conflict's
historical context.
"Some people say Kashmir is the root
cause of difficulties between India and
Pakistan, but I say it is the effect, the manifestation, of their difficulties," said

Husain Haqqani, a journalist and former
adviser to the Pakistani government. Like
a number of other speakers, Haqqani
argued that the Kashmir problem is not as
intractable as it might seem. India and
Pakistan, he said, need only to realize that
"they are both wrong."
"I look at India and Pakistan as having
gone through a very bitter divorce," said
Haqqani of the nations' continual political
bickering. "But there is now a one-to-nine
imbalance in the countries' militaries.
India's interest is just in getting Pakistan

off its back. And Pakistan's interest is

building some relationship that's reasonable and peaceful."

Adil

University, stressed that the resources
India and Pakistan spend on maintaining
a stalemate in-Kashmir could be put to better use domestically.
"For the price of one battle tank, four
million children could be immunized. For
the price of one submarine, -60 million people could be provided safe drinking water
for a year," he said.
Najam posited that the Kashmir dis-

Indian and Pakistani policymakers.
"There is growing sentiment for the
third option," said Lifschultz, referring to
the option of Kashmiri independence,
even though, according to a Pakistani military officer who Lifschultz heard describing politicians on both sides, '"the buggers
have no guts'" to propose Kashmiri independence explicitly.

Where it stops, nobody knows
There is no question that, for decades,
India and Pakistan have been impotent to
resolve the question of Kashmir, and
speakers at the DPI symposium asked
their audiences to wonder why.

"It is important that DPI
never falls into the rut of
being stereotyped as hippies doing a peace camp."

Najam,

pute would be "one of the most easily
negotiable problems" in the world, if only
India and Pakistan could be made to realize that k is in their peoples' interests to

hard to do, he said, because "nothing

deflects attention as much as does
Kashmir" from the two governments'
political troubles.

the sociology of jihad and religious, warfare in-Kashmir. Linking jihad to a "progressively" developing sense of betrayal,"
she said that jihad arises not out of "rejection of the moral values" 'established in*
the international community, but rather
out of an appropriation of those values in
the face of "abandonment", by the same
international community.

region? The last 200 years "have made us

nomic spaces, but now huge political
spaces are being questioned and huge economic spaces are being formed," he said.
"The South Asian paradigm is much more
important than the two-state paradigm."

Looking forward
Even in the conference's planning
stages, Tikoo and Baird-Zars were
adamant that the DPI: Kashmir event
should produce a final statement, no matter how short, to summarize the common
ground meticulously mapped out over the

three days. On Sunday, participants spent
three hours doing just that.
Although the statement has not yet
been finalized, DPI permitted The Phoenix
to excerpt the draft recommendations.
They include, among others:

•The recognition of the current situation
in Kashmir as unresolved and unsustainable
•A lessening of force with a lasting
cease-fire by Indian and Pakistani mili-

tary in the region

•The opening of the three major roads
•The creation of neutral, mutually
acceptable mechanisms to facilitate

expression by the Kashmiri peoples
•Steps to decrease support
financial
and human
for extremist organizations.
"We want to make sure DPI comes out
sustainable," Tikoo saitl.
Already, DPI is planning future events,
as something

such as a similar conference' on the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
"It is. important that DPI never falls
into the rut of being stereotyped as hippies
doing a peace camp," Tikoo added.
If Omar Vaishnavi's story is any indi-.
cation, Tikoo and the rest of the DPI staff
are on the right track. He spent his three
for
days at Swarthmore sharing stories
the first time
with Kashmiri Muslims.
"They were more passionate about
Kashmir than I am," he said. "They're
trapped there, and a lot of them are really
poor."

And, he said, as an afterthought: "I got
to meet them. That was really cool."

Acuña lecture incites
student interest, anger
BY ELIZABETH COLLINS
ecollin2@swarthmore.edu

When a colleague asked Rodolfo Acuna, "Why have the Poles, Irish
and Jews made it in America and the Mexicans and blacks haven't?" in
a conversation over lunch, he responded frankly. "See this pea on my
plate?" Acuna said. "It's your brain. I'm going to plant it outside, stomp
on it and urinate on it. Maybe it would grow."
Remarks like the preceding incited intrigue and antagonism from
Swarthmore students attending Acuna's lecture "Is Antonio Banderas
Latino?" last Thursday in Lang Performing Arts Center.
Acuna, the founder of the first Chicano studies department in the
California State University system and author of "Occupied America,"
spoke about a variety of issues concerning the Latino community in
his lecture, ranging from diversity within the Latino community to his
opinions on Latino issues at Swarthmore.
Acuna said he appreciated that both Latinos and non-Latinos
attended the lecture, something that he rarely sees in his Chicano studies classes at CSU Northridge, where most ofhis students are Mexican.

“I don’t think [Swarthmore students] know
very much about Latinos. I don’t think they
care very much about Latinos. I think the
Latinos that are here are token.”
Rodolfo Acuna
“We’re not going to bring about revolution if we don’t understand
each other,” Acuna said during the lecture. However, in a later interview, Acuna postulated that the surface multiculturalism of
Swarthmore simply was a fagade. “I don’t think [Swarthmore students]
know very much about Latinos,” he said. “I don’t think they care very
much aboutLatinos. I think the Latinos that are here are token.”
In response to the lecture’s title, “Is Antonio Banderas Latino?” Acuna
said the answer depended upon the definition of “Latino.” Acuna said
that, according to the strict definition of the term “Latino,” the Spanish
actor is Latino because he comes from an area of Latin conquest.
Acuna even compared Banderas’s recent portrayal of Pancho Villa
to the white “blackface” actors of the early twentieth century.
According to Acuna, the actor should not belong to the protected
minority of people from Latin America because he and other Spaniards
have not suffered discrimination due to their “Latino” heritage.
Elyse Betances ’O6, president of the college’s Latino cultural group,
Enlace, said that it was this forward and insistent type of activism that
made the group decide to bring Acuna to campus with support from the
Cooper Foundation and the Intercultural Center.
“Acuna has deconstructed the Latino identity with aggressive measures, forcing the Swarthmore community to reexamine their attitude
toward Latino issues and the Latino community on campus,” Betances
said.

“We thought that Swarthmore students, who are known for their
activism, organizing and liberal politics, could learn a lot from
Professor Acuna,” said Becky Monarrez ‘O5, an Enlace member who
was instrumental in bringing Acuna to Swarthmore.
Acuna spoke about diversity among the Latino community in the
United States. He highlighted the existence of differences between
Latinos of different nationalities, citing the example that the median
income of a Cuban American is higher than that of a white American,
but the median income of a Mexican American is 70 percent lower than
that of a white American.
“Not all Latinos are the same,” Acuna said. “Puerto Ricans are the
most nationalistic of Latinos, but Dominicans are definitely the best
dancers!”
Statements like this upset some students at the lecture and excited
others.
“Acuna decided to point me out as a ‘Chilanga,’ which means a person from Mexico City,” Nicole Adelman ’O5 said. “Since he spent his
whole lecture stereotyping people, I interjected trying to tell him I was
not exactly a ‘Chilanga’ and instead have an identity composed of a
mixture of different backgrounds. I did not really understand what
happened next, but somehow he decided that because I was wearing a
black knit sweater and going to Swarthmore I was a rich communist
bohemian who liked to wear wool.”
“I liked how personable and down-to-earth Acuna was,” Anya
Carrasco ’O7 said. “I liked his boldness as well. He made very strong
statements that showed how much of a risk-taker he was.”
Acuna went on to speak about what he saw as a tendency among
Latinos to “identify with their colonizers.” He said that in the 2000 United
States Census, 40 percent of Latinos identified themselves as “white.”

Students get Naked
BY SARAH HOBBS

shobbsl@swarthmore.edu
Last Tuesday, students at the new science center got Naked. In the ongoing competition between the two coffee bars, the
science center will now be offering Naked
Juices in an attempt to attract a more
health-conscious audience.
Less than 400 yards apart, the two venues have struggled to find their own niche,

Gillin believes Naked's attractiveness
comes from a heightening of students'
nutritional awareness in the past few

years.

"Naked Juices is really trying to get its
name out on college campuses. College students have a reputation for only consuming pizza and beer. We want to change that.
College demands a lot of your body. You
should be given the opportunity to feed it
right," Gillin said.

and the Science Center is hoping that promotions, like the Naked Juice samples, will

attract loyal consumers.
Elizabeth Gillin, a promotional representative from Naked Juices, offered free

samples on Tuesday morning, attracting
small crowds of passing students to her
table just in front of the new coffee bar.
Students sampled flavors that are now
being sold, including Berry Blast, Green
Machine, Zenergy, Orange Carrot Banana,
Protein Zone and Well Being.

While most students paused only long
enough to grab a small sample cup, others

Philadelphia Orchestra performs professor's composition
Orchestra's new director shows commitment to new music, local musicians
BY RYAN CROKEN
rcrokenl@swarthmore.edu

In Professor Gerald Levinson's latest musical composition, Avatar, there is a motif that spells out "C.
Eschenbach" with musical notes to honor the inauguration Of Christoph Eschenbach as the Philadelphia

Orchestra's new music director.
Avatar
a word that means the manifestation of a
divinity in the earthly realm
was the first of three pieces
performed by the orchestra last Thursday, Sept. 18, in the
Kimmel Center.
Eschenbach, renowned as one of the world's leading
conductors, recently became the seventh music director of
the Philadelphia Orchestra. Levinson described his selection for the commission to mark this occasion as an honor
and a challenge.
"It was nerve-wracking trying to work against the deadline," Levinson said, "but the opportunity was irresistible."
Levinson said he composed the work in pieces primarily
during the 2003 academic year while juggling his responsibilities as the Jane Lang Professor of Music.
Fellow music professor Tom Whitman described Avatar
as "a thrilling piece of music" and described Levinson as "a
visionary composer with an extraordinary sense of
orchestral color and profound sense of musical time."

Levinson described his work as "very challenging and
virtuosic, requiring a lot of agility and supreme skill. It
needs a top-class orchestra."
The piece was followed by a performance of works of

to show that new music is what he thinks orchestras
should be doing."
Whitman said that in recent history, Philadelphia art
circles have had a penchant for looking to other areas for
their musicians and ignoring local talent. But Eschenbach

seems to want to reverse this trend.

"[Eschenbach] wanted the very first
piece he conducted as the new
music director to be an original work
to show that new music is what he
thinks orchestras should be doing."
Professor Gerald Levinson
Leonard Bernstein and Johannes Brahms.
Eschenbach's selection of Levinson's work for such a
an important event seems to indi-

prominent spot at such

cate that the conductor will be a champion of new music
and musicians, Levinson said.
"Living composers are a part of his mission,"
Levinson said. "He wanted the very first piece he conducted as the new music director to be an original work
September 25, 2003

"He's very interested in Philadephia," Whitman said.
"The community outreach work he's doing is just phe-

nomenal."
"Eschenbach has earned big

points

with his new

city's

new-music community by hiring a local and putting his
piece in so prominent a spot," The Philadelphia Inquirer
reported in a Sept. 18 article.
The performance of Avatar kicks off the Philadelphia
Orchestra's festival celebrating Olivier Messiaen, the
renowned 20th century French composer who served as a
teacher for Levinson. Messiaen's music drew inspiration
from the sounds of Balinese gamelan. Swarthmore's own
Gamelan Samara Santi will perform at the Kimmel Center

on Oct. 2 through 4.

Whitman, the group's leader, will join Levinson on
stage an hour before the performance for a pre-concert talk

and demonstration.
The Philadelphia Orchestra will broadcast the performance of Avatar during "Sunday Showcase" on WHYY 90.9

FM on Oct. 12.

Student Council unveils addition
to charter policy, fields questions
In an attempt to explain the addition of a registration
charter to the chartering options for student groups, Student
Council held a town-hall style meeting Tuesday night.
The new type of charter was created so that student
groups that might not warrant funding could receive campus recognition, Student Council Co-President Emiliano
Rodriguez 'O5 said.
Rodriguez said that "the entire motivation for this discussion came from a financial strain," caused by the exponential increase of student groups.
The new type of charter is intended to allow benefits to
fully functioning student groups that do not have a charter, including a listing on the college Web site and in the
Cygnet, Rodriguez said, but not to revoke any funding or
status from groups.
Whether groups will lose their charters, Rodriguez
said, will be "dependent on how fall chartering goes," but
is not Student Council's intention in creating the registration charter.
"The registration charter is an added benefit given to
groups that would otherwise have nothing," Rodriguez said.
The criteria that will be used for registration charter
approval will be the same as for Charter approval, Student
Council Co-President Anna Morgan 'O4 said. The difference is that they will not receive funding.
The Charter Committee also wants to help groups not

Three weeks of

with the announcement of an eight-year contract

The new contracts, which are retroactive to
January 2002, will provide workers with annual

raises of three to five percent and an increase in
pensions, among other benefits.
According to the university, workers who spend
at least 30 years on the job will receive an average
pension increase of 40 percent.
Almost 1,000 of the unions' workers are expected
to retire before 2010, which made pensions a central
issue in the negotiations.
More than 100 dietary workers at Yale
New

Industrial Union District 1199, turned down the hospital's contract offer last week. The workers will return
to their posts Tuesday as negotiations continue.

tion chartered groups was raised at the meeting, but
Student Groups Adviser and Charter Committee member
Melinda Lee 'O4 said that it is still unresolved.
The issue of whether the Charter Committee will censor groups with a new registration charter also came up,
but Lee said the committee would be "more there to help,
to figure out if something is going wrong," than to restrict
a group's actions.
Fall chartering will begin Oct. 6 and will be a "long
process," according to Rodriguez. He said that, while fall
chartering will be a complicated process its first year, in
future years it will become easier.
Fall chartering will not affect the funding allotted to
groups for this year.

Guinea Pig is Love.

So what's up with the new system? From what we can

gather, the clubs that used to get money are still getting
money (for the most part), and the clubs that didn't get
money still aren't going to get money (for the most part).
The main point of all this politics seems to be, well,
politics. The real coin that campus organizations are
vying for isn't money for photocopies and refreshments;
it's recognition. Never mind that whether or not you're in
the admissions handbook doesn't make a gigantic difference in your actual effectiveness as a group, what with
the bursting enthusiasm first-years have had for reading
that thing in the past. And non-funded groups seem to get
plenty of publicity by blowing a few bucks on photocopies
to plaster all over Tarble each week. We all know who
JATO and SATO are by now, funded or not funded, registered-chartered or not registered-chartered.
No, it's about something more than being recognized
by people, it's about recognition. Official recognition.
Face it. We as humans are naturally authority wor-

shipers, even within the counterculture of Swarthmore. In
some metaphysical sense, it does make us more important
when we get listed in something official; in some metaphysical sense, people see us as more important when we
get listed in something official.
Same thing, in a way, with regular chartering. Funding
is still funding and still done by the Student Budget
Committee, but now Student Council needs to have an
official written explanation of why you're getting funded.
Why? Because it's more organized, more structured
because they like to know and we like to know they know.
In a way, everything we do in college is a sort of microcosmic rehearsal for real life, and if there's one thing we
can learn from the way things get done at Swarthmore,
it's that no matter how much people complain about
bureaucracy, about titles and paper trails and red tape, in

a sense that's half the reason we do things.
Heck, if we didn't like writing about what we do and
having what we do written about so much, would we have
campus

newspapers?

Where's the mail?
Yes. ITS has a difficult job. They're not making enough
for everything they have to do, they're facing the same
problems that IT staffs all over the country are trying and
failing to deal with, and, if they weren't already doing
their best, we'd have no Internet connection at all.
Still, the most fundamental Internet tool we all use is email, and it ought to be the most robust. It's less of a big
deal if we have to wait to download our Blackboard readings, say, or if CS majors have to wait to work on whatever it is they do on the Unix servers.
But when students can't communicate with their professors to explain the problem, can't communicate with
organizations or employers, can't e-mail their worried
moms or even get e-mails from ITS about what's going on
when reserved-students e-mails themselves are cut off,
then a major portion of the lifeblood of the campus has
been drained.
Surely the mailserver switchover could've been done at
a time when we were less likely to be getting e-mails and
when a delay in receiving e-mails would be more convenient, like at the beginning rather than the end of a weekend, and at night rather than during the day
if the
switchover couldn't have been done during the summer,
when no one was actually here. And couldn't tests have
been done to make sure the server would actually work for
receiving outside e-mails before the switchover happened?
On a modern, tech-dependent campus like ours, avoiding communications blackouts ought to be our first priority, moreso than having the most recent equipment.

It was a pleasure for me to hear
such a well-informed and passionate
individual speak about a topic to
which he holds such a strong connection, and refreshing to have an
answer suggested to a conflict that
seems, at times, to be forever without hope or solution.
I come from a primarily proIsrael background. I've spent most of
my life living in a Jewish neighborhood in Bronx, New York, with the
exception of a year spent in central
Jerusalem. My parents are both
Jewish and Zionist and have raised
me under these convictions. To me,

Mr. Abunimah stated
that Israeli soldiers do

am not well enough informed to do
so, and, secondly, everyone is
allowed to his or her own set of opinions.
However, I do wish to encourage

believe to be untrue.
I was encouraged to see so many
people attend the lecture; the
Scheuer lecture room was packed,
and people camped out on the floor.
I hope that everyone will continue to gather as much information as
possible about the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict (none of which will be unbiased or completely objective) and

Please remember that there are
(at least) two sides to every story and
that very little can be taken at face

One of these events
was to "turn the Magill

In chalking at Swarthmore, these students knew
that they were protected by the tolerance and freedom
of speech that prevail on campus. Yet the existence of
this protection is no mandate to abuse it.
Chalking such inflammatory messages on a day
when the emotions of many members of our community were especially vulnerable demonstrates a com-

plete lack of class.

While the aforementioned chalkings could be
thought of as tangentially related to 9/11, there existed
a whole other category of chalkings targeted at
Swarthmore's two other favorite targets, President

the Swarthmore community once again demonstrated

Bush and Israel.
One that particularly caught my eye was "Save the
environment, plant a Bush back in Texas." How could
someone intelligent enough to attend Swarthmore
really be so arrogant and disrespectful as to use 9/11 to
attack Bush's environmental policies?
"Bush is a fascist," another message strewn about
Magill Walk, contained no particular substance and
quite obviously conveyed the chalker's apathy toward

their propensity to hold nothing, especially the memo-

9/11

Instead of taking a one-day break from their incessant anti-Americanism, some Swarthmore students
used the chalkings to minimize the events of 9/11.

Taking the cake, however, were messages such as
"Question Zionism" and "Remember Rachel Corrie."
Is Swarthmore's leftist population now in agreement
ment in 9/11?
Surely it must be; otherwise these statements
would blatantly contradict their intention to "reflect
on Sept. 11 through a lens of peace and justice."
Rachel Corrie was a brainwashed anti-American
radical, not someone worth mourning on America's
day of remembrance. I only wonder if she spent the
day of the attacks dancing in the streets with the
Palestinians in celebration of American deaths.
If groups like SPAC and Why War? are serious
about their causes, it would be prudent for them to
avoid similar displays in the future.
Regardless of their political leanings, liberals and
conservatives alike who would demonstrate such a
blatant lack of respect for a painful day in American
history will serve only to isolate those who might otherwise agree with their agendas.
Regardless of how much one hates the United
States, its leaders and its allies, there are obvious
boundaries of human decency within which to operate. On Sept. 11, these groups showed a blatant disregard for these boundaries and disrespect to the entire
Swarthmore community.

Last Monday, watching

Mercedes and entourage drive
the main drag of Upper Darby,
I was not only wet from the

downpour and tired from a
long day, but furious at the
prospect of being so close to

America's greatest enemy of
environmental stewardship.
The crowd had been chanting: "What do we want? Clean
Air! When do we want it?

Now!" in opposition to Bush's

JENNIFER HOLZER

Clear Skies Initiative.
But then, as the police cars
passed and we knew the Secret
Service and the Bush team
were within feet of us, a cavernous bellow erupted from the
crowd, and I found myself booing with all the resonance of my
female tenor. We felt the futility of chanting at armored cars
and so helpless that the mob mentality took over.
While our signs protested harmful revisions of the Clean Air
Act, the root of our anger was in the economic injustice that was
being made evident that night.

Out From Gaia

First, President Bush would excoriate the only legislation to
effectively clean our nation's air. Then he would charge $2OOO
per plate for this golf club campaign dinner while he shirked his
responsibility for improving the health, wealth, and well-being
of the average American.
Building alliances with the wealthy by cutting them deals
like the Clear Skies Initiative is the kind of blatant environmental injustice that provides the ammunition to do what we
need to: fight fire with fire.
We must use our consumer power to deal directly with the
market to promote environmental justice. Swarthmore is lucky
to have a Committee on Socially Responsible Investing to do
just that. This committee could effect the greatest change by
focusing its energy on promoting environmental justice.
Environmental justice (EJ) has 17principles, as drawn up at the
First National People of Color Environmental Leadership
Summit in 199
L
The first: Environmental justice affirms the sacredness of
Mother Earth, ecological unity and the interdependence of all
species, as well as the right to be free from ecological destruction. EJ primarily aims to improve public health, but at the
same time cleans up the land and water, ensuring improved
quality of life for future generations of every species.
Additionally, corporate environmental irresponsibility in
America disproportionately affects people of color. In correcting
injustices committed by such corporations, Swarthmore would
be affirming social, environmental and racial justice.
Swarthmore's Committee for Socially Responsible Investing
had a great victory last year when it successfully filed a sharewith
Lockheed
Martin,
holder
resolution
the weapons manufacturing giant, to ban employee discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Solely because of the
tremendous clout shareholders can have, I am disappointed to
hear that Swarthmore has just sold its shares in Dow Chemical,
one of the most egregious corporate perpetrators of murder and
environmental degradation in history.
This is the company that manufactured Agent Orange and
napalm, and is the world's largest producer of the carcinogen
dioxin. It is responsible most famously for a gas leak disaster
that occurred in December 1984 in Bhopal, India, where 8,000
people were killed and 20,000 later died from related causes.
Swarthmore's shareholdings are not openly public knowledge, so it's difficult to recommend a corporate culprit. For this
reason, I would urge the committee to make Swarthmore's
shareholdings open to an interested subset of the college community. Unless, of course, there is something to hide. I urge us
all to utilize our consumer power toward justice whenever pos-

sible.
I also hope that the Committee on Socially Responsible
Investing realizes that environmental justice means improving
human health, compensating victimized communities and
improving overall quality of life. I can't think of a better bang
for your buck.

(said Dean's staff, who were handing out tickets to keep
track) showed up outside Independence Hall, for a rally that
proved the candidate's biggest yet.
The number, like Philly Weekly said, was probably somewhere in between, and consisted of groups who seem the
most common carriers of Howard Dean euphoria: white colthe latter group
lege students and middle-aged, ex-hippies
consisting of people who, in one way or another, keep at
least one major element of their personality largely
unchanged from when they were in college.
Whether Dean can use this swelling group of supporters

to convince the ones he really needs to get the Democratic
nomination and the presidency
middle-class soccer
moms, African-Americans and enough voters in at least a
few southern states remains to be seen, especially in the
wake of the huge shadow General Wesley Clark cast across
the field last week. Those who already behind him are dedicated, no doubt. But whether their dedication can keep the
grassroots movement already behind the former governor
going and growing, or whether those aforementioned key
groups will look at those already behind Dean and recoil, is
difficult to tell.
Dean had a union debate to shuffle off to at 6:30, so the
talk was short, and not very substantive
he realized,
rightly, I think, that those in attendance were more or less
his choir, not a group of swing voters for whom he needed to
break out heavy policy. Mostly it was about fueling flames
serving up the red meat, as one pundit put it, that Democrats
right now are starving to have served to them. That we live
under an administration seriously out of touch with true
American values. That the power should be in the hands of
the people again. That Howard Dean will make that happen.
Still, though the rally itself was basically proof his campaign is hot right now, there were a few moments that
showed why. Talking about repealing the Bush tax cuts,
Dean ticked off a standard list of what many liberals would
rather see federal money spent on: health care, Social
Security, special education. This last point, however, he
directly linked to lower property taxes
a rhetorical move
aimed right at the heart of American moderates.
And I was extremely impressed when he showed the
temerity to actually answer a crowd member, who shouted
while Dean was quickly pushing his health care plan, "What
about the war?" Granted, his response fell a little on the
vague side, and it's one he's used before: "What about a foreign policy that's consistent with American values again?"
he shot back. But it was a response, off the cuff in spirit if
not in what was said. And though he didn't ask with the
same anger, he came close enough, and he got his biggest
ovation in return.
There were other clues Dean is not just Dennis
Kuchinich with better handlers, such as the average contribution to his campaign.
More to the point, perhaps, the fact that his voice rose at
all puts him head and shoulders above the monotonous monotones of John Kerry, Joe Lieberman and Dick Gephardt,
and the chance to ask that question to around 2,500 people
who showed up just to see him is one John Edwards won't
get until November at the earliest, if at all.
The whole thing just proved to me that Dean's team has
been extremely adept at mobilizing those same demographics who were probably already behind him in the first place.
There were a few signs, though, that truly slick people are
directing the Dean show. One of his campaign songs, "Stuck
in the Middle With You," is even better than Bill Clinton's
"Don't Stop Thinkin' About Tomorrow." And the Dean team
shrewdly encouraged everyone in attendance to follow the
candidate as he walked the 300 feet to the National
Constitution Center, where the debate was to take place. Not
real people, you
only was Howard escorted by supporters
see they also kept chanting his name for the first few minutes of the debate, so a loud echo of "Dean! Dean! Dean!"
could be heard, even over Al Sharpton.

letter

the

editor

Letter typifies hypocrisy
Dear Editor,
While I have come to expect very little from
Swarthmore students, last week's letter to the editor by
Mathew Louis-Rosenberg was yet another example of
hypocrisy and jaded liberal thinking. As he claims to be
personally insulted by Mr. Davis, I find his letter to be
offensive as well.
Though playing video games, throwing around a
football, exercising and hanging out at a frat may seem
to be too stereotypical and, by God, enjoyable, to some
Swarthmore students, I would like to remind our shallow-minded friend Louis-Rosenberg that there are some
students here who, in fact, think what you so harshly

disregard are activities that we enjoy.
In fact, what he described as an absolutely antiSwarthmore day is how I spend most of my days here.
Matty there should be reminded that, as he wrote to
criticize Mr. Davis' column for being offensive, he himself is guilty of the same. I personally found Mr. Davis'
column to be funny, witty and well written; in fact, I
saved the piece.
I applaud the editors of The Phoenix for printing a col-

IS YOUR

umn that promotes a different idea from what most of
The Phoenix is: a liberal propaganda fiasco. Though my
convictions are in contrast to those of many Swarthmore
students, I have accepted what others write and say as
their own beliefs, though sometimes offensive.
I do not try to silence them. It so happens that I am
one of the people here who do enjoy football, meat, beer
and attractive women (in no particular order). It is nice
to read once in a while that some people share your
views. I thought that Swarthmore was a place where;
one could express oneself; but it appears that you can
only do that if you are an unatheletic vegan, a conniving, lying president of a college or someone who can't

deal with society enough to be comfortable in a fraternity house.
So, once again, I praise the Phoenix staff and editors
for publishing Davis' column and Mathew LouisRosenberg
hypocritical
for highlighting how
Swarthmore College is.
And that Rico Suave guy Davis was talking about is
a good dude.

Swat hosts symposium on Div. III athletics
Speakers discuss the growing crisis facing small colleges attempting to successfully
integrate a competitive athletics program into an academically rigorous environment
BY PAUL GOLDSMITH-PINKHAM AND
DERRICK WU
pgoldsml@swarthmore.edu
dwul@swarthmore.edu
In the wake of two newly released books
detailing the problems facing Div. 11l athletics, rumors about an NCAA referendum
concerning the state of Div. 11l athletics
and the third anniversary of Swarthmore's

football, wrestling and badminton
cuts, Swarthmore College hosted a symposium entitled "Current Issues and
varsity

Challenges in Division

111 Athletics."

Swarthmore's athletic director (AD) Adam
Hertz and assistant AD and women's
lacrosse coach Karen Borbee assembled
five Div. 11l ADs from Macalester, Colby,
Haverford, Bryn Mawr and Dickinson as
well as the executive director of the

Centennial Conference to speak at the
four-hour event in the Science Center lecture hall. The symposium was moderated
by David Gelber '63, a Peabody Award winning executive producer at CBS.
The discussion mainly focused on the
current challenge of integrating a successful Div. 11l athletics program into a highly
rigorous academic college. Div. 11l is currently composed of 425 colleges, ranging in
size from a few hundred to tens of thousands of students. As college athletics has

become increasingly competitive and specialized, small Div. 11l colleges have struggled to build winning programs without

compromising the academic rigors and
values of the college.
Some colleges, such as Mt. Union, have
responded to the escalating athletics arms
race by committing an inordinate amount
of resources to a winning program. The
seven-time national champion Purple
Raiders currently boast a squad so large
that one in three males attending the college are football players, according to

Steven Ulrich, the executive director of the

Centennial Conference. Other colleges,
such as Colby, have managed to remain
successful by dedicated coaches that
"recruit well beyond the realm of normalcy," according to Dick Whitmore, assistant
AD of Colby.
Other colleges have not been so successful. Vanessa Seljsekog, assistant AD at

Macalester, notes that it is not unusual for

Macalester coaches to spend more than 50%
of their time recruiting applicants. The
football team, for example, works from a

AD Amy Campbell, it is in large part due
to the social pressures that face the decisionmakers of Div. 11l athletics. As young
athletes have become increasingly specialized, colleges have had to respond by
recruiting more athletes because they play
only one sport. The well-rounded athlete,

much like the well-rounded student, has

Seljsekog voiced her doubt about the
feasibility of this idea. "Recruiting is a
necessary evil," she said. "To be honest, I
see some real hurdles [to the implementation of Whitmore's idea]."
Ulrich agreed that solutions have not
been forthcoming. "It's been hard to find
common ground in just 32 of the 425 col-

leges in Div. III."
The symposium addressed many of the
issues discussed in "Reclaiming the
Game," by William G. Bowen, Sarah A.
Levin and Martin A. Kurzweil, and "The
Game of Life," by James L. Shulman and
Bowen. The speakers continually made
reference to these books throughout their
talks and noted the books' impact on this

liberal arts colleges such as Swarthmore and Haverford.
While Kammerstein did not endorse the
idea of giving varsity athletes academic
credit for participating in sports, he suggested that sports should be considered as
a performance, much like dance, theater
and art classes. He also suggested that
coaches, who often voice their frustration
as second-class faculty at colleges, can
give lessons in pedagogy to other faculty

members.
Whitmore by far proposed the most
radical change. He suggested that Div. 11l
should split into two, such that a selfselected group of colleges form a Div. lIIA
or Div. IV. This new division would
reform the recruitment process by eliminating contact between student athletes

Opinions about the symposium were
mostly tepid. While the first three speak-

ers addressed the issues facing the athletics programs, "only one of the three
showed any solutions to the problems,"
physics professor Peter Collings said.
"It was interesting stuff but some of the

stuff was like 'Yeah

Student attendance was surprisingly
low at the conference. Several audience
members bore name tags that said "Mind
the Light" beneath their names. The symposium's attendance consisted mostly of

alumni, faculty and members of the general community.
Hertz opened the discussion by aptly
calling the NCAA "an association divided." That seems to be the only question
settled thus far in this ongoing debate.

win the contest 7-0.

The men's soccer team moved to 2-6 on the season last week with a blowout win against
Neumann 7-0 followed by a tough loss in its
Centennial Conference (CC) opener against
Dickinson 0-4. The Garnet also played the
University of Scranton on Tuesday night in
Scranton, but the results were unavailable at
press time.

Against the Royals Tuesday night, Swarthmore
looked to rebound following its loss at home
against Dickinson by jumping on the scoreboard
early in the game. 'lf we come out and play disciplined defense, and we're excited and aggressive
on offense, if we do that I think we'll be alright,"
head coach Eric Wagner said. "If we score, that's
big, because every time we've scored we've ended
up winning. I'd like to see a 1-0 win on our part,
because that shows grit and determination, and
it's something we haven't done yet."
The Garnet Tide last played the Royals in 1996,
when they battled Scranton to a 1-1 tie in overtime. The team will also be playing the game on
Astroturf, and the team's considerable experience
on artificial surfaces should help to nullify some
of Scranton's home field advantage. "They play on
turf, which is a little different than what we play
on," Wagner said. "But we'll be ready for it, and it
plays to our favor a bit."
In their Centennial Conference opener against
Dickinson last Saturday, the Tide struggled defensively in the first half, letting some costly lapses
result in scores for the Red Devils as they fell 4-0.
"We played well in the midfield, but the problem
was in the box oh both .ends," goalkeeper Nate
Shupe 'O5 said. "We made a couple of mistakes
defensively, and they capitalized. We played well

and controlled the game, but they finished and we

didn't."

The Garnet's play Saturday was a radical
departure from their contest against Neumann
last Wednesday in which Swarthmore hammered
the winless Greyhounds 7-0. "Saturday was a little

bit of a departure from Wednesday, as we weren't
as disciplined defensively," Wagner said. "Three
costly mistakes hurt us in the first half, and even
though we outplayed them, it was very disap-

pointing to be down at the half. It wasn't because
we weren't working, it was because we just made
'
mistakes."
The scoring bonanza against Neumann was led
by mid-fielders Nick Graham 'O6, who had a hat
trick, and Alex Elkins 'O5, who came up with two
scores against the hapless Greyhound defense.
The final tally of seven was the most scored by the
Garnet in any contest since 1994. "Nick Graham
had a bit of a coming-out party, and it was fun to
take it to a team like that," Wagner said. "We lost
1-0 to that team last year, so I know we've become
a better team, and that's also the first time since
1994 we've scored seven goals in a game. Our forwards didn't score, but some of them have been
injured, and guys have been going in and out of
the lineup, but they're getting closer every day.
Out of our seven forwards, five of them are new
players, and they just need to get to know one
another, build some confidence. I think we're getting ready to break out."
Swarthmore ' will' play Gettysburg this
Saturday at Clothier field in its second CC
matchup of the year, followed by another home
contest- next Wednesday against CC foe
Washington College. "We're feeling pretty confident," Shupe said. "We've been playing well; we've
just been a bit unlucky. If we play our game, we'll
be fine."

Garnet harriers race alumni
"On Wednesday, we didn't set the course on fire
by any stretch of the imagination." These are the
words of men's cross country harrier Garret Ash
'O5. However, the perseverance of both the men's
and women's cross country teams can be summed,
up in Ash's assertive statement,"" One thing is certain: this team Will get better every week between
now and November." And there ypu have it; our
Swat team started off a little shaky this past week,

but under the guidance of head coach Pete Carroll
and the experienced runners, Swarthmore should
present itself as a conference contender throughout the 2003 season.
But every team, no matter the results, is entitled to a little fun. And that is exactly what the
Alumni meet on Saturday was all about. A field
containing a total of 43 runners' ranging from mem-

September 25, 2003

bers of the class of 1970 to those of the current firstyear class, set off on the campus course to compete.
Although-the meet contained the competitive edge
present i»most races, coach Carroll described the

event as a means of bringing the Swa'rthmore cross

country community together.
The Overall winner of the meet-was Jeff Doyan
from the class of 'OO with a time of 17:59. He was
closely followed by three current Swarthmore students, James Golden, Lang Reynolds and Ash, all of
whom are juniors and finished with a time of 18:31
The top finisher for the women was sophomore
Debbie Farrelly with a time of 21:48.
Both tedms will compete again this Saturday in
Salisbury and are hopeful for improved times at
the faster course.

The Swarthmore women's soccer team won its first conference game this Tuesday over powerhouse Franklin and
Marshall College. The victory at Clothier field sent a
strong message, to the entire Centennial Conference (CC)
that the Garnet Tide is a playoff caliber team that is here
to stay.
First-year Natalie Negrey scored the lone goal of the
contest in the ninth
minute of the first
SWARTHMORE
1
sudden death overtime period off a
Jane

0
cross from
Sachs 'O7. The goal
was Negrey's teamleading fourth of the season. The victory was especially
sweet for Swarthmore (5-3, 1-0) after last year's crushing

double overtime loss to F&M.
In the opening half, Swarthmore was able to control the
flow of play through its impressive midfield and defensive
play. The Garnet Tide had the advantage along the wings
and was able to advance the ball down the field at will. Yet
the fast, strong Diplomat defenders were able to contain
the Garnet Tide in the offensive third of the field, cutting
off many through balls and neutralizing Swarthmore's
attacking players.

In the second half, Swarthmore was unable to keep con-

trol of the midfield as it had in the opening 45 minutes.
Fatigue began to set in for both teams as F&M's runs and

crosses became more dangerous. With few quality shots
on goal by either team, the game remained scoreless as
regulation play expired, setting the stage for Negrey's

heroics.
With the win, the Garnet moved to 4-4 in overtime
games in the past two years.
The Garnet return to action on Saturday, Sept. 27th
when they host Gettysburg College at 12:00 p.m.

Field Hockey competes at Seven Sisters
Garnet Tide defeat CC opponents Bryn Mawr and Haverford
The women's field hockey team competed this weekend in the Seven Sisters' Tournament at Wellesley
College. In addition to the perennial teams participatVassar, Bryn Mawr,
ing in the tournament
the
Haverford, Wellesley, Mount Holyoke and Smith
guest for this year was Elms College. Out of these eight
competitors, Swarthmore placed fifth. The first match
of the weekend was against Vassar on Saturday, which
the Garnet lost 5-3. Heidi Fieselmann 'O6 and first-year
Julia Morrison 'O7 were among those who scored.
Vassar had a strong offense that ultimately made the
difference in a back-and-forth game that featured several lead changes. Unfortunately, once a team loses a
match it is automatically placed in the losers' bracket

with no chance to win the tournament.
After Vassar, Swarthmore did not allow another goal
from an opposing team. The Tide played and crushed
Bryn Mawr in a 7-0 shutout. Fieselmann, Jesse
Whitfield 'O6, Emily Szydlowski 'O5 and Chelsea Ferrell
'O5 were among those who scored. The third and final
match for the Garnet was on Sunday against Haverford
that resulted in an intense 1-0 victory.
The tournament named one player from each competing team to an all-tournament team, based on a vote
by coaches. For Swarthmore, that was Chelsea Ferrell.
The Garnet will hit the turf tonight against West

Princeton University and Philly club team LOCA but
dropped a match to top-seeded club team Electric Mayhem
of Philadelphia. On the second day of play, Swarthmore
beat Bucknell and lost to Haverford and Rutgers.
Half of the Warmothers' roster is comprised of rookies,
and tri-captain Dana Variano 'O6 is confident in the team's
upcoming contests. In addition to the exceptional work of
the rookies, sophomore tri-captain Cassie Barnum 'O6
played despite injury to her throwing hand. For the second
of the tournament, the sophomore played left-handed.
The team looks forward to its upcoming tournament for
college teams at Rutgers University during the first week-

The Evil Buzzards fell 56-0 to local rival Albright
College on Sept. 20 in Reading, Pa. A contest between the
two teams during the spring 2002 season was cut short in
the second half because of a bench-clearing brawl between
Swarthmore and Albright players. Since then, games
between the two teams have remained very heated.
Co-captain Jonathan Fombonne 'O5 noted that
Swarthmore could not match up against the more physical
Albright team. With a higher fitness level and more experience playing with their team, Albright capitalized on the
Buzzard mistakes. While Swarthmore did not seem like
the same team that played in the Media Rugby
Tournament on Sept. 13, the men hope to find their game
and bring it to Saturday's competition against Lehigh
University. The home contest begins at 1 p.m. on
Cunningham field.

The women's rugby team proved successful in its first
divisional game against Widener University last weekend.
The Garnet captured the A-side game 12-5, and the B-side
game 15-12.
In the A game, Nicole Brunda 'O4 bolstered the
Swarthmore offense. While Widener scored the opening
points, Swarthmore's Brunda and Katie Merrick 'O5 put
Swarthmore on the board and in the lead for the duration
of the game. Tri-captain Kirsten Vannice 'O4 credited the
Garnet's physical fitness and mental prowess for the win.
In the B game, scrumhalf Liz Buckner 'O6, Reena Nadler
'O6 and Liana Lum 'O4 all contributed to the team's win.
The women will take on York College on Saturday, Sept.

Senior Katey McCaffrey a player to watch
Carlton sits down with the soccer co-captain to discuss pregame rituals, astroturf and more
BY CARLTON DAVIS

cdavisl@swarthmore.edu

Coming off a stellar 1-0 victory against Centennial
Conference foe Franklin and Marshall, the women's soccer
team is off to a 5-3 start and is undefeated in conference
play. So what makes the women's soccer team not only the
best fall team at Swarthmore but also the most fun to be
around? The answer is Katey McCaffrey. Katey Mac, a senior co-captain, leads the team in shots and is only behind
Natalie Negrey 'O7 in goals and total points. Her powerful
leg is a recipe for instant offense, and she has been known
to blast the ball past the goalkeeper from distances in
excess of 40 yards away.
Receiving nothing but praise from her teammates and
coaching staff, Katey is a model student athlete. "She sees
the field well and her constant movement throughout the
midfield opens up the attack in transition," fellow co-captain Catherine Salussolia 'O4 says.
The quintessential team player, McCaffrey is extremely modest about her on-the-field accomplishments. In
addition to her soccer achievements, however, Katey is
also a very talented (and I think very attractive) young
lady off the field, double majoring in history and biology.
I had the privilege to spend a few minutes with Katey to
find out more about what makes her tick.

Carlton Davis: So, Katey, where are you from?
I've lived in a city with a population of 137,962, located
in the prairie in Southeastern Colorado, called Pueblo
(Spanish for town) for my whole life. The Congressional

Record recognizes Pueblo as the "Home of Heroes"
because it is the home of four Congressional Medal of
Honor winners, the most of any city in the nation. In 1953,
President Eisenhower, upon presenting one of these
medals commented, "What is it... something in the water
out there in Pueblo? All you guys turn out to be heroes!"
(Editor's note: Pueblo is pronounced pweh-blo, not pwayblo.)

As an athlete, who do you look up to?
I've never been the kind of person to designate someone
as a personal hero. Who I look up to depends on the day.
When playing soccer, for instance, at every game and
every practice there is a teammate who truly amazes and
inspires me. At that moment, they are the person who I
most look up to.

If you could have dinner with three people, who would

they be?

Always a tough question
I have always been fascinated with former Secretary of State Albright. She is the
highest-ranking woman in US government history and has
had enough once-in-a-lifetime experiences to fill a million
lifetimes. I would also like to have dinner with my grandfather. He died when I was fairly young and I always hear
about what an incredible person he was. I guess the third
would be a famous comedian like Bill Cosby or Jerry
Seinfeld. I don't know, comedians always seem to have the
most interesting life experiences and philosophies.

What is your greatest athletic achievement?
Hopefully by the end of the season, I can say winning
the conference with my college soccer team.

Wharton AB 2nd.

What's a personal quote or saying that you live by?

Soccer.

I frequently ask myself before making decisions, "If
everyone did this would it be a problem?"

What is something you are best known for?
Most of my friends know that I really don't like crumbs

If you learned or acquired one thing during your semes-

ter in Ireland last year, what was it?

I learned that talking and listening to people whenever
you can (on buses, in lines, at restaurants and pubs) is the
best way to start learning how to understand and really
enjoy people.

Katey is just one of a group of fantastic women on the
team, and she is only one of many reasons to come out and

assured that it bores me, too. Nevertheless, I enjoy watching every one of the Garnet's games while learning the
finer intricacies of the sport. If our women's soccer team is
going to have a championship-caliber season, it will need
the support of each and every one of the College's students
and faculty. So check the schedule and come on down to all

What goes through your head right before a game? Do

I don't keep little trolls or candles in my gym locker or
anything, but I do have what some might call pre-game rituals. Before I ever get to the field house, I figure out how
many games I have left in my career and write it on my
hand, foot or ankle. I guess I just want to remind myself
not to take my soccer playing days for granted. I know
that they won't last forever and that one day I would probably give anything for just one more game.
Before the game starts I always make a point of taking
a quick look at the opponents' touch on the ball during
their warmup. However, I never watch them for more
than 15 seconds because I've always thought that watching another team warm up is a sign of intimidation and

Garnet take second in Classic
BY ALEX KALKSTEIN
akalkstl@swarthmore.edu

Swat volleyball showed that it is ready for a
intense season of play, bringing it up a notch every
game it plays. At this weekend's Swat Classic tournament, the Garnet showed their fire with a second place finish behind Elizabethtown, defeating
Rutgers-Camden and Cabrini College-in their pool.

Marywood and St. Joseph's also competed in this
six-team matchup.
In the first match of the tournament, Swat dominated Rutgers-Camden 3-0 (30-23, 30-20, 30-17).
Setter Emily Conlon 'O6 led Swat's assault on
Rutgers with 36 assists and four serving aces.
Patrice Berry 'O6 also helped lead Swat to success
with seven digs and an impressive team-high six

aces.

The second match of the tournament against

Cabrini College proved more of a challenge. The
match extended to five games, but the Tide were
able to pull through in the fifth to win the match 32 (30-26, 25-30, 21-30, 30-19,17-15). Co-captains Emma
Benn 'O4 and Natalie Dunphy 'O5 both made solid

Coach Harleigh Leach couldn't be more thrilled

CHEAP EATS
HOT DOG!
BY EMILY GASSER

Laura Holzman Phoenix Staff

Dork on a budget
Benjamin Masten's take
Deep in their hearts, serious eaters believe there exists
(somewhere) a hole-in the-wall Chinatown restaurant with a
massive, cheap, un-Americanized menu, impeccable service,
and food that's worth squeezing in elbow to elbow with dozens
of other customers for. It's a bit like evangelical religion, particularly because, once found, such a restaurant breeds fanat-

ical devotion amongst its patrons and a desire to convert
unbelievers, even if they aren't willing to listen.
In that spirit, if you don't go for a meal at Pho Xe Lua, a
Vietnamese place on Race Street in Philly, I don't think we
can be friends anymore. Sure, there are maybe six inches
between you and the next table, but there's a reason the place
is packed so tight and always doing a booming business. For
one thing, it's delicious. For another, it's dirt cheap. With a
few exceptions, everything on the menu is under 10 bucks,
and you can get a massive, steaming bowl of pho, the traditional Vietnamese, season-it-yourselfbeef and noodle soup for
$4.50. Believe me when I say it's a meal itself, delicately flavored, slightly sour and with a little kick after a few judicious
squirts of chili sauce. Want more, you gluttonous pig? Munch
on an equally huge appetizer like sugarcane shrimp for $2.75.
Or split a mammoth, family-style entree that go from between
five to 12 bucks. Pho Xe Lua specializes in large groups and
has upstairs rooms specifically for big dinners. Get a bunch of
friends, stuff yourselves and go home happy.
According to Sarah, if, for some reason, you happen to find
yourself on South Street in the company of your grandma,
and you don't want to walk her past Condom Kingdom, you
should take her to the Pink Rose Pastry Shop on South Fourth
Street. She also tells me that it's probably better to go with
your girlfriend or anyone who's not a big, macho, testosterone-intensive manly type. So, apparently I fit in just fine. It
is, however, a place where you can get a mouth-watering twoperson eclair the size of a shotput for $6, and split it with a
date who doesn't mind decor with lots of pink. There are plenty of smaller (but still pretty substantial) pastries and cookies
in the range of $3 and a large selection of coffee and tea.

Sarah St. Vincent's take

If you're hungry after a day of shopping on South Street
but don't want a place where the decor is reminiscent of a
birthday cake, there's no need to despair. As anyone who has
ever ventured into this tattooed tourist trap knows, South
Street is lined with cafes and restaurants, some of which are
actually pretty good. One of our favorite spots for a cheap
meal is South Street Souvlaki at the corner of sth and South.
The dishes at this popular Greek restaurant are real standouts, prepared using fresh ingredients that have obviously
been chosen with care. On this occasion, we split an excellent
appetizer ofbaba ghanouj and warm pita bread ($5); for those
wishing to stay in the $5 range, the falafel is quite good, and
the spinach pie—layers of spinach, feta cheese, and flaky phyllo dough—is a house specialty. There are plenty of vegetarian
options, including a large platter ($11) that can be shared by
two people. Our desserts—rice pudding for Ben and yogurt
with honey and toasted walnuts for me—are proof that, sometimes, simplicity really is beauty.
Speaking of beauty and simplicity, let's talk about tea. I
know.what you're thinking: "Tea is for sissies." Put down
your machismochaccino long enough to visit Great Tea
International, at 17th and Sansom, and you just might change
your mind. This Asian-style tea house is tucked away under
the Joseph Fox bookstore. Despite its subterranean location,
the owners have created a space that is airy and inviting. Pho
Xe Lua sends Ben into fits of ecstasy, but if you're looking for
a more serene atmosphere, this is the place for you. All tea is
served in loose-leaf form, and traditional Chinese tea service—a small pitcher of boiling water, a clay teapot, and two
delicate cups—is available. If you're accustomed to the world
of double espressos and don't know Iron Guan Yin or Jade
Oolong from a hole in the ground, the staff are there to help.
The sounds-of-nature CD is intrusive, but Great Tea
International is the place to go if you'd like to get off campus
but need to get work done. While enjoying iced jasmine teas,
I worked on my thesis and Ben ... well, Ben read a comic book
called "Arkham Asylum: Living Hell."

Pho Xe Lua is at

907 Race St. Open until 11 p.m. on
weekends. Closed Wednesdays.

South Street Souvlaki is at 509 South St. Take-out
available. Full bar. Closed Sundays.

Pink Rose Pastry Shop is at 630 South Fourth St.
Seating stops at 11:15 p.m on weekends. Open for

Hot dog and water: $3.75

Vietnamese pho: $4.50

We've all seen them: those shiny silver carts
on the street corners of Philly, advertising
cheesesteaks, hot dogs and other quick, hot
lunch foods. But how many people have actually
sampled their wares?
These sidewalk eateries are Philadelphia's
answer to Manhattan's pretzel stands, but with
much more variety. Each cart offers a full menu,
usually featuring cheese or chicken steaks,
sausages, hot dogs and a few types of hoagies.
And the food's not bad. On a recent trip into the
city, I tried the food at two of these carts.
For lunch that day, I had a grilled cheese sandwich from a cart just down the street from the
Ben Franklin Institute. The man running the stand
had run out of bread, but he was nice enough to
make it on a hot dog bun. The sandwich was actually pretty good, albeit slightly flat. Together with a
bottle of water, the meal came to $3. That's a
lunch I could get used to.
For dinner, I stopped at a cart in front of the
Free Library, run by a man named Muzaffer. As
my cheese steak sizzled on the grill, Muzaffer
explained what he does each day. He's spent the
last seven years working this cart, which is open
from 10 to 6 every day, though he rotates amon
several locations. Business is usually good, but
it's frustrating, he says, because "I work for someone else. It's not my business."
The steak itself lived up to the standard set by
lunch, though it was more expensive: $8 for that
and an iced tea. The meat was tasty, and the
cheese was gooey and well-melted. Greasy, yes,
but that's part of the charm of street food. If
you're looking for low-cal, go to a cafe.

The Philadelphia Museum of Art is a great
bargain for Swat students looking to indulge their
more cultural sides. Unfortunately overlooked in
this museum is its Rural Pennsylvanian and its
Pennsylvania German Collection.
Tucked away in a small corner of the
American Art wing, it is known to be one of the
most comprehensive collections of Pennsylvania
German rural decorative arts. This reporter and
her companions noted in particular the collection
of dishes. Sounds mundane? At a closer look, it
becomes anything but.
A glass cabinet spanning the length of one wall
houses nearly 70 dishes. The dishes, approximately a foot in diameter, are primarily dark,
faded yellow lead-glazed earthenware dishes with
copper and blue-green sgraffito effects. Sgraffito
(or just "graffito") is a method of decoration produced by "scratching a topcoat of plaster to reveal
an undercoat of contrasting and deeper color,"
according to
www.bartleby.com.
German
proverbs are inscribed along the rims of the
plates, while the centers of the dishes depict a
range of subjects: people, flowers, plants, birds,

The lines of the decorations are thick and

Sure, there are plenty of great restaurants, music venues and boutiques you
should explore in the Outside World; but to
really make the-SEPTA ticket worth your
while, I urge you to check out Philly's sexier
side. OK, so PhiUyJs version of a red light district may be- only a string of seedy topless
bars, but, really; there are several upscale
sex toy shops as well as clubs (both the strip
and garden variety) that will prove to be lots
of naughty fun.
The three *main sex toy stores are
Condom Kingdom, the Mood and the E Zone,
more or less in that order. If you're looking
for. a store that has leather handcuffs as well
as vibrating dildos, Condom Kingdom is the
store for you. The laid-back ambience plus
the sheer number of customers will provide
sufficient anonymity for even the most hesitant customers. (Yes, even I was nervous
once.) Even though there are a wide variety
of "serious" sex toys, there are also playful
goodies, like gummy penises and pasta, that
keep the tone light, as well as the many
groups of young women who enter giggling
:
with mock disgust.
While CK is definitely the place to go for
toys, The Mood and the E Zone specialize in
"fantasy fashion." These little numbers of
lace, vinyl and leather are actually surprisingly expensive, considering the amount of
fabric. There are really hot .costumes, such
as a nurse's or Catholic schoolgirl uniform
(yes, I know I'm going to hell).that might
make it-easier to really let yourself enjoy the
awesomeness that is role play. (I'm talking

For the women looking to. hook up with
women, I would personally advise you hot to
bring friends with you so that you don't get

about meeting someone new. Plus, as I
embarrassingly discovered once, even
though it's a gay club, many of the females
there are straight, which means that pretty
much anyone can feel comfortable there.
That is, comfortable once you get past the

Hunting for the bargain CDs
BY ROSS HOFFMAN
Say what you will about file-sharing piracy; a
undeniable contributing cause of the
record industry's supposed woes (which they're
apparently starting to do something about) is
more straightforward and overwhelming: CDs
are freaking expensive.
As a confirmed addict, I have been forced to
find my own methods for acquiring recorded
music at less than standard prices. I periodically
join, quit, and re-join record clubs such as BMG
(so so worth it for the initial deal; but don't think
about buying after that); I haunt the used-goods
'net mecca that is half.com; and of course it's
hard to beat having record companies send you
their product absolutely free. While these are all
admirable proxies, there's nothing that really
compares to the allure and joy of spending an
indulgent hour or so in a record store, emerging
dazed with a handful of reasonably-priced
records that you just couldn't live without.
Philadelphia doesn't have the fabulous newCD market of, say, Boston, and there's nothing on
the scale of San Francisco's Amoeba (basically
the world's most ideal record store), but it's perfectly possible to spend a happy day of bin browsing and return home with some worthwhile
tunes without totally depleting your funds. South
Street, of course, has the highest concentration of
record shops, the perennial favorites being
major

Spaceboy Music and Repo Records, both with
healthy used sections and bound to carry whatever you couldn't find at Tower down the street.
Recent years have seen a significant influx of
vinyl-only or -primarily shops, catering to
Philly's active DJ culture, such as 611 and Cue.
These specialize in the latest techno and hip-hop
sides, which often tend to be just as expensive or
more than new CDs elsewhere. That's not to say
that going vinyl isn't generally a highly costeffective decision: consider the treasure-filled
(though disturbingly cat-piss-smelling) backroom of the Book Trader (where I've picked up
Bowie and Ry Cooder LPs for a dollar apiece), or
the 99-cent 12" bins outside of Armand's on
Chestnut, where you'll find all of last month's
club smashes.
Probably the best Philly has to offer, however
(given the unfortunate demise of relative newcomers Dot-Dash in Northern Liberties and
World Pary Music in Media), is a bit of a trek
from South Street, but just ten short blocks from
Market East station: aka music, on Second Street
just north of Market, has the city's best used CD
selection (prices generally fall between $5 and $9,

Makeup without the markup

Good clothing for less cash

Cosmetic Bargains, a cheap route for great products

BY CAROLINE CELANO

BY BRANDY MONK-PAYTON
On a Saturday afternoon I strolled, as
Bruce Springsteen puts it, “The Streets of
Philadelphia.” “I walked the avenue till my
legs felt like stone”... or basically until there
was another shopping center in sight, in
which case my legs miraculously carried me
into the various stores to spend money that I
didn’t necessarily have. But that was okay
because I found one answer to college students’ problems with a lack of cash, from a
female’s perspective.
Cosmetics. It can be trying at times, going

to countless department stores looking for
just the right makeup at the right price.
Sometimes I can’t purchase S4O Clinique or
MAC products without cringing at how much
I’m spending for just a smidgen of lipstick or
eyeshadow. Lo and behold, there is a solution, and it is called Cosmetic Bargains,

located on Walnut Street near Rittenhouse
Square. At first glance the store may exude a
‘cheap prices for cheap products’ mentality.
But that’s hardly the case. Once inside,

shelves are filled with different products

that, surprisingly, aren’t generic! The store
just happens to sell Lancome, Elizabeth
Arden and other lines of beauty regime items

at lower prices. The store has a decent selection of cosmetic bags as well as nail polish
that is definitely in my price range.
Cosmetic Bargains is not limited to just
makeup. The store also sells many different
creams, lotions and soaps: Select scented

searching for a present for a friend or relative? Cosmetic Bargains also has gift bags
that have an assortment of supplies for daily
usage. If your dorm room reeks from an
unidentified smell, try buying a gel fragrancer from the Picket Fence Collection,
which come in many scents such as Country
Meadow. These small candle-like jars are
ideal for setting on top of a bookcase or desk.
This item costs a cheap $3.50. The store also
carries hair care products like brushes,
combs, and shampoo. Bath products fill the
shelves as well, with Bath Mates, perfect for
children, and sponges with handles, helpful
in washing those hard-to-reach areas on the
back while in the shower.
The variety of products in Cosmetic
Bargains (or as I like to call it, Bath and Body
Works for the practical woman), is extremely
refreshing and especially coupled with cheap
prices and friendly employees. A must visit!

Luckily, I have a really nasty one that

has made me the darling of the Gays of
New York. Unfortunately, my attitude
causes me problems in stores of which
I'm not a fan, mainly cheap ones.
So I, dressed to kill, armed with 100
bucks and two fabulous freshmen, went

on a mission to South Street in search of
the Holy Grail cheap, nice clothing
with a trusty Spade in hand.
First stop: Retrospect, which, in retrospect, was a gigantic waste of time. It's
a funky-esque thrift store that holds
more sequined items than Liberace's
closet. Think lots of shoulder pads and
dresses a la "Dynasty." Retrospect also
had the ingredients for Jim's prom tux in
"American Pie," and had a wide array of
-shirts for up to $l2.
Our troops forged on and were blinded by the sign on the door and the Dolce
and Gabbana in the window of the neighboring store, Platinum. I know you're
thinking: is this cheap? Not really, but it
does carry designers such as Versace,
Diesel, D&G and 7 for all Mankind.
Attitude in full force, one fabulous frosh
was fully able to talk the salespeople into
giving him the Diesels which were $l5B
for $9B.
Now, no good outfit would be complete without accessories. We stumbled
upon a tiny sunglass store, fully confident after that steal at Platinum. There,
at Magnific, a freshman fell in love. A

divine light shone from these beauteous

clear Christian Dior sunglasses; it was a
match made in eyewear heaven. And

before the freshman darling could even
try them on, the salesman had the case

Used David Bowie CD: $lOO Gel fragrancer: $3.50 Vintage shirt: $12.00

and bag ready. Marked down from $225,
they were a steal at $95. The best part?
The enamored buyer was able to get said
salesman to give her 20 percent off the
next time she went there. Find out who
she is, and use her discount.
I was quite jealous of these fabulous
finds and upset that I had not been able
to tell the average Swattie where to find
clothes. Then I ran into two cheap, butfunky, stores for the average student.
Tiger Lily has fabulous party clothes in
bright, fun colors. You can buy a top and
bottom for about $4O that is of higher
quality and in more flattering cuts than
H & M. These are important in one's
quest for the elusive attractive mate.
Flattering cuts mean a flattering figure.
Flattering figures lead to a search for
flattering bedroom lighting.
If you're less Christina Aguilera and
more Avril Lavigne, then head to
Guacamole, boys and girls. Displaying
punk-inspired treasures (think Vivienne
Westwood meets the Sex Pistols),
Guacamole has everything from t-shirts
and jeans to hip sneakers and knock-off

Louis Vuitton Murakami bags. But don't
wear a tie with a wife beater and plaid
pants. It's been done.
Weary, we trudged on and I finally
saw a store that caught my eye: Europe
Moda. I shrieked with glee, stumbling
upon designers like Moschino, Ferre and
Armani, while happy to see more reasonable labels such as BCBG. I found a
pair of Gucci loafers for $220 (they run at
450, kids) and for $5O some fabulous tops
by Versace and Ferre (I won't even tell
you where that starts). And then a denim
Miss Sixty skirt spoke to me. Costing a
mere $7O, I ran to the cash register and
emptied my

wallet.

We decided to give something back to the
city of Philadelphia by offering a much-needed service to its underprivileged citizens. We
know that there are already many outstanding local groups that work to feed, clothe and
shelter homeless people, so we decided to
think outside the boxcar. One important question immediately popped into our heads: How
does the modern hobo on the go get around?
And so the Hobo Trolley was born. We
decided to drive into Philadelphia with all the
necessary provisions for hobo transportation
and offer free rides to the noble hobos on the

Hobo Trolley™.
That's our trademark.
"Vagrant Van" and "Bum Bus" are both
available, to the best of our knowledge.
Don't make us get stabby.
Despite all our preparations, the trial run
of the Hobo Trolley™ met with only moderate
success. As it turns out, a hobo in need of a
ride is harder to find than Jon and Emiliano's
testicles. We drove around, shouting out the
windows such things as, "Hobo Trolley™!",

First things first, we had to prepare our
mode of transport, the "trolley." When Bill
Cosby got his first car, he painted "Captain
America" on the side. Gerrit therefore felt it
would be appropriate to decorate Mac's car in
a similar vein, only replacing "Captain" with
"Hobo" and "America" with "Trolley." Mac
muttered something about over his dead
something or other, and we eventually

reached a compromise whereby we taped
signs to the windows.

Getting lost in Philly
Six lessons for turning confusion into an adventure
BY EMILY GASSER
If you're planning on visiting
Philadelphia, make sure you have one
of three things with you: a map, some
*idea of where you want to go and how
to get there, or, failing that, at least a
healthy sense of adventure. Even if you

>

have no idea where you are or where
you're going, it's surprisingly hard to
get really and truly lost; Philly is an
extraordinarily well-labeled city. Case
in point:
About two weeks ago, a friend of
mine from upstate New York came to
visit for the weekend. We decided to
head into town to see the Jazz and
Poetry Festival taking place in the general vicinity of the Museum of Art. I'd
been into Philly exactly once before,
and this was Ryan's first-ever visit. Of
course, neither of us had thought to
bring a map. "It's a big museum," we
thought. "How hard could it be?"
Well. The conductor on the train
told us to get off at Suburban Station.
Lesson one: Train conductors are real-

ly nice and know what they're talking

about. Use them.
We disembarked at our stop and
looked around. No museum. But, lo and
behold, there were signs on all the corners, giving directions to every possible tourist attraction in the area.
Lesson two: Watch for signs. They're

there.
After a good 20 minutes of walking,
backtracking and an awful lot of stairclimbing, we made it to the museum.

jazz festival,
however, was
nowhere to be seen. Damn. The point of
this issue is cheap things to do, and
museums are definitely not cheap. So

The

passengers who boarded the trolley. As everyone knows, the centerpieces of hobo culture
are baked beans and Night Train-fortified
wine. Unfortunately, neither of us could
afford the $5 that these things would cost. So
we grabbed a peppermint stuck between
Gerrit's couch.cushions and hit the road.
Before you go out and make your own imitation Hobo Trolley, we must warn you about
a number of security issues. The most dangerous thing about hobos is their bad breath,
so we were lucky to have a peppermint at
hand. Also, while most hobos are good-hearted streef-dwellers, you might occasionally
run across the so-called "stabby" variety of
hobo.
For this reason, we recommend that you

clippers.
A final word of caution: We had better not

"Free rides for hobos!", "Now boarding!", and
"Hey, hobo!" But, rather than taking us up on
our generous offer of a free ride (and a mint),
the hobos spurned us. Some acted as if they
couldn't hear us, others stared quizzically, but
no one even feigned interest in our civicmindedness.
Hobos of every shape and size rejected us:
tall hobos, short hobos, graduate school
hobos, unemployed hobos, attractive female
hobos, hobos in business suits, mother hobos
with baby hobos
We thought at first that no
one needed a ride, but then we saw scores of
hobos waiting for buses or stepping into taxis.
What could all these hobos have against the
Hobo Trolley™?
A bit dismayed, we headed back to
Swarthmore. Mac decided that the mint
would be put to its best use in Gerrit's mouth.
We were about to give up all hope when we
realized that there might be needy hobos in
our own backyard. At that very moment, we
spotted Toby David 'O6 sitting dejectedly in
the parking lot. "Hey, hobo!" we shouted.
"Need a ride?"
"Urn
not really," Toby said, as we threw
him in the back seat of the Trolley™ and carted him off to the Springfield Mall.
Leaving Toby in the parking lot and driving away, we watched in admiration as he ran
excitedly after us, and we congratulated ourselves on another job well done.
...

...

we moved on.
"If we can't see the museum, let's go

see the Liberty Bell! Look, there's a
sign. It must be nearby, right?" Naive

tourists that we were, we retraced our
steps back toward the center of town
and followed the arrows towards the

Liberty Bell. And followed them. And
followed them. Lesson three: The signs
tell you that an attraction is "that' way".
They do not tell you how far that way.
Beware.

Many, many blocks later, we arrived
at the Liberty Visitors' Center. We got

on the line advertising free tickets to
just in time for them to
Liberty Hall
run out of tickets and close for the day.
Lesson four: Liberty Hall is great. Get

there early.
Still, there was the bell, which had a
line reaching completely around the
block. Lesson Five: It's a bell with a
crack down the side. Get over it.
So hungry, footsore and utterly
exhausted, we trudged back to the visitors' center with one thought in our
minds: "Where's the nearest train station?" Lesson six: Like train conductors, the people who work in
visitors' centers are underappreciated
resources. Once again, use them.
Quite a few more blocks and 45 min-

utes later, we were finally back on campus. It might not have been the most
exciting trip ever, but, hey, it was cheap.
