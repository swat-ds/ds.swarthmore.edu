By

Phoenix Staff

Peter Kostmayer, executive

director of the Washington
D-C.-based nonprofit organiza-

tion Zero Population Growth,
spoke at Swarthmore Tuesday

during a visit sponsored by

Earthlust. Although, as
Kostmayer said, the name of
his organization often scares
and misleads people, the man
himself had no such effect,
charming the intimate audi-

ence with both humor and honesty.
In one anecdote, Kostmayer
explained the problems with
the name Zero Population
Growth (ZPG). "Sometimes
I'm on the radio and people will
call up and say, 'Zero population. Well, you're for no people.'
That's
not
our view,"
Kostmayer said. "I am an advocate of us changing our
name. It's hard to find a name
that really says what we do."
It may be difficult to find a

name that encapsulates ZPG's
mission, but Kostmayer articulated it clearly and succinctly
in the hour-long discussion that
was mainly a question-and-answer session. "ZPG's underlying objective is to deal with
problems caused by human

population growth,"Kostmayer
said. The recent population explosion is the most serious crisis threatening the environment, he explained.

See KOSTMAYER, pg. 6

Controversy surrounds the
visit of homosexual-turnedstraight minister Richard Yates,
who will speak on homosexuality
and Christianity at today's meeting of the Swarthmore Christian
Fellowship at 10 p.m. in Bond. After receiving an e-mail announcement of the event earlier this
week, members of the
Swarthmore Queer Union have
been contemplating a number of
reactions to a visit that many find
personally offensive.
"We want to let SCF know that
we're very upset and that we
think this is inappropriate," said
SQU member Julie Russo 'Ol.
Members of SQU and the QueerStraight Alliance, who have also
become involved in the debate,
hold varying opinions as to how
they should respond to Yates'
visit. At an open SQU meeting
last night, they discussed how to
demonstrate their disapproval in
a unified manner.
Yates is a representative of
Harvest USA, "a Christian ministry that reaches out to individuals struggling withpornography,
sexual addictions and/or homosexuality," according to the Philadelphia-based organization's
website. Promotional materials
for the organization advertise its
support group services "for
those seeking freedom from homosexuality."
Harvest's stance alarms many
members of both SQU and QSA,
who began an e-mail discussion
questioning the intent of the visit.
Yates is "a representative of an
organization that thinks homosexuality should not exist, so
that's why I feel somewhat
threatened," said Tim StewartWinter 'Ol, who participated in
the discussion.
"I know a lot of members of
SQU find Harvest offensive,"
said SCF president Ben Park 'O2.
Park hopes that SQU members
will consider the visit in the spirit
of open dialogue.
Though some members of the
queer and queer-friendly community favor staging a disruptive protest, other members support dialogue. Unlike StewartWinter, Corey Datz-Greenberg
'OO does not feel threatened by
the talk because of the queerfriendliness that dominates the
Swarthmore campus. He suggested, "Let's show confidence in
the strength of our community
here, confidence which I think is
completely appropriate, and re-

spectfully disagree tomorrow
night. While our presence will be
important...our hostility is not."
Park invited Yates to speak after a member of a SCF focus
group expressed interest in hearing an outside Christian perspective on homosexuality. Although
SCF meetings are open to the
campus, Park originally expected that the talk would be
given to a smallaudience consisting mostly of SCF members. The
talk was intended "mostly for
people who were interested in
hearing [Yates'] perspective,"
Park said.
SQU was informed of Yates'
visit in an e-mail fflom-William
Tran 'O3, who had heard about the
event from a friend. Park had not
planned to publicize the event
because this type of SCF meeting is not normally publicized,
but he did not object to the e-mail
announcement.

Although Park organized the
meeting for people curious about
Yates' view on homosexuality,
some members of SQU feel that
view should not be voiced on
campus. In response to the free
speech argument lodged in support of the talk, Russo answered
that Yates' message constitutes
hate speech, which is not protected by the First Amendment.
"To say that gay people shouldn't
be allowed to exist is hate speech
and that's the position of [Harvest]," she said.
Whether or not they support
Yates' right to speak on campus,
many queer activists expressed
frustration that his will be the
only voice heard about homosexuality and the gospel.
Stewart-Winter, who is upset by
Yates' visit, said that he would
feel differently if Yates were one
of a series of speakers to discuss
the topic. According to Park, SCF
currently has no plans to sponsor such a series of talks but is
open to the possibility.
Park responded to the criticism of the queer community by
explaining that the event was intended not to convert homosexuals but to promote dialogue. "I
thinkthe ultimate goal of this was
misinterpreted," he said.
Rodney Morris 'Ol, who describes himself as "a friend and
ally to both the Christian and
queer communities," asked the
queer community in an e-mail not
to jump to conclusions. "I plead
that we give SCF the chance to
handle the situation as they see
fit...Maybe they'll cancel it. And
if they don't, they may be just as
interested in deconstructing this
man as we are."

NEWS BRIEF

4 cited for underage drinking
Four individuals were cited for
underage drinking on Friday,
Feb. 18 in an apartment at the 400
block of Dartmouth Ave. At least
three of the four have been identified as Swarthmore students.
According to Swarthmore Police Chief Brian Craig, the incident was sparked after a 911 call
at about 11:15 p.m. on Friday
night complaining of a loud radio. Borough police responded to
the call, knocking on the door of
the Dartmouth Ave. apartment.
Craig explained that after announcing "Come in," and then
discovering the door was locked,
one of the inhabitants came to

answer the door. Upon opening it,
three of the underage drinkers
attempted to flee through a back
exit, but halted after they after a
borough officer told themto stop.
The officer found a variety of
beer cans and bottles, some
empty, some unopened. After the
officer rummaged through the
trash and got a firm count of the
alcoholic beverages, he confiscated the remaining alcohol and
cited the four for underage
drinking. They were not hauled
in to the police station.
Craig explained that each of
the violators was a first-time offenderand that none will see the
misdemeanor blemish on their
record as long as they complete
a community service program.
Rumor had placed the bust in
Roberts dormitory, but while
Craig said that some of the students may have been from Roberts, he had no recollection of oncampus citations and would have
clearly remembered such an
event. He stressed that borough
policy is driven primarily by a
"realistic concern for the safety
of the students," and that "the
department is not on a campaign
[to bust Swarthmore students.]"

Student Council unanimously approved a plan
Tuesday night that will raise the Student Activities Fee to $257 next year. It is an increase of
over 13 percent compared to the fee's current
level of $226. Next year, the fee will rise by an
additional $2O plus the rate of inflation.
The fee supplies virtually all of the income
for student groups and Social Affairs Committee-funded events, as well as money for replacing student-owned equipment. After purchases
of new studio equipment for WSRN, two new
vans and additional sound system equipment,
the capital replacement account has been depleted to a level of about $30,000. This is down
from nearly $lOO,OOO several years ago, according to Laura Farra 'Ol, Student Budget Committee treasurer. With student-owned equipment
worth nearly $300,000 and replacements budgeted for every fifth year, SBC members said
the increase was necessary to replenish the capital replacement account.
But despite the significant increase in the fee,
it does not contain any additionalallocations to
student groups. Few students interviewed by the
committee during tabling at Sharpies supported
a proposal to raise the SAF by more than $45
over two years to increase allocations to groups
as well. The committee is thus planning to cap
spending for future years at this year's level.
In other business from Tuesday night's meeting, Student Council continued to consider the
issue of parking on campus.
Outreach chair Neil Cavanaugh 'O3 said that,
during tabling at Sharpies, 60 students were in
favor of increasing the number of college-allocated parking spots by renting 30 spaces from
the lot in the Ville. Only 15students opposed that.
Currently, about 60 students who were denied
parking spaces by the Student Council parking
committee rent spaces on their own at $2O a
month. The plan would charge all students with
on-campus spaces about $4O per year to rent the
additional 30 off-campus spaces.
Co-chair Brandon Silverman 'O2 reported that
of the e-mails he had received on the issue from
students, 29 were in favor of the change and six
were opposed. Students recommended in their
e-mails that the parking committee process be

improved, he said, and others advocated that the
council ask the college to pay for part of the cost
of the additional 30 spaces.
The council is also investigating obtaining additional parking spaces in the Cunningham lot.
Facilities and space coordinatorWill Ortman 'O2
said he counted empty spaces in the lot each day
last week and on most days there were 15 to 19
empty spaces.
Co-chair JordanBrackett 'Ol noted that while
students were overwhelmingly in favor of paying $2O per semester for parking if it would
mean more spaces, he also got other feedback.
"The other negative comments that I got, and
I'm starting to see the validity of them, is that it
isn't really creating more spots," he said. "It's
just a money transfer from people who are paying $2OO a year."
Brackett said the council should push to obtain more parking spaces in the Cunningham lot
as well as investigating other ways to get additional parking spaces off-campus.
But Silverman said the real issue with student
parking was how some students with a legitimate need for spots were not assigned any and
how the assignment did not take place until after this academic year started. "The most important thing right now is fixing how Parking
Committee gives out the spots," he said.

Native American group forming
By Marina Boevska
Phoenix Staff
A Native American support group may soon appear on campus. The idea is still in the initial stage,
but Stacey Wagaman 'Ol is determined to fill this
gap in an otherwise minority-friendly campus.
The purpose of the new cultural group will be to
facilitate discussion of Native American issues. If
formed, it will both raise awareness on campusand
serve as a support group. The group would plan to
advocate increasing the number of students and
members of faculty with a Native American background. The support group is also considering inviting to campus speakers who would address Native American issues.
So far, only one meeting of the new support group
has been held. According to Wagaman, it was aimed
at raising students' consciousness. There are still
many organizational decisions to be made and the
charter of the group has not yet been written.
It remains unclear whether or not the new group
will be a part of the Intercultural Center. Wagaman
has contacted Anna Maria Cobo, director of the IC,
but, according to Wagaman, "it is too early to tell"
whether the Native American group will be under
the IC umbrella.

Swarthmore has many support groups for students of different ethnic backgrounds (HOLA,
SASS, SAO, SOCA). However, no such Native
American group exists.
In addition, the academic curriculum of
Swarthmore overlooks Native American culture in
comparison to other cultures. The college offers
concentrations in different cultural studies (German, Latin American, etc.,) but the course catalogue shows a clear deficiency of courses on Native American culture. The only courses that address Native American culture are taught by
Michelle Hermann of the English department, who
is not a permanent faculty member.
Although Native Americans represent less than
1 percent of the U.S. population and less than 1 percent of the student body, Swarthmore has been very
active in recruiting such students. The college encourages Native Americans to participate in activities for minority students such as minority prefrosh weekend and diversity summer retreats.
Wagaman argues that, since the college recognizes the importance of Native American students
for diversity, it should provide them with a support group and a network to serve their needs. She
adds that Swarthmore has a responsibility to "foster a more diverse community on campus."

Colorado State subpoenaed in MP3 crackdown
By Holli Mast
Rocky Mountain Collegian
(U-WIRE) FORT COLLINS,
Colo. Colorado State University
was handed a subpoena early last
week by the Record Industry
Association of America in conjunction with its investigation of
a CSU student who was allegedly
using a Web site to illegally obtain and distribute digital music
files.
The RIAA, which investigates
Web sites it suspects to be operating in violation of copyright
laws, requested the student's
-

identification from the university Feb. 15; CSU complied. Also,
stored
the student's Web site
and
on a university server
Internet connection were terminated, said CSUPD officer Mark
Childress.
The student being investigated, who spoke with the Collegian on the condition of anonymity, said he was not aware of the
full scope of computer crime.
"You're young enough to download MP3s and not know it's illegal, yet you can go to prison for
it," he said. "It's like fireworks:
You can buy them, but you can't

set them off."

MP3 is a format by which digital sound can be compressed and
stored.
MP3-encoded sound is available over the Internet from sites
such as Napster.com or
MP3.com, and can be downloaded to any computer for free.
The current case is the second
involving an RIAA investigation
of illegal MP3 distribution sites
operating out of CSU residence
halls, Childress said. However,
this case was the first in which
the university had been subpoenaed, he said.

Candles and incense, once sold in the bookstore, have now been removed.

College moves to clarify
policies on fire safety
By Rachel Labush
Phoenix Staff
In the wake of the Seton Hall

fire, the deans and the Housing

Committee moved last week to
ban the sale of hazardous substances from the bookstore and
toughen other aspects of college
fire policy, including smoking
regulations.
In late January, a residence
hall fire at Seton Hall University
in New Jersey that resulted in the
deaths of three students raised
concern at Swarthmore about
fire safety. In response to this
concern, the Housing Committee
decided to increase the number
of non-smoking halls and enforce
smoking rules more strictly and
to conduct inspections of dorm
rooms for forbidden items such
as halogen lamps. In addition, it
ordered the bookstore to stop
selling candles and incense.
According to Myrt Westphal,
director of residential life, smoking is the second most common
cause of residence hall fires next
to arson and vandalism. Currently, smoking in dorm rooms is
allowed in Hallowell, parts of
Mary Lyon, Mertz Ist, Pittenger
3rd, Wharton E/F and C/D Ist,
Willets, Worth and the Lodges.
Smoking is not allowed in other
dorm rooms and is forbidden in
other indoor spaces on campus.
The Housing Committee
agreed to make all of Mary
Lyons, Pittenger and Worth nonsmoking next year but rejected
a blanket prohibition on smoking
in dorm rooms because it might
lead to smokers secretly smoking all over campus instead of on
only a few halls.
Wharton C/D Ist is an illustration of the confusion and apathy
that accompanies the designation
of smoking and non-smoking
halls. According to Westphal, it
is a smoking hall, but the hallRA,
Tracy McNeill 'OO, said she was
under the impression that all of
Wharton C/D was non-smoking.
There are two or three smokers
on the hall, but they all smoke
outside. One of them, a junior,
said that she did not think she
was allowed to smoke in her
room, but that even if she were,
she probably would gooutside in
consideration of her hallmates.
Across the hall, Amber Adamson

'Ol said she and her roommate,
like most non-smokers, did not
consider whether the hall permitted smoking when choosing their
room. To clarify smoking policies, the Housing Committee decided to make the designation of
non-smoking rooms more prominent in the housing booklet and
in the room lottery.
Use of other fire hazards is
under attack as well. At the meeting, student members of the
Housing Committee clashed with
the administration over how to
enforce the ban on candles, incense, and halogen lamps in residence halls. They agreed that if
a maintenance worker is in a student room for any reason, he or
she may leave a note calling attention to candles or incense, and
if the items remain during a second inspection, they may be confiscated. Students on the committee did not, however, condone the
confiscation of halogen lamps,
warning Westphal that student
outcry would not permit the
implementation of such a policy.
"Everybody I know has a halogen lamp," says Christopher
Woodrell 'Ol, who does not have
one himself. One member of the
Housing Committee pointed out
that banning halogen lamps in
rooms where smoking is allowed
is inconsistent.
In an attempt to eradicate the
use of candles and incense, Vice
President of Facilities Larry
Schall decided along with the
deans to ban those items for sale
from the bookstore. Although
both candles and incense sold
well at the bookstore, the deans
felt selling them was "sending
mixed signals," said Kathy
Grace, bookstore director. Grace
says that the bookstore already
has signs next to the candles and
incense reminding students of
the college's prohibition on open
flames in dorm rooms.
The Seton Hall fire has rendered such precautions insufficient. Westphal is sympathetic to
student concerns, but cites safety
as the most important concern.
"Fire safety is something that we
all participate in and all care
about," said Westphal. "Not allowing candles or high-burning
halogen lamps in the rooms is because we care about the safety
of all students."

Kostmayer, population expert, visits campus
From KOSTMAYER, pg. 3
While it took from the beginning of human existence until the nineteenth century to reach a population of one billion,
only two hundred years later, the population stands at six billion. In the worst case
scenario, Kostmayer said, analysts predict
that the population will double to 12 billion by 2050. "That is 168 new people every minute, another New York City every
33 days, or another Mexico every 12
months," Kostmayer emphasized.
To tackle the disastrous effects of this
fantastic rate of growth, ZPG has adopted
the two-pronged approach of reducing
both population growth and consumption
levels. The first tactic focuses on achieving zero population growth, a term that
describes a population that has been maintained at replacement rate growth (two
children per couple) for 70 years. Certain

A current project of ZPG is lobbying for
health insurance coverage of contraception. Most plans in the U.S. do not cover
all five FDA-approved contraceptive
methods; only half cover any option at all.
Title 10 provides free family planning for
poor women, but due to lack of funding,
only half of the women who need
contraception receive it.
In two events, ZPG will lobby in support
of legislation requiring health insurance
plans that cover prescription drugs to
cover prescription contraceptives.

countries (notably in Europe) have
reached zero population growth; Japan
and Italy even have negative population
growth. The rate of growth in the U.S. still
hovers at just over replacement rate.
Linking all of these nations with low
rates of growth is the high access to family planning, education and economic opportunity they provide for women. "It's
not about telling people what to do,"
Kostmayer said. "It's not necessary, in fact
it's repugnant, to do, for example, what the
Chinese government is doing, which is
imposing a policy called the one-child-perfamily policy." Kostmayer does not endorse what he called dogmatic approaches

can obtain similar results through educating and providing family planning to
women and then allowing them to decide
the size of their families. "We don't have
to badger people," he stressed.
While the first prong targets developing countries, the second focuses on the
high consumption levels of industrialized
nations such as the U.S. Although population growth may have slowed in these
countries, resource depletion has soared,
resulting in grave environmental impacts.
"Americans use more stuffthan anyone,"
Kostmayer said.
This aspect of the population problem
is more complicated and more difficult to
solve than the numbers explosion. As
Kostmayer explained, "People freely
choose to have smaller families, but they
don't freely choose to use less."
ZPG, founded in 1968, is not a service
organization, Kostmayer said, highlighting its differences from providers such
as Planned Parenthood. It instead attempts to change policy through activism
and education; as Kostmayer put it, ZPG
organizes people. To assist voters, ZPG,
while not allowed to endorse candidates,
provides report cards for politicians grading their commitment to the environment,
family planning, and other such issues.
Asked about the upcoming presidential
election, Kostmayer applauded Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley for their

Phoenix Staff
Most students received an e-mail
this week announcing a new Web site
for the Swarthmore community:
www.swarthmorecollege.com. The
site, created by alumnus John
Schmeling '7B, offers a message
board, chat room, classifieds, an
alumni directory and resume and
employment services.
The Web site's mission, as stated
on its home page, is "to serve as a
communication forum for the
Swarthmore community the ultimate resource for students and alums to meet, network, chat and exchange ideas and information." The
site employs considerable web technology to bring resume and job
search services, but is still lacking
in content, which must be largely
user generated. Only three students
thus far have submitted classified
ads in search of employment, and
the chat room and web directory
content is equally paltry.
The site is part of a two-school
network
called
Alumnet
(www.alumnet.net) that was founded
by Charlotte's Web Studios, a media
design company that Schmeling
partly owns. A posting on the message board questioned the intent of
this site and other commercial manifestations of college domain names.
While the site does not run outside
advertisements, there is a large advertisement for Charlotte's Web Studios on the home page.

Peter Kostmayer spoke Tuesday afternoon.
John McCain, he said, "It's difficult to believe that people have such bad records."
The political sphere has been
Kostmayer's life-long passion. Kostmayer

when he won the closely contested Bucks
County, Pa. election, becoming the first
Democratic representative from the area
sincethe Depression. He remained in Congress until 1992, when he accepted a job
as a regional director for the EnvironmentalProtection Agency. In 1996, he leftthis
job to become executive director of ZPG.
Although no longer officially a politician, Kostmayer continues to find himself
embroiled in the political world. "A big
part of this is politics," he said. Another
part is engaging the interest and energy
of the American populace: "We're constantly trying to find ways to get people
to care about these problems."

Sensible precautions
It is amazingly easy here to slip into a "Swarthmore

bubble" and go for days without hearing of current

events, weeks without getting off campus or even
years without having any of your property stolen. But
recent thefts are a reminder much like the rude
rush of awakening when you set foot in Philadelphia
for the first time in a month that Swarthmore is still
part of the world around us. Although almost every
aspect of Swarthmore can conspire to create the
pyschological pressure to believe in the bubble, theft is
one thing out of the bubble's control.

Until you have had something stolen, though, the
bubble mentality is so strong that any rumors of the
outside phenomenon of theft seem incongruous. They

a nuisance at
get dismissed like bad Sharpies food
the time but irrelevant to the rest of your life.
That so many of the reported thefts at Swarthmore
are classified by Public Safety as nonforcible is
evidence that students take risks here that in the "real"
world, common sense would tell them to avoid. It is
difficult not to leave your door unlocked while you're
taking a shower and a nuisance to take your bookbag
down into Sharpies instead of stashing it at the
coatrack upstairs. That thefts rarely occur under those
circumstances reinforces the idea of the bubble, but
that doesn't mean thefts cannot occur.
Director of Public Safety Owen Redgrave is right to
point out that virtually anywhere else in the world
students would not leave a wallet unattended and
expect that it would still be there later. Off campus,
you don't necessarily need to have experienced a theft
to apply this bit of common sense. Here at Swarthmore, a lack of observed theft and a sense of security
can lead us to violate that.
Although the Housing Committee is not pursuing the
issue for now, the college will undoubtedly eventually
buy a swipe-card access system for dorms that would
eliminate the need for door propping and the ability of
strangers to enter college property so easily. But no
amount of technology can correct for some complacent
habits, so in the meantime Swatties would do well to
take more precautions with their valuables.

Improving fire safety
It is difficult to react negatively to the college's proactive clarification of fire safety policy. The removal of
candles and incense from the bookstore sends an unambiguous message to students, at least on the surface. But
dig a little deeper and the blatant disregard for fire safety
overshadows any bookstore policy. If the college's concern
for students' safety is more than skin-deep, then enforcement of policy and improvements in infrastructure need
to be the two true effectors of change.
Although Swarthmore likes to treat its students as
adults, even adults are subject to enforcement. Banned
items such as incense and candles could be eliminated
with enforcementand penalties, and students would have
little justification to complain or react. Enforcement
would be sufficient if open flames and toasters were the
only fire hazards, but halogen lamps, the most pervasive
fire hazard on campus, require a different type of
change. While Swatties may not need the luxury of gentle
candlelight, they do need adequate light to study by.
Changes in lighting are only one facet of necessary
infrastructural improvements. More functional alarms,
fire walls and doors and sprinkler systems are essential
to containing a fire. Arson and vandalism are the most
common causes of fire, and these types of improvements
are the best line of defense against random crimes.
To truly make fire safety improvements, the dynamic between students and administration must
gradually shift away from a nebulous and ineffectual
education policy, and the college must show that it is
doing its part through infrastructual changes. While
the latter takes only money and initiative, the former
takes some serious rethinking of college-student
relations. We never said it would be easy.

LETTERTOTHE EDITOR

Women outside of science overlooked
To the Editor:
I would like to congratulate The Phoenix for tackling the issue of women in science at Swarthmore (Cover
Story, Feb. 24). I was, however, disappointed to see that no non-science majors were interviewed.This obviously
biases the interviews away from any women who are dissatisfied with the sciences at Swarthmore.

The unique
multiracial
experience
You know, for a melting pot country, we
sure are nervous when the melting actually takes place.
Bi- or multiracial people have an odd
status in our country. We are quick to be
labeled whatever non-white ethnicity we
contain within us, and even if our mix is
non-white/non-white, it still involves a
whole hierarchy of labeling that ends up
with a person having a singular racial or
ethnic identity in the eyes of others.
Growing up multiracial is a unique experience. As children, we all feel the need
to identify. Boys and girls, rich and poor,
black and white. In similarity, we find
strength. As the only student of any other
ethnicity at an all-black grade school, I
wasn't black enough, yet at another more
diverse grade school, I wasn't white
enough. Some of us can "pass" for something else. Others of us are somewhere in
the middle, with features from many diverse backgrounds that may not clearly
be anything.
Why is this so bad? We live in a country
where that childhood impetus of strength
in togetherness pervades our identity of
self evenas adults. There are always black
things that others wouldn't understand,
women things that men don't understand,
and so on. A niche is carved out for us in
labeling, one that, while limiting, is also
comforting in its ability to give a sense of
solidarity. There are others like us. People
who feel the same pain, the same frustration that we do. By doing this to multiracial people, however, it disregards a part
of our persona that is invaluable to us
the fact that we are not any one race or
—

ethnicity.
Swarthmore is not immune from this
syndrome. Karima Wilson's article in The
Phoenix on Feb. 17 pointed out this painful fact. I, and many others, were added
to the SASS mailing list at the beginning
of the year, despite the fact that we do not
label ourselves as "black." I am not at all
ashamed of being part black, yet I am not
happy that it was the first label applied to

me.
Simply going by percentages, most
multiracial people are not what you think
they are. I am part Native American, part
black, and more white than anything else.
Yet, I was brought up to be a black man,
gained my identity as the black male in
the midst of white people, and, most importantly, am treated as a black male by
most people that I meet. Is it so odd that I
would want to step out of that box? Forms
treat me as a black person unless I mark
"other," in which case I could be multiracial, Aleutian, or an Aborigine.
We need to look at the way we regard
race and ethnicity both here and in the
outside world. The celebration of diversity should not be a confinement of characteristics to one easily definable category, but rather a recognition of diversity both within a society and within a
person.

Phoenix wrong to advocate SAF raise
MIMI HANAQKA

cjjpis
fools

"Indefensible garbage" is the only way

to describe last week's Phoenix staff editorial titled "Raise the SAF Fee." I want
to caution the administration that the opin-

ions expressed in that staff editorial reflect neither the opinion of the student
body nor of the Student Budge Committee that has been responsible for researching the various ways in which to raise the
Student Activities Fund fee. Heeding the
editorial staff's reckless and astonishingly
poorly argued advice would burden the
students with yet more tuition while also
reflecting poorly on the College.
While I am a member of the Student
Budge Committee, I am not speaking for
the committee I am lashing out at The
Phoenix editors because I feel they have
misrepresented the facts to the student
body and to the readership of The Phoenix, a flagrant abuse of their privileged
position as editors, and because they are
fundamentally misguided.
There is a good reason why SBC recom-

mended to the Student Council that the SAF
(currently $226) be raised by $45, neither
more nor less, over the course of a twoyear period. The rationale was that an increase in the fee is necessary to restore
the severely depleted capital replacement
account, which is used to purchase large
ticket items such as new vans, equipment
for WSRN, and sound equipment used at
parties. The capital replacement account,
currently at an anemic level under $29,000,
was over $lOO,OOO a few years ago. SBC
calculated that the $45 raise would restore
about $150,000 to the account over the next
four years.
Of 224 students who filled out an SBC
survey about the SAF in Sharpies, only a
meager 14 supported the plan that The
Phoenix editorial board is advocating
clearly, it is either the case that The Phoenix has its own agenda or that its editorial
board is disastrously out of touch with the
rest of the student body.
Furthermore, the staff editorial last
week read, in part, "Most students here
don't know what the SAF fee currently
amounts to and couldn't care less about
SBC policies..." I am appalled that I need
to remind The Phoenix editors that an
under-informed student body does not
give the College license to senselessly
raise the SAF that amounts to taking
advantage of student apathy.
SBC has purchased several expensive
items like vans and WSRN equipment in
recent years, and there has also been a
trend of very loosely checked spending.

Of 224 students who filled out
an SBC survey about the SAF in
Sharpies, only a meager 14
supported the plan that The
Phoenix editorial board is
advocating clearly, it is either

own agenda or that its editorial
board is disastrously out of
touch with the rest of the

The capital replacement account has been
hemorrhaging money for the past few
years and it is now painfully close to
empty.
If the College were to raise the SAF by
more than $45, it would force present and
future students to payfor the incompetence
and the fiscal recklessness of past Student
Budget Committees, and this is intolerable.
Raising the SAF by more than what is
necessary reflects poorly on the College.
It would be an unjustifiable and unprecedented increase in the SAF there has
been no such dramaticraise in the past 15
years. The College would be tongue-tied
if asked to explain why the SAF fee would
have to skyrocket next year. There simply is no reason.

Black history needs more recognition
By Carlyle Price
For The Phoenix

I have this calendar on my wall in my

room; it was a Christmas present. I

*

#

thought it was a pretty crappy present at
the time (still do, in fact). However, it has
served as a good reminder of the times it
honors, despite the fact I don't look at it
nearly often enough.
It's a black history calendar. When I
first opened it, I flipped through some
entries: birthdays, historical events and
firsts
it bored me, frankly. A lot of
people who broke ground and were forgotten. I found this sad, but not particularly interesting. I didn't think it made
me a badblack person; we all have members of our family we don't particularly
care about.
However, I paid attention to this month,
partly due to my birthday, partly because
this month has the most "cool" stuff in it
and partly because it was Black History
Month.
Then I got to thinking: Carter G.
Woodson did not, I'm pretty sure, have
this in mind when he first conceived the
notion of Negro History Week (first celebrated Feb. 7,1926, for the record). Not
calendars, and greeting cards, and other
such bastardizations of what has become
for most a month of apathy. Even for me...
even at Swarthmore.
When I went (okay, I was dragged) to
the Black Political Thought Forum, I understood it to be the first of many events
to celebrate Black History Month here on
campus. I even believe something to that
effect was stated at the time. I'm not saying that there weren't any other events
I, regrettably, wasn't particularly paying
attention.
What I'm saying is that in my neck of the
woods, all I heard about was a dance performance the night of the Screw Your
Roommate formal, a night of "soul food" at
Sharpies, a political forum in which thepanelistsbickered so much the evening became
counter-productive and perhaps a party.

This is SwatThis is one place
where freedoms, beliefs, and
understandings are had that
don't seem to happen anywhere
else.We strive to better
ourselves as individuals and as a
community.
And so passes Black History Month
2000, extra day and all.
For those who had no special need to pay
attention, nothing more has happened than
another month of non-enlightenment. To
those who should have been, the same.
However, to those who were looking, a
travesty.
I understand that we go to Swarthmore.
I understand the pressures of Swat. I understand that it is difficult to take the time
and the energy to create something that
will enlighten and uplift people on campus. I understand that usually, it seems
that events of this nature seem like
preaching to the converted. But that
doesn't make this right.
I'm not condemning the inactivity of
people here who should have done something to prepare for this month, or the
deeds of thosewho did. What I have to say
doesn't just pertain to them, it pertains to

everybody who believes in celebrating
their culture and educating others about
it
myself included. If I don't say it,
someone else may not.
This is Swat. This is one place where
freedoms, beliefs, and understandings are
had that don't seem to happen anywhere
else. We strive to better ourselves as individuals and as a community. Last week's
cover, "Women In Science," made sense
to me; that is what Swat's all about. Sonia
Scherr 'Ol did an excellent job (again) in
pointing out some of what makes Swat
truly special.
On the other hand, there could be so
much more; it doesn't necessarily have
to be hard to do. Langston Hughes was
born on Feb. 1... how cool would a poetry
slam that day have been? Bob Marley was
born on Feb. 6 like that birthday party
couldn't have been cool? Nelson Mandela
was released from prison on Feb. 11; it
would have been interesting to learn
about progression in his decade of freedom, or since Malcolm X was assassinated 35 years ago this Presidents' Day.
My personal favorite: Marian Anderson,
one of Philly's own, was born on my birthday.
We shouldn'tallow people to forget; too
many are still struggling for their sign of
recognition.
Maybe that calendar wasn't such a
crappy gift after all.

Gore's record
on abortion
forgivable
Al Gore has come under heavy fire over
the last few weeks, mostly from his opponent Bill Bradley, for his inconsistency on
the abortion issue. Gore, whose political career began in the House of Representatives
in the 1970s and 80s, used to oppose federal
financing for abortions that poor women
could not afford. Now, he insists, "I have always supported a woman's right to choose."
Bradley, trailing Gore in the race for the
Democratic presidential nomination, has
seized this opportunity to attack Gore's
record, calling him a "conservativeDemocrat." Indeed, before Gore became a U.S.
senator in 1985, the National Right to Life
Committee gave him an 84 percent score
for voting in line with its positions. Now,
Bradley is labeling himself as "the only
candidate who's always been pro-choice."
It is worth noting that Gore never supported a Constitutionalamendment to prohibit abortion, and when he ran for Senate
in 1984, he supported the right to an abortion even though he did not support federal
financing for it. Furthermore, Gore's voting record became increasingly pro-choice
once he joined the Senate, and he had embraced federal financing for abortions by
the time he ran for president in 1988.
Should Gore be punished for his voting
record 15 to 25 years ago? I don't think so.
First, even if Gore switchedpositions for
political reasons, to bring himself more in
line with national party standards, he is unlikely to abandon that position once in the
White House. As NARAL president Kate
Michelman said, "The fact that he evolved
doesn't make him any less pro-choice than
Bradley or anyone else." In fact, in one of
his first public disagreements with the
Clinton administration, Gore criticized a
recent White House budget compromise
that withdrew funding from international
family planning programs in order to pass
United Nations arrears payments.
Second, Gore's changing position reflects a nationwide polarization of the
abortion debate.Abortion has always been
a hot issue, but the 1990s has seen it become more emotionally charged than ever.
Now, no one gets caught in the crossfire
of this debate—you're either on one side
or the other. Said Senator Charles
Schumer in Gore's defense: "There are
lots of people who would now be regarded
as pro-choice as they come who voted very
similarly to Al Gore in the mid-1980s."
Third, and most importantly, Gore should
be praised for not treating abortion as a
simple or clear issue. To have some doubts
about abortion and the government's role
in supporting it can be reflective of more
sophisticated political thought than we're
used to seeing in our.politicians, and it's
just possible that Gore was wrestling with
these dilemmas himself.
Gore's best move now would be to fess
up to his past and to admit that he never
treated abortion as an open-and-shut case.
Few Americans ever do, and they should
expect of their president nothing less.

A warm reception for all students who enter McCabe
By David King
Phoenix Staff
On a Tuesday night last month, Ben
Criscuolo sat alone at his desk in McCabe
looking at a magazine. Suddenly, a group
of more than a dozen students appeared
from behind a corner.
Eyeing him contentedly, they converged
on his desk and broke the quiet of the room
with a round of "Happy Birthday."
"Speech," someone in the crowd called
out.

In a school of only 1370 undergraduates,
Swarthmore students quickly come to recognize familiar faces. For those who frequent McCabe, there is perhaps none
more familiar than that of Ben Criscuolo.
Sunday through Thursday evenings,
patrons entering and exiting the library
encounter receptionist Ben Criscuolo.
From behind his metal desk adjacent to
the doorway, Ben greets those who walk
by in a gentle, amiable voice: "G'night,
take care," or "Take care, have a good
one." And students return the greeting,
often smiling.
Yet, to a few students, Ben is more than
a kind staff member. To some, the 56-yearold, jeans- and t-shirt-wearing man with a
round face and large-rimmed glasses is a
friend, someone with whom to shoot the
breeze or even philosophize.
Fatima Colman-Arrellaga'OO has known
Ben since her freshman year. ColmanArrellaga's job as a Safewalk escort entails spending one night a week in the library waiting for students seeking an escort to their rooms.
She regularly chooses to study next to
Ben. Talking with him
about his cats,
his kids, their weekends, the news—helps
her get her mind off her work. "It's the
best seat [in] the house," she noted.
Dan Marrin 'Ol recently spoke passionately with Ben about Marrin's semester
in Ecuador. "[He's] somebody I've enjoyed
getting to know," Marrinremarked ofBen,
"because he's not in the same frenetic selfabsorbed rhythm as many others."

JANE LiU

Ben attended Saint Joseph's University,
but left after one year to work and care
for his sick parents. Since 1975, the Delaware County resident has worked two jobs
to put his three sons through college.
After his youngest son, Michael, graduates in May, he plans to work for another
year or two before quitting both jobs and
travelling with his wife of 29 years.
During the day, Ben works as a security officer at Jefferson University in
Philadelphia. Depending on the day of the
week, Ben will only get two or three hours
of sleep between his two jobs; his McCabe
duty ends at 1 a.m. and he wakes up at 5
a.m. to go to Jefferson. Four days a week,
he is off from one of the two jobs; the remaining three, he works from morning to
night without a nap.
A former naval yeoman, Ben spent
three months at a naval base in
Guantanamera, Cuba during the Cuban
Missile Crisis. In 1961, he was scheduled
to try out for the Kansas City As (before
the Royals arrived,) but he broke his wrist
in a football game a week beforehand and
missed the opportunity.
A soft spot in Ben's rich past, to hear
him tell it, is John F. Kennedy.
"He is my idol," he said. "He is the reason I went into the service."
Once during Kennedy's presidency, Ben
was invited to a ball at the White House
as part of an honor guard. Before the ball
began, he and the others in the guard were
told to prepare themselves for inspection.
They stood at attention and in walked
Kennedy.
"When he walked in the room, my knees
were weak," Ben recalled.
As the president toured the room, he
passed silently by many of the men. Then
he stopped at Ben. As Ben sweated in nervousness, the president complimented
him on the shine of his shoes.
In last fall's college library newsletter,
a front page article reported students'
opinions of the libraries, solicited in a survey last April. "Most students didn't like
the climate or the carpeting," it said of

BRENDAN KARCH | Phoenix Staff

McCabe receptionist Ben Criscuolo used to be a semi-professional baseball pitcher and naval
yeoman. He now recognizes the face of almost every McCabe regular.

McCabe, "but they did really like Ben!"
Last year's graduating class voted Ben

as one of the top three people they would
like to have speak at graduation. (He didn't
make the final cut.)
Ben estimates that he knows 99 percent
of the students who pass him by face, and
60 to 70 percent by name. But in the 4 1/2
years since he began working at the college, he has never been to graduation.
"I feel that the amphitheater is not for
staff," he said.
One night, Ben revealed the story behind a curious trademark of his: nightly
Far Side comics.
Ben's first semester at Swarthmore, a
student walked into the library crying.
Her brother was sick, and she asked Ben
if he had a joke to make her smile. He

showed her a Far Side strip. The picture
had Moses looking in the mirror, with his
hands up and his hair parting down the
middle. The caption: "Moses parting his
hair." The young woman laughed.
From that day on, he has displayed a
different Far Side strip (if not two or
three) every evening he has been on duty.
When the newspaper stopped running
them, he cut them out from anthologies
he bought at Borders.
"For some students," he said, "that
might be the only smile they get that day."
"More than the money, more than anything, it's the people," Ben said of his evenings at Swarthmore. "My greatest joy has
been the students."
"This is the future," Ben said, referring
to Swarthmore students. "I'm so happy."

Remember when superheroes could move planets?

th

ton

oir

Another week, another poster
slogan: "Remember when superheroes could move planets?" Joe
Casey and Brian Holguin do.
With a dose of nostalgic reveries
and a fair amount of talent on
both their parts, these two writers present "Mr. Majestic."
Book: "Mr. Majestic" No. 1-6

(Wildstorm.) By Joe Casey, Brian

Holguin, Ed McGuinness and Jason Martin.

What it's about: Mr. Majestic,
born on the planet Khera, is now
secret defender of the planet
Earth. The details of his origin
are still a mystery to us all. His
secret hideout is inside Mt.
Rushmoreand it's equipped with
enough toys to make Batman
blush.
His partner in crime is
Desmond, who is introduced to
the readers as "the tinker-toy

genius. One-of-a-kind orphan of
micro circuitry and insolence.
The boy is the quantum-mechanical bubble."
They work together with the
world's top scientists and some
men in black, and they give the
world as we know it a chance to
see another day.
Issue 1, entitled "Cosmology,"
runs chronologically from the
Vietnam War to the bombing of
Libya. But these events of our
history serve only as a backdrop.
The actual danger introduced
early in this issue results in Mr.
Majestic's literal reconfiguration
of our solar system. In one awesome scene, he turns our central,
solitary star into a binary sun.
Now that's cool.
And how do these writers follow up such a big bang of a first
issue? Well, in issue 2, they introduce a little girl who is "a living
anomaly;" she should never have
existed and because she -does,
time itself is thrown for a spin.
In 1999, the Black Plague revisits France, Mongol hordes
storm across Chinaand Liberace
shows up for his 10 p.m. show at
the Tropicana.
Issue 3 introduces a "friend" of

Madge, Maxine, who is part human, part machine, a "nun" of the
Church of Gort which revolves
around "the binary evolution."
The two crazy kids go out for a
night on the town, which of
course gets a little more crazy
then either intended.
Issue 4 tells the story of Mr.
Majestic and the son that he lost.
The reader is introduced to
Madge at his most "human."
Issue 5 involves a jailbreak of
one of the ugliest monsters that
I've ever had the horror of seeing. Their attempts at world
domination are mistaken for a
new sitcom when they try to seduce the earthlings into submission by their "irresistible charisma" via the good ol' television
And finally, number 6, "Why
2K," is a millennium story, complete with a satirical approach to
the Y2K frenzy that was so
prominent in our society last
year.

great stories that, even while
fantastical in nature, still reflect
trends and thoughts of current
relevance to our "real world."
The continuing theme of the
"binary revolution" is thoughtprovoking and fresh. I also really
like the fact that Madge takes the
time to question whether he
should be doing what he's doing.
In issue 1 he has a "crisis of
faith," in which he questions his
plan ofattack. "I'm not a God, yet
I'm attempting a God's task." I
like these moments of hesitation.
McGuinness is great fun too.
He literally draws Madge as
larger than life. The comic books
are full of bright colored panels
and large Mr. Majesties.
And, as you can already tell, all
of the first six issues were one
shots. That is, they were self-contained stories. Thus, no prior
knowledge is necessary to pick
up any of these books.

But... This is no longer the
case. With issue 7, a multi-issue
story arc has begun. That's a little
annoying to me. At the same
time, McGuinness has left the
book, which is another sore point
with me.
:

Why I like it: First of all, I'm a
big time Joe Casey fan. He's done
"X-Men" books, "The Incredible
Hulk" and also has another book,
"Deathlock," out right now. He
has an incredible range in telling

defender ofEarth

The writers are still a constant,
but the truth is that by number
6, the book was definitely losing
some steam.
Last word: Try out issues 1-3.
If you like them, pick up a few
more. It's easy to get into. It's
also not too hard to get out of.
Peace out.

also to be the chancellor of the college and his boss's wife,
informs him of her pregnancy. And, stepping outside for an
evening stroll and a joint to clear his head, he runs into James
Leer the strangest, most emotionally disturbed and possibly
also the most talented student in his creative writing class,
who's lurking in the shadows, twirling a gun in his hand. As if
that weren't enough, Grady's editor is in town, hoping to give
the author the kick in the ass that he needs to wrap up his
latest piece. What Grady's editor, played by Robert Downey,
Jr., doesn't know is that the book that Grady has spent the last
decade on has grown to enormous proportions (think 2500
pages) and is far from finished.

Tripp is stumped, unable to complete his work in a succinct
manner because he's lost touch with himself, because he
doesn'tknow what he wants or where he's going with his life.
Maybe it's because his life seems shot to hell. Whatever the
case, Grady Tripp is in need of either escape or rescue.
That's where James Leer, the queerest of the queer, comes
in. He sets out, perhaps unconsciously, to help the professor
discover his true identity by thrusting him into a series of
quirky events involving a not-so-minor crime spree.
The two struggle with each other, stumbling in their relationship (the boundaries of which are never clearly defined)
Grady begins to feel close to James, as though they've formed
a deep, philosophical bond... and then he learns that everything James has told him is a lie. James has been systematically weaving a tale in his head to earn either Grady's pity or
his respect. Disturbed at first by James's lack of credibility,
Grady eventually adjusts to his tendency towards pathological lying and commits himself to helping James get published,
with or without a college degree.
The hilarious sequence of events is only one aspect of Wonder Boys" that makes it worth watching. Aside from comic
relief, this movie has much to offer by way of thought-provoking material. The relationship formed between the strange
professor and his stranger student not only redefines a liberal arts education, but also illustrates the unexpected effects,
for better or worse, that people have on each other. Grady and
James's relationship was complicated and highly unpredictable, but it directly benefitedboth parties: helping James, who
sees Grady and the mess he'd made of his life, recognize and
change some things in himself, and redirecting the old professor, who, on losing his book and reading James's own work,
decides that maybe it's time to start again.

"I leave my stuff in McCabe for
days," Ben Schweigert 'O2 said
with sheepish pride. "I used to be
careful back home, but this is
Swarthmore," he said, gesturing to
his unattended backpack lying some
100 feet down Parrish beach.
Schweigert is not alone in his faith in
Swarthmore security. Despite a recent string
ofwell-publicized incidences of theft, many students routinely leave their wallets, their bikes
and even their rooms to the mercy of campus
criminals.
In the past few months, thebeliefs of students
like Schweigert have been challenged by the
reality of thefts of unattended valuables from
a number ofall-campus spaces and dorms. And

while most students

A String ofThefts in LPAC

Since the beginning of the semester, about five thefts have reportedly occurred in
the dressing rooms of Lang Performing Arts Center (LPAC). All thefts have taken
place during scheduled dance classes and thus at times when the rooms are filled
with unattended backpacks and clothes.
Susan Smythe, managing director of LPAC, put up signs warning students to secure their valuables, and though many of the signs have been torn down, most dance
students seem aware of the thefts. Dance instructors have been encouraging students to take their possessions with them into the studio rather than leave them in
the dressing room. And according to officer Chris Smith, Public Safety has doubled
its checks of the building in an effort to discourage criminal activity.
Yet this is not the first time that the dressing rooms have been the site of theft.
According to Smythe, a string of thefts occurred there last spring, and signs were
also put up at that time.
Jen Slaw 'OO remembers seeing those signs, but she continued to store her belongings in the dressing room during dance class until her $BO sneakers were stolen.
She suspects that a student did it, as the theft occurred on an especially busy night
in LPAC. "I wouldn't want to think it was other students, but I think it probably was,"
Smythe said that the LPAC management considered tighter security measures,
including installing a camera in the hallway outside the studios, but decided that its
efforts were better directed at raising student awareness. "Students leave an incredible amount of money and valuables lying around it's surprising," she said.
Slaw, who also had a sweatshirt stolen during a party earlier this year, has since
been much more cautious about her belongings. "Ever since these two incidents, I'll
never leave anything out again."
-

Many Thefts Avoidable

According to the people at Public Safety, it should not take a personal encounter
with theft to make a student careful.
"It amazes me that people would be so naive as to leave a bag that may have $5O in
it lying around," said Terri Narkin, a Public Safety administrative assistant.
According to Public Safety Director Owen Redgrave, the recent string of thefts
does not point to a lack of campus security or even to an increase in overall criminal
activity. Although reported thefts have increased dramatically, from 44 in 1998 to
114 in 1999,Redgrave said that this might be due to the high number of license plate
thefts late last year as well as to other external factors, such as an increase in the
proportion of thefts that are reported.

Easy Dorm Access Brings Risks

Redgrave cautioned, "You really have
to look at it in the long term
I'd have to
see a lot bigger numbers to say that we're
going through something unusual."
Whether or not they indicate an increase
in crime, the recent thefts are regrettable
because they show that, despite warnings
to the contrary, most students continue to
be careless about securing their belongings. In general, Redgrave said, a large
proportion of thefts occur because students leave their valuables unattended or
their dorm rooms open.
"Almost all the thefts on our campus are
nonforcible thefts. In very few cases do
we have forcible thefts," Redgrave said.
Even burglaries, which are distinguished
from thefts in that they involve illegally
entering a space that is not open to the
public, "typically [occur] in open rooms
in the dorms."
Redgrave is not overly sympathetic to
the student targets of such nonforcible
thefts. "I'm not sure I can think of a place
where I've been where, if I left my wallet
down and walked away for half an hour, I
had the expectation that it would be there
intact when I came back," he said. "It's no
different here. People like to think that it
is, but it's not."
Redgrave said he worries thatthe trusting behavior of the student body will earn
Swarthmore the reputation of an easy target among criminals. "Criminals typically
associate with other criminals, and when
they're successful, they go back and discuss their successes. It's like finding a
good fishing hole you talk about it and
goback and everyone's at the fishing hole.
We don't want that to happen."
To some extent, it seems it already has.
According to Redgrave, a razor and several photographs were stolen from Willets
Monday night in apparently unrelated incidents. Redgrave said that, close to the
time of the thefts, one Willets resident
reported overhearing several teenagers
who were assumed not to be Swarthmore
students discussing the ease with which
they had entered the dorm. One of the
teenagers apparently remarked on
Swarthmore dorms being "easy to get
into."
...

-

www.phoenix.swarthmore.edu

The practice of door propping would
certainly support the teenager's assessment. Nearly every dorm has an entrance
in which the door is propped with large
objects or the locking mechanism is disabled with paper or cardboard.
The danger that comes with the convenience of easy access to dorms is also well
established. Last November, a string of
thefts occurred in Wharton, where the
door is often propped open.
The entrance to Mary Lyon also invites
visitors, a convenience that comes with
risk, as former resident Nadav Tanners
'O2 discovered. Tanners came home from
class one day last year to discover that his
new laptop had been stolen from his unlocked room there.
Tanners' insurance covered the cost of a
new computer, but the incident has left a
lasting impression on him. "I left [my door]
unlocked up until the time it was stolen,
and I've locked it ever since," he said.
Redgrave emphasized that thefts such
as the one Tanners experienced would not
occur if students were more cautious with
their belongings.
"I don't think you have to go to extremes
here to safeguard your property," he said.
"Locking doors in rooms, locking the door
to your residence hall and not leaving your
articles unattended would probably knock
down 90 percent of those numbers."
For Victor Salcedo 'OO, such precautions
are second nature. Salcedo, who takes his
valuables with him on bathroom trips in
McCabe, said, "Even in Sharpies, I see
people leave their bookbags up top with
their wallets in them. Ifthey get them stolen, I say, you kind of deserve it. It's common sense."

Building Security Problems
It seems that students are not the only
ones on campus who have blind faith in
campus security, however. Some students
noted that they wouldn't have to worry so
much about their belongings if campus
buildings were better secured. Most academic buildings are easily accessible to
those outside the college community, even
during nighttime hours, when they are infrequently used.

File Photo

The remnants of one of two projectors stolen from Kohlberg last November hangs from the
ceiling. Public Safety has attributed the thefts to lax building security and poorly secured valuables.

CAYLEY PENDERGRASS | Phoenix Staff

The dressing room in LPAC, where most dance students leave their belongings during classes,
has been the site of a number of thefts of wallets, clothing and backpacks this semester.
On separate evenings in May and November 1999, three overhead video and
computer projectors were stolen from
classrooms in Kohlberg. Since there was
no sign offorced entry, it is likely that the
classrooms were unlocked, as they often
are at night.
The security of the projectors was also
minimal. "They weren't very well secured," Redgrave conceded. "It's just
[that] it's a very unusual piece of property
to be stolen."
A proposed swipecard system that
would allow access to academic buildings
only for students, faculty and staff would
secure such equipment from the outside
community. Redgrave intimated that it
would be several years before such a system would be implemented, however.
For the time being, Redgrave said an ad
hoc committeehas been formed to explore
methods ofbetter securing costly technological equipment. The committee has
considered changing evening hours for
academic buildings, but this was rejected
as too great an academic sacrifice.
"There's this balance that the college
has always had between the educational
mission of the college and security,"
Redgrave said. "The more security measures, the less access students have to [the
college's educational resources]."
The most likely changes will target individual pieces of equipment like the projectors. "We're looking at perhaps taking
some steps to improve security for certain items," Redgrave said.
But even with tightened building security,
glitches in the Swarthmore security system
would remain, several board members of
the Women's Resource Center (WRC) suggested at their meeting last Sunday.
Sometime on February 18 or 19, a VCR
was stolen from the WRC after the hosts

of a private party failed to lock the back
door. According to the board members, the
VCR was forcefully ripped from the cart
to which it had been attached, leaving the
lock that had secured it severed in two.
The board is working on heightening the
security for the WRC, but members complained that their efforts are frustrated
by Public Safety's liberal distribution of
the WRC key, which should be given out
only to a designated group of people.
"The main problem is even if we lock
our doors, it's easy for females to get the
key to the WRC," Siobhan Carty 'Ol said.
Redgrave said that, though exceptions
are occasionally made, Public Safety almost always follows the guidelines for key
distribution given to it by the various campus groups that use the service. "If it's
been clear that they only want people on
the list to have a key, I don't see why we
wouldn't follow that."

Many Students Still Optimistic
Though both academic buildings and
dorms are clearly inadequate in terms of
security, many students retain great levels of trust in the safety of the Swarthmore
campus.
For example, Tanners, despite the theft
he experienced, does not take many other
security precautions except locking his
door, and he still likes to see Swarthmore
as a trusting and family-like community.
"I guess I'm kind ofidealistic in that way,"
he said.
Samara Freemark 'O2, who had her bike
seat stolen earlier this year, echoed Tanners' optimism.Freemark now takes care
to secure her bike seat, but she said that
in other areas of her life she is less careful. "I think I've subscribed to the bubble
mentality a little too much. I should have
learned my lesson, but I haven't."

Daired
Sports Illustrated
Ever since Kathy Ireland reigned in
Spain in 1992, the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue has been part of my life, standing out over the tawdry and classless
porno magazines, seedy women's underwear catalogs and late night phone sex ads
as the primary symbol of male adolescence.
I have reached a point in my life where
the contrast between my understanding
of societal forces and my simple enjoyment of scantily clad supermodels is causing intense conflict.
To illustrate, here is an example of a
conversation between the different sides
of me.
Bad Ted: Remember the epic 1996
Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue that had
a picture of Rebecca Romijn leaning
against the rock and Stacy Williams in the
wet translucent dress? 1998 saw the coming out of Heidi Klum. Last year, it was
body painting. Man, this year, they've got
3-D and more breasts than the Perdue
chicken factory. Quality.
Good Ted: How can you live with yourself? After three years of work with
people with eating disorders, watching
friends go on crash diets and spending a
week hospitalized in the eating disorder
ward ofChildren's Hospital in Boston and
meeting horrifically thin people, how can
you enjoy something like that?
Primitive, id-driven Ted: I'm a terrible,
terribleperson. But I can't... resist... staring at Jason Kidd's wife. Man, she's redefining taking it to the rack.
Sensitive, liberal arts-educated Ted:
Gee, I think reading this magazine objectifies women. When I was walking down
Parrish Beach with my 3-D glasses on, I
shouldn't have been surprised my girlfriend whacked me upside the head. I deserved it for helping to perpetuate a body
image and not giving proper respect to a
sex that produced important figures in my
life such as my mommy and my girlfriend.
Caveman Ted: The picture of Elsa on
page 52 is tastier than a home-cooked
meal.
As you can see, the fact that I enjoy staring at pictures of girls who have had a
piece of lettuce and an ice cube for lunch
does in fact disturb me. I admit this, and
to every woman out there who has ever
felt overweight or unattractive because
of the media, I apologize. If it makes you
feel any better.
Meanwhile, my swimsuit issue remains
withinreach of my desk. During the early
hours of the morning, it will remind me
that if I hadn't gone to Swarthmore, I
wouldn't be writing a dissertation on the
striate cortex discriminating sinusoidal
gratings in the perceptual system. It will
remind me that if I hadn't gone to
Swarthmore and gotten all socially aware,
I wouldn't know that two of the things I
enjoy most, sports and swimsuits, are contributing significantly to the crumbling of
Western civilization.
Rather, I would be sitting on a beach in
West Tahiti or UCLA with a supermodel
eating pistachios. Meanwhile, if you pass
by me in the halls or in Sharpies, feel free
to do as my girlfriend did and whack me
upside the head. I deserve it.

Women's tennis heads to Arizona
The Swarthmore women's tennis team
begins their spring season this coming
week on their training trip to Arizona. In
Arizona, the team is to play a tough schedule featuring Albion College (MI, D 3),
Providence University (RI, Dl), University of Pittsburgh (Dl), and Scottsdale
Community College (AZ). The players are
looking forward to hitting the courts and
finally beginning match play, though they
will miss the presence of #1 singles player,
Jennifer Pao'ol, who is not able to make
the trip. This means everyone will play
up a spot on the team and the doubles
teams will be shifted for spring break,
which will make for some exciting and
challenging tennis.
After spring break, the team's first
match is at home on Tuesday, March 21,
against Washington College. The team is
looking forward to improving last year's
Centennial Conference fourth place ranking. With the loss of only one senior, the
team feels confident about playing better
with the addition of freshman Tanya
Chotibut 'O3, Katherine Voll 'O3, Elizabeth
Nolte 'O3, and Kara Levy 'O3. Also, sophomore Nellie Tong has joined the team after playing badminton this winter and
JamieFlather 'OO has returned from a semester abroad to play. The women look
forward to taking some revenge for last
year's losses and regain their status as a
top team in the conference.

The snow has melted, the ground is
thawing, and the sports teams are abandoning the dungeon that is the field house
for their outdoor facilities. What does the
spring season have in store for us? As I
gaze into my crystal ball, I can see the
futures of several of the varsity, IM, and
club sports. Here are my predictions for
the spring season (in other words, it was
a very slow sports week, so bear with me):
Rugby: Players spend their Saturday
afternoons attempting to tear off their
opponents' heads, taking cheap shots at
crotches, and overall causing massive
amounts of pain. Saturday nights are spent
getting belligerent with the opposing team
and later hooking up with teammates.
Lacrosse: Star player leaves in the
middle of the big game to sing "How Sweet
it is to be Loved by You" at an a cappella
concert to impress a girl. The coach and
teammates are dumbfounded while the
player gets the girl. Post-game party includes large serving of apple pie.
IM Basketball: A sudden influx of basketball talent will increase the competitiveness of the league. As a result, the bar
will be raised so that washed up sports
writers with no lefthand or jump shot will
not be able to participate.
Outdoor Track: After a long layoff from
indoor track, the outdoor track team will
begin running ridiculous distances to prepare themselves to run for next Fall's
cross country season, which will prepare
themto run for indoor track in the winter,
which will in turn prepare them to run in

won their games by incredible margins:
an easy 13-1 thumping of University of
Delaware, a sweet victory of 12-1 over
Princeton, and only slightly less obscene
9-4 conquerings of both Haverf ord and U
Penn. Perhaps we should have expected
it—these ladies are ranked seventh in the
nation.
The Earthworms fought through a tough
tournament and narrowly defeated
Brandeis 9-7 and Johns Hopkins 11-9.
Their losses were also close, coming in an

Spring sports warm up

conferences
By Donald Nguyen and Marc Jeuland
Phoenix Staff
The finale to the indoor track and field
season saw the setting of a number of
school records. Five such marks were recorded in sprints and distanceraces, more
than at any meet in recent memory. These
accomplishments and numerous personal
bests are particularly notable because
they took place at the Conference Cham-

pionships.
Two women set two records each, leading the team to a fourth-place finish overall, just behind third-place Gettysburg.
Imo Akpan 'O2 ran a splendid meet, shattering the conference and school record
in the 55 meter qualifying trials. She ran
7.32, a full two tenths of a second faster
than any previous Swat athlete, and qualified provisionally for NCAA Nationals.
She later finished second in the finals. But
Akpan was not done. She also broke the
school record in the 200 meter dash, running 26.70, finishing second in that race
as well. Akpan also ran on the fourth-place
4x400 relay team and on the fifth-place
4x200 relay team.
But she was not the only one breaking
multiple records. Jokotade Agunloye 'Ol
ran 10:40.81 in the 3000 meter run, taking
third in the race and first in the school
record books. The next day, she ran
18:17.57 in the 5000 meter run, eclipsing
the old school mark by four seconds and
finishing second overall. Agunloye also
ran on the fourth-place 4xBoo relay team,
which missed the school record by just a
few seconds, and on the 4x400 relay team.
Also scoring for the women were
Desiree Peterkin 'OO, who defended dual
jumping titles (long jump and triple jump)
and ran on two relays (4x200 and 4x400);
Sarah Jay 'Ol (sixth place, 1500 meter run,
4x400,4x800); Clara Fuchsman 'Ol (fourth
place, shot put); Raylene Ross 'OO and
Sophia Acord 'O3 (4x200); and Karen Lloyd

Ah, spring.
For me, spring always brings lacrosse:
fresh air, clear skies, the joy of the sport.
But then again, I'm not your average
American. For many, spring brings fond
memories and longing for our so-called
national pastime, baseball.
I'm not one of them. In fact, baseball is
very low on my list of interesting and important sports. It might even be down
there with curling. I would even go as far
to say that baseball is a waste of time,
money and effort. I'm sure all die-hard
baseball fans have written me off as some
girly girl who just doesn't understand
sports, but I do have legitimate reasons
for my distaste, and most boil down to
"there's just too much!"
—The number of statistics involved in
the sport is absurd. There's BA, HR, RBI,
OBP, slugging percentage, hits, ERA,
WHIP, SO, Saves, etc, etc. It seems that if
you can count it, or stretch an occurrence
into a pattern, it becomes a stat. Who really cares how many times someone has
hit into a double play (GIDP)?
—The sports media get far too excited
about baseball. Read any Sunday sports
section in any paper, and you will encounter about 15 pages of pure baseball. They
feel the need to analyze every single game
for a good half page, then list all of the
endless stats for even the minor league
players. I wouldrather read the business
section.
—The games themselves are too long.
Nothing will happen for a good45 minutes,
then Mark McGwire will step up and hit a
home run. Much excitement for about two
minutes, then back to the beer and chips.
—Doubleheaders need to go. The only
thing worse than watching an entire baseball game is watching two.
—The players fit into one of two categories. Those who look good in tight pants,
and those who don't. Most fit into the latter.

—There's a Little League World Series.
Some parents seem to think that theirchildren, mostly boys, (as girls play softball
so they don't get hurt), are playing in the
pros. In certain areas, some Little League
teams have better resources thanthe Swat
baseball team.
—Those I talked to seem to rate baseball, on a scale from one to 10, around a
6.5. There were two major reasons behind
the rating. First, the baseball fans seem
to agree that the game is too slow. While
there are exciting games every once in a
while, the regular season seems to stretch
in an endless wasteland of spitting and
scratching. For the non-baseball virtuoso,
the reputation of baseball as the national
pastime seems to be the only redeeming
quality of the sport. So either you're a
wacko sports enthusiast, or you put value
in tradition.
How do you make baseball more palatable? Shorten everything. Power baseball:
almost sudden death. Four innings, with
10 teams in the league, 12 weeks of play
Pare down the ranks to the best 150 players, and get rid of farm teams. Little
League can stay, but only as a non-competitive activity used to keep thekids busy
So as the days get longer and warmer, I
hope all of you baseball fans find pleasure
in all of the spring training and opening
days.
I think I'll stick with lacrosse.
