TOVER STORY: THE IMPACT OF SArCOTS

Activities cuts take effect

19 percent cut hitting small groups the hardest

BY SONIA SCHERR
Nearly sixmonths after this year's
funding was reduced by 19 percent for
all groups financed by Student Budget Committee (SBC), Swarthmore
Protestant Community (SPC), one of
nearly 100 affected organizations, is
struggling to continue programs that
in recent years have become campus

traditions.

According to SPC advisor Pauline
Allen, while the group lost less than
$lOO, its budget was already small
enough at just over $3OO that the funding cut has had a crippling impact.
Many ofSPC's programs —which
include retreats, all-campus study
breaks, bible study groups, social service and a speaker series—are aimed
at building community and do not
have a specific religious agenda,
Allen said. One of these activities is
the all-campus sing-along with the
creators of the songbook "Rise Up
Singing," which SPC sponsors at the
end of each academic year. Last year
more than 100 students attended the

event. But now the sing-along faces a
formidablefinancial hurdle: it costs $250
all of SPC's budget for the year—just

to bring the performers to campus.
"I don'tknow how we're going to do
it," Allen said of the sing-along. "[The
funding cut] is very frustrating for me

as an advisor because there's so many
things students want to do that now we
don't have the budget for."

Deficit spending crashes to a halt
From Social Affairs Committee
(SAC), which allocates fundsfor campus
parties, to Small Craft Warnings,
Swarthmore's longstanding literary
magazine, nearly 100 organizations were
faced with the 19 percent cut. And while
no one knows for sure exactly how the
across-the-board cut will impact campus
life, some groups like SPC are taking the hit harder than others.
The funding cut, which was approved
by Student Council this April upon the
recommendation of SBC, resulted in SBC
not giving out a total of about $70,000 that
it had allocated to groups during its annual spring budgeting.

According to SBC treasurer Marvin

Barron 'O2, the cut was necessary because SBC had been engaging in severe
deficit spending for the past three or four
years. Last year SBC over-allocated
funds by $40,000 and covered part of this
outflow by drawing from the capital replacement fund, which is supposed to be
reserved for such items as vans, computers and WSRN equipment. Further depleted by several large capital purchases, the fund
normally about
had a slightly negative bal$150,000
ance by the end of the spring semester.
"We were hemorrhaging money,"
Barron said. "We had to put the brakes
on all at once. We had to commit ourselves to being fiscally responsible."
Although SBC also raised this year's
student activities fee (SAF) to $250, an
increase of $24 over last year, all the additional money about $33,000 went

toward replenishing the depleted capital replacement fund. About $330,000 in
total was raised this year through the
SAF.

Bottled, canned
drinks to cost
25 cents more
Rising distributor prices constrain snack bar
BY IVAN BOOTHE
Effective the day classes resume after October break,
Essie Mae's snack bar in Tarble willraise prices by 25 cents
on bottled and canned drinks. Bottles will now cost $1.25,
and cans will run a full dollar.
Dining Services was forced into this action because of
a sharp increase in the cost of the items by the distributor,
according to Director of Dining Services Linda McDougall.
The issue first came up last semester, when McDougall
met with Student Council to discuss the deficits that were
mounting in Tarble. "Their solution was going to be to cut
meal equivalencies," said Will Ortman 'O2, the SC facilities and space coordinator. "We asked them instead to try
just raising the price of cans and bottles by a quarter."
Meal equivalencies will still be accepted for bottled and
canned drinks. In some cases, students may find that they
are able to purchase the same amount of food as last year
with their meal credits, as the amounts ofmealcredits were
raised by 25 cents earlier this year. They are now $2.25 for
breakfast, $3.25 for lunch, and $4.00 for dinner.
But students who choose to buy multiple bottled or
canned drinks as many do when they have extra meal
credit may be hit harder by the price rise.
Over the summer, Dining Services evaluated numerous distributors, finally settling on the cheapest one. According to McDougall, the distributor's prices were still
too high to make ends meet, so students will now have to
shell out an extra quarter for drinks at Essie Mae's.
The effects of this were not lost on Marie Dalton, the
director of the snack bar, so a juice dispenser similar to
those in Sharpies was recently installed. The price of a 16ounce cup of juice will be $l.OO, equivalent to the price of a
16-ounce bottle before the price raise.

Due to rising prices from food distributors, bottled and

Men and women
may be allowed
to room together
Housing Committee reverses stance, may
recommend allowing coed roommates in
some rooms in Roberts and the Lodges
BY GERRIT HALL
In a major reversal from Housing Committee's
former opposition to coed rooms, the committee
plans to propose that roommates of opposite sex
be allowed in some types of housing in some
dorms. The committee is now gathering student
input on the issue to form a proposal.
"We decided that we would allow coed housing
in Roberts and the Lodges," said committee
member Sabrina Parra-Garcia 'Ol
Parra-Garcia added that the housing committee
was thinking about extending the setup to Palmer
and Pittenger as well.
As it stands, there is no proposal on the table to
allow first-year students to be placed in coed
rooms. The final proposal would also likely restrict
the plan to certain types of housing units.
Director of Residential Life Myrt Westphal
stressed that the plan was tentative.
"The committee has agreed to a proposal, but
the wording has not been finalized," she said. "We
do endorse coed housing."
Before the proposal is finalized, it will be
released to the campus for discussion. The
proposal will be modified based on student input
before the committee makes its final proposal to
the dean.
The Housing Committee is an advisory
committee, which means it has no authority to
modify campus rules. It does, however, have
weight in making the decision, and its
recommendations are usually accepted.
Haverford College adopted a similar policy last
year, attracting national attention. At the time,
Westphal said, "We've talked about coed housing
before, and the Housing Committee been real
clear in its recommendation that we should not
have co-ed housing."
Tim Stewart-Winter 'Ol made the original
request that the Housing Committee reconsider
the rule.
"Housing as it stands is heterosexist," he wrote
in his proposal. Many gay rights activists feel that
forcing a gay or lesbian student to room with a
student of the same sex can place him or her in an
uncomfortable situation. Other proponents of coed
housing feel that students should be allowed to
make their own choices.
When the committee rejected coed housing last
year, it argued that straight couples would take
advantage of the situation to room together. Other
opponents of coed housing claim that it could be
interpreted as promoting sex between roommates.
The committee decided last year that such a policy
could hurt Swarthmore's image, which in turn
could affect the admissions process.
"As years change, attitudes change," Westphal
said of the committee's change of opinion. She
also cited the impetus of Haverford's decision.
When Haverford made its decision last year, its
students received the policy well, but only about
five of the school's 134 apartments housed mixedgender groups of students.
If the proposal is approved, it could take effect
as early as the housing lottery for next year.

Swatties tutor Chester High School students
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
The Chester-Upland School District ranks dead last
among the 501 school districts in Pennsylvania.
Its largely impoverished student body suffers from high
dropout and truancy rates, and most of its students come
from homes where neither parent attended college. It is
not an environment which one would expect to produce
competent graduates, let alone potential college students.
But for 35 years, the students and staff behind the
Swarthmore College Upward Bound program have looked
at things differently.
Working with funds provided by the U.S. Department
of Education, the program, according to its brochure, has
striven to "help students overcome class, social and cultural barriers" thatstand in the way of theirpath to higher

education.
The program stems from a national agenda called TRIO
that was established through the Higher EducationAct of
1965. According to Mike Robinson, the current director of

Swarthmore's Upward Bound chapter, Congress instated the
act "to mainstream lower-income kids from high school to
college." Over 1,200 TRIO programs exist around the United
States at host institutions like Swarthmore.
For three hours on Thursday afternoons and from 9 a.m.
to 1 p.m. on Saturdays, students from Chester High School
come to campus for rigorous academic instruction in math,
science and language arts. The classes are co-taught by
Swarthmore students and certified teachers, and tutoring is
provided by college volunteers who are expected to reinforce
what the high school students have learned and to act as role
models.

The high school students attend discussion groups and
cultural activities at other points during the week. They receive individual counseling through all steps of the college
application process and learn about their options through visits to different institutions and to college fairs.
Because the program is optional, its participants must show
a deep commitment to the entire process and to the demands
it places on them, ranging from extra course work to college

Gameroom proposals postponed

applications to extracurricular activities.
Swarthmore's chapter of Upward Bound is "one of the
most successful in this area," Robinson said. "Ninety-five
to 98 percent of our students go to college."
The criteria for a high school student's admission to
Upward Bound are based on income and on whether the
student has a parent who hasattended college. In keeping
with a national guideline, one-third of Upward Bound participants are from homes where neither parent has attended
college, and two-thirds havehousehold incomes lower than
$24,000 per year.
"The Chester-Upland School District has always been
our main cohort for Upward Bound," Robinson said. He
added that the program also serves some low-income students from the Swarthmore-Wallingford and Chichester

school districts.

According to Robinson, about ten Swarthmore students
are currently involved in the program, but he would like
to recruit more.
Interested students may contact Mike Robinson at x 8345.

Agunloye-Keys
ticket wins senior
class elections
BY JONATHAN EHRENFELD

Michael Pasahow Phoenix Staff

At the SC meeting Tuesday night, Tom Stepleton and Stephanie Wojtkowski discuss the SCCS
proposal to use the gameroom inthe basement of Tarble as a general purpose lounge and computer
lab. SCCS and three other student groups presented their proposals to SC at the meeting.

BY DANNY GUEVARA
After four groups presented proposals for use
of the gameroom space ranging from a late-night
convenience store to a meeting space for activist groups Tuesday night, Student Council postponed decisions on feasibility until its next meeting.

The council initially rejected the proposal for
an activist meeting space for its lack of financial specificity, but later rescinded the rejection
after other groups presented similarly undeveloped proposals. All groups will have until the
next council meeting on Oct. 23 to refine their
proposals.
A student referendum will be held from Nov.
1-3 to determine how to renovate the gameroom

in the basement of Tarble. All groups interested in having their renovation ideas put on
the ballot must first have their proposals approved by Student Council.
Though the council based its evaluation of
plausibility largely on the projected costs ofrenovation, the original guidelines for submitting
proposals only calledfor "a rough estimate of the
cost." This clause was interpreted differently by
the student groups; while some presented itemized budgets, others didn't have a budget at all.
The Swarthmore College Computing Society
submitted a comprehensive plan for a generalpurpose lounge and computer lab. According to
the group's proposal, the resources available to
students would be conference tables, nine computer workstations, and a multimedia room for
space

presentations, videos and games.
The SCCS plan initially gained the council's feasibility approval, but votes were thenrescinded out
of concern with fair procedure. The proposal will

be re-evaluated after fall break.
A less-specific proposal from a coalition of activist groups on campus would renovate the
gameroom space into a Center for Activism and
Public Service that would provide a permanent
home to groups such as Just Cause, Amnesty Internationaland Empty the Shelters.
"The activist groups on campus have for many
years now been a very important part of the
Swarthmore community, but there is no base for
us to coordinate together or maintain our institutional memory," said Sarah Drescher 'O3, co-sponsor of the proposal.
Horatiu Stefan 'Ol co-sponsored a proposal for
turning the gameroom space into a convenience
store.

Stefan has already discussed the workability of
his suggestion withLinda McDougall, the director
of Dining Services, but he planned on preparing
an itemized budget after the referendum.
According to McDougall, the convenience store
would give students a late-night dining option and
alleviate the pressure on Dining Services to extend
their hours. In addition, the student-staffed store
would provide more work-study options for students.
In a fourth proposal, Karima Wilson 'O3 suggested making the old gameroom into a student
lounge and meeting place to accommodate the various needs of different groups on campus.

The ticket with Joko Agunloye
and Ben Keys as co-presidents
emerged the victor over Jared
Solomon's ticket in the results of
class of 2001 elections announced
Friday, but some students are disputing the election, as a quarter of seniors did not receive ballots in their
mailboxes.
The seniors expressing dissatisfaction with the voting process claim
that the election was not conducted
in an organized or professional manner because not all seniors received
ballots.
According to GeoffSemenuk, production coordinator for alumni relations, ballots were placed in
roughly 75 percent of seniors' mailboxes. A worker for the alumni office was supposed to place a ballot
in all seniors' mailboxes, but somewhere in the process mailboxes were
missed.
Extra ballots were printed and
made available in the alumni office,
however.
While he acknowledged that the
elections have been disputed,
Semenuk said that the results of the
election were not close enough to
warrant another vote.
Although not every senior received a ballot, the vote percentages
received by the two tickets were relatively far apart.
Additionally, Semenuk said, all
seniors received ample warning
about the elections and information
regarding how and where to vote.
Due to the problems that arose
with placing ballots in mailboxes
and to the possibility of students
voting more than once, Semenuk
said that next year all ballots will be
held in the alumni office.
Students who wish to vote will
still have to show identification and
sign for their ballot, but the difference will be that they will not be able
to procure ballots outside the alumni
office like this year.

One senior, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that despite
efforts to check identification cards,
there were certainly seniors who
placed more than one ballot in the
box.
"I don't think it's worth coming
up with conspiracy theories about
how it happened, but the fact is that
it did happen," he said. The way in
which the voting was conducted was
unprofessional, he said, and should
not be repeated.
Other seniors, however, are skeptical.
BoHee Yoon 'Ol said that the precautions taken by the alumni office
to ensure thatall students voted once
were sufficient. She did not think
that students were casting more
than one vote.
"No, they were there checking ID
and having students sign their
names, so it definitely wasn't happening," Yoon said.
Aside from Agunloye and Keys,
the winning ticket included Claudia
Zambra, Nancy Craig, Evan Gregory, Pat Murray, Meg Lippincott
and Sarah Jay.
In addition to organizing events
and activities during the year such
as Pub Nite and senior week, the
week ofactivities before Commencement, the elected officers will continue to represent their class after
they have graduated.
The officers will also be in charge
of coordinating and managing class
reunions.
For now, the duties of the class officers revolve around fundraising for
senior week at the end of the year.
"We essentially have to plan activities for the whole class to participate in," said Claudia Zambra, the
senior class secretary.
The officers are currently planning a pre-Halloween party in
Wharton, T-shirt sales, and spring car
washes to raise money. Other activities will include a senior version of
Screw Your Roommate and a trip to
Atlantic City.

Students to spend fall break Moses speech
volunteering in Kensington
addresses black
cultural identity
BY NICOLE BRUNDA

This week, while other students
enjoy a restful week without classes,
members of Empty the Shelters, Fill
the Homes (ETS) will help work to

end global poverty.
The students will work in cooperation with the Kensington Welfare
Reform Union (KWRU) on a program
which will consist of education and
community service projects to help
students understand the effects of
poverty at all levels of society.
According to Sarah FrohardtLane 'O3, coordinatorof the fall break
program, the main goal is awareness.
"Especially at Swarthmore, none
of us are having to deal with whether
or not we will have a meal tomorrow,"
she said, "so the program is [about]
increasing the awareness of students
to how other people live."
The organization is also involved
in related work. "One of the big
projects we're doing is going into
welfare offices, emergency housing
offices, and other social service agencies and actually documenting what

steps a person had to go through to get

assistance," said Frohardt-Lane.
The project will take place in
Kensington, an economically underdeveloped region in North Philadelphia
where, according to Frohardt-Lane, the
leading source of income is welfare, fol-

lowed closely by drug trafficking.
The group will work with KWRU in
Kensington and stay in an home that

houses activists in West Philadelphia.
KWRU, which is an organization of
poor and homeless families working to

end poverty in the world, was established in 1991 by a group of poor women.
The group is now largely working in
response to the Personal Responsibilities
and Work Reconciliation Act, enacted in
1996, which attempted to get people off
welfare and into jobs. However, according to Frohardt-Lane, there aren't
enough jobs in Kensington to go around.

She said the group is working at a
grass-roots level to increase awareness
of poverty and build a movement of poor
people to end poverty across the globe
rather than attempting to help the poor
family by family, which does little to end
the globalization of poverty.
Jessica Sheldon 'O4, who will participate in the fall break project, said her
first impression of Kensington was one
of wasted resources. "I was most struck
by one avenue in particular that the city
had recently put $l7 million into for
renovation, and it now consists of an
abandonedbuilding, an empty lot, and a
liquor store," she said. "There are definitely resources out there to make a difference, but it's just not happening."
On Sunday, the participants in the
fall break project and others from KWRU
will travel to Washington, D.C. to participate in the World March of Women.
ETS will offer a workshop on the globalization of poverty in Kohlberg 116 tonight at 9 p.m.
In a separate education effort, KWRU
is hosting a one-day workshop for students in the Philadelphia area on Saturday at Temple University.

Packing it in for the presidential debate

BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
The Black Cultural Center's Collection series for the
2000-2001 school year kicked offlast Friday with a speech
by Dr. Ilaiyu Moses. The University ofNorth Carolina
professor spoke about black self-esteem and cultural
identity.
Moses began her presentation with a projected image of a small black boy looking at himself in the mirror. What he sees in the mirror, however, is neither his
own image nor a glorified version ofhimselfbut a strong
and smiling white Superman.
"A child should be able to envision a black superhero," Moses said. "Where are all the black superheroes
for our young men to model?"
She cited examples ofblack cultural identity that have
been stripped away over the centuries because of "the
idea that a dominant group should be imitated."
Moses emphasized that education at every level is
still largely Euro-centric and stressed that it is necessary for students ofAfrican descent learn to "accept an
Afro-centric identity and worldview" to counter what
they are taught in most of society.
The speaker listed various "coping strategies" employed by black college students in the educational ena posivironment and explained why "affirmation"
tive acceptance of one's own culture is the most effective method.

Following the speech was a question and answer session in which Moses answered questions on such subjects as Ebonics and the differences between white and

black culture today.

She told the audience that she sees a definite place
for all-black colleges in higher education and that, because of cultural differences, white parents should not
adopt black children.
Moses came to the college as part of a year-long program whose purpose is to underscore the importance of
supporting black students in the college environment.
In honor of the BCC's 30-year anniversary and
Swarthmore's longstanding tradition of graduating the
vast majority ofits black students, the program is called
"Season of Sankofa: Looking Back, Charging Ahead." It
will continue on Oct. 27 at 1 p.m. with "Supporting Black
Athletes," a speech by Jair Lynch.

But in order to keep its weekly

chose to nearly halve its formal parties budget from $2,000 to $1,200. And

general. He added that two-thirds
of group expenditures usually

occur during the spring semester; of the fall semester expenditures, only about one-third take
place before fall break.
"For some groups it probably
has hurt them and has made it
more difficult to run things," Student Council co-chair Jordan
Brackett 'Ol said. "For other
group there's just a little less of
everything. It makes things
tighter, but Swarthmore seems to
be functioning pretty well."

Fewer parties?
Like Barron, most group leaders interviewed said that they
did not yet know the extent to
whichthe cut would impact their
organizations. But several leaders were concerned that the partial loss of funding could substantially curtail their groups' activities and effectiveness.
SAC co-chair Rodney Morris
'Ol said the funding cut took
away about $750 from the party
budget. Since a basic party generally requires at least $2BO and
some parties can cost more than
$4OO, Morris said that SAC can
currently fund three "minimal"
or two more ambitious parties
per weekend. This does not include all-campus study breaks or
other smaller SAC-funded
events.

"It's manageable but we're

under strict budget constraints,"
Morris said. "We have to spend
a bit more cautiously than in the
past."

While some students have
commented on the dearth ofSACfunded parties so far this year,
both Morrisand Barron said this
is not a result of the funding cut.
"[The lack of parties has] not
been an issueof having too many
proposals and not being able to
fund them," Morris said. "It's
been an issue of not having
enough proposals."

Morris added that he does not
understand why there have been
fewer party proposals this year,
although he speculated that students may be concerned about li-

Large groups grapple with
spartan budget
The Forum for a Free Press,
which funds eight publications, including The Phoenix, Spike and several literary magazines, saw its budget drop from $46,000 to $37,000. Student Publications Coordinator Jeff
Heckelman 'O2 said he thought the
funding cut would have a greater
impact on the literary magazines,
most of which are already printing
the minimum 500 copies of their
publications. Since they cannot cut
circulation, such publications will
have to make adjustments elsewhere.
Liane Rice 'O3, treasurer of Small
Craft Warnings, said the magazine's
budget of $6,885
over $1,500 less
than its original request
is not

enough to publish both semesters at
the current level of quality. The
magazine switched printers last
year to get a better rate.
"We're pretty much at the lowest level before we have to dramatically change the format," Rice said.
Such changes could involve taking out the artwork or not using
perfect binding. But Small Craft
Warnings does not want to lower the
quality of the publication. "It's
pretty important to the community

that we have this," Rice said. She

hopes to work out an arrangement
with the printer that would allow
the magazine to publish at a lower
rate.
"If that doesn't work, I'm not
sure what we're going to do," she

said.
CIVIC, the umbrella organization for community service programs on campus, lost more than
$2,000 when its budget was cut from

$12,000 to $9,720.
"It's not life-or-death, but it's inconvenient," CIVIC treasurer Jen
Callaghan 'Ol said of the funding cut.
"[CIVIC] can't grow or develop as
easily as it could have without the

cut."

Callaghan said that the reduced
budget probably means that fewer
individual students will receive
funding. In the past, CrvlC has spent
$l,OOO to $1,200 on reimbursing indi-

vidual students for travel expenses
related to service activities.
In addition, the approximately 20
CIVIC groups will most likely receive less money for special projects,
such as the purchase tutoring supplies.

Drama Board, a group thatfunds

Student Budget Committee treasurer Marvin Barron gestures as he assists students with paperwork

year, it is too early to determine the effect of the 19 percent cut. But small groups are already struggling.
student theater productions, lost almost $3,000 from its "large budget,"
which comprises the bulk of its

funds.

Although board member Hilary
Rice 'O2, who served as treasurer
last year, said DramaBoard has not
yet been affected by the cut, this
could change during the spring semester, when the group tends to receive more proposals for produc-

tions.
"There's the possibility that we
will reach the point of having to decide whether to fund fewer shows or
give less funding to the shows that
we do fund," she said.
The 19 percent cut left Drama
Board with a large budget of $12,000.
The group's fixed costs, however,
include paying LPAC $1,300 for the
use of its facilities.
"If we do a musical and receive
two other proposals for plays, we'll
be getting into funding issues," Rice
said. We can't do three total productions because we don't have the
money for it."
Club sports, including men's and
women's rugby, ultimate frisbee and
men's volleyball, received $25,000
one of the largest portions of SBC
money. For women's rugby, which
originally budgeted for about $6,600
but received about $1,200 less, the
reduced allotment has necessitated
more time spent fundraising.
"It makes that much more of an
effort where we have to make up the
slack," treasurer Rabi Whitaker 'O3
said. The group currently charges
dues of $25, and team members must
buy part of their own uniforms.
Whitaker and Kate Fama 'Ol, who
served as treasurer last year, said
the funding cut also meant that the
team had to give up plans to buy a

new scrum machine, which it needs
both for practices and pre-game
warm-ups.

The Swarthmore College Computer Society lost about $BOO of the
approximately $4,300 that it was
originally allocated. According to

system

administrator Nick
Ouellette 'O2, the budget cut has
forced the group to scramble to come
up with funds for one of its top priorities: the purchase of a new web
server with more disk space and a
system for preventing the kind of
data loss that occurred this summer.
Small groups hurt most
But the funding cut seems to
have had the most dramatic effect
for groups withsmall budgets in the
rather than the thouhundreds
sands of dollars.
Representatives from these
groups said, like SPC, their activities are being stifled by the funding
cut.
Just Cause, a newly-chartered
activist group that works on issues
involving the criminal justice system, received $l4B for the year after
the 19 percent cut.
"It's not enough to do what we
wantto do in terms of education on
campus," group leader Chela
Delgado 'O3 said. "It's really going
to put us under strain this year."
Treasurer Hang Le 'O3 said that
Just Cause will have to find alternate strategies for running campuswide campaigns, which make up a
large component of the group's activities. Instead of poster and fliers,
which proved effective last spring,
the group will try writing on paths
with sidewalk chalk and making
banners from sheets.
Le also said that since 15 to 30

students attend her group's
weekly meetings, Just Cause
should receive more than $l4B,
which is over $lOO less than the
SAF paid by one student. "I feel
that it's very unfair for students
to pay [the SAF] in their tuition
bill and not be able to use it in
groups on campus," she said.
Allen also expressed doubts
about whether the cuts were fair
to groups that, like SPC, have
small, no-frills budgets.
But Barron maintained that
the cuts were equitable for all
groups involved since they were
made across the board. "I don't
see how would they wouldsuffer
more," Barron said of groups
with small budgets.
Brackett also felt that the decision to cut 19 percent from all
budgets rather than not replenish the capital replacement fund
or cut some groups completely
was "the lesser of several evils."
But leaders of small-budget
groups also argue that the cut
leaves no room for creating new
programs based on student interests. "Right now it's very difficult
because all these ideas are coming that pretty much have to be
shot downbecause we don'thave
the funds," Le said.
Allen, who had hoped to reach
out to the queer community at
Swarthmore, said, "I would like
to bring in someone who is gay
or lesbian and ordained clergy,
but where am I going to get the
money for it?"
Barron said that there was
some money available in a discretionary fund for movies,

Listen up, SBC
On the surface,

it doesn't seem like student

Wrong. Sure, the biggest groups

nothing we can do now, right?
Wrong again. Last year, as it became apparent
that drastically raising the Student Activities Fee
(SAF) was the only way to pull the Student Activities
Fund out of dire financial straits, Student Budget
Committee (SBC) seemed to fall into disarray. The
committee dropped any pretense of long-range
planning and became an intensely political body.
The debacle culminated in a poorly conducted

RU-486 keeps abortion safe and legal
Dear Editor:
Ted Chan was right about it being difficult not to offend someone by his article, "RU-486 not the wonder pill it's
made out to be" (Oct. 5). I hope I wasn't
the only person offended by his assertion that the issue most men would be
thinking about was the price of RU-486,
or that a 92 percent to 96 percent effectiveness rate was "like playing Russian
roulette with your body."
That aside, he left out a few importantpoints concerning safety. No one has
ever died from the use of mifepristone.
First approved in France in 1988, it has
since been approved by over 20 countries. After extensive research, the FDA
approved it by letter in 1996. Since then,
the final debate has centered on restrictions and production, both of whichhave
now been adequately addressed.
Pro-choice or pro-life, we can agree
that abortions should be safe. Medical
abortions are equally as safe as surgical
abortions. But they can be performed

earlier and without invasive surgery,
anesthesia, risk of uterine perforation,
or injury to the cervix. Furthermore,
they are less psychologically damaging
because they avoid dealing withprotestors such as Reverend John Earl, who
attacked the Northern Illinois Women's
Center with an axe this September.
Mifepristone is also used as a treatment for breast cancer, endometriosis,
glaucoma, meningioma, ovarian cancer,
and prostate cancer. In a study by Dr.
David Weiner, mifepristone reduced the
production of HIV by infected cells by
70 percent; as a cortisol-blocker,
mifepristone combats depression, anorexia nervosa, ulcers, diabetes,
Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, and
Alzheimer's.
So why does mifepristone make abortion safer? About 50 percent of the time,
pregnancy is terminated within 4 hours
of the first dose, giving the patient time
to return home. Bleeding and spotting
similar to a heavy period continue for

nine to 16 days, and the aborted cells
are smaller than a grain of rice (this

is what Ted Chan refers to as "handling" the fetus).
Mifepristone, in contrast to
Chan's assertion, actually combats
the use of black-market abortion
pills. Cytotec, an ulcer pill known as
the "star pill" due to its shape, is used
in abortion clinics in conjunction
with Methotrexate as an alternative
to surgical abortion. However, it has
become an increasingly popular
black-market pill among women who
are afraid to seek out safe, legal surgical abortion.
Although better than a coat
hanger or iodine, Cytotec can lead to
hemorrhaging, incomplete abortions, and premature deliveries.
While Mifeprex won't affect the number of abortions performed, it will
help to fight the use of dangerous,
illegal abortion methods.

increase.
This doesn't necessarily mean SBC completely
screwed up. If you ignore the bumbling that came
before the committee's decision, the 19 percent
across-the-board cut makes sense it was, after all,
the only option available to them at the time. But
current students have unfortunately been saddled
with the onerous task of making up for three or four
years of deficit spending, all for the sake of the
students who will be here three or four years from
now.
Whether the committee actually was or not, it
certainly appeared as if SBC was blindsided by the
revelation that it was in the red and still deficit
spending. This year, SBC knows it is in an uncomfortable situation. This year, there's no reason why
SBC shouldn't be doing what it should have done last
year: serve the students.
Rather than clamming up and emerging with a
surprising decision sometime in April, SBC should
start paying attention to what the student body
wants now, which means asking. And asking
honestly, accurately and apolitically.
Nobody actually knows whether students would
prefer to pay a lower SAF and have less activities, or
to pay a higher SAF and have more activities. We
certainly don't, and neither does SBC. Last year's
SBC "survey," which presented the student body
with options without fully explaining the consequences and was worded to make the committee's
preference appear the most attractive, didn't
determine how students truly felt about the issue. Of
course people are going to prefer paying less money
if no one explains to them how the money is used.
Had the survey truly gauged student opinion,
students might not be dealing with a 19 percent cut
today.
This year, SBC should do the responsible thing:
Present the information regarding the SAF and the
various consequences of changing it to the student
body as fairly and objectively as possible, then allow
the students to decide what to do. And just as
importantly, it should do that now, when making a
decision actually means something.
The SAF is going to increase next year, but at this
Point, almost all the additional revenue generated by
the increase will go directly into the capital replacement account, where it won't be spent on current
student activities. That's not the issue: the issue is
whether we should raise the SAF even more to
restore, or even to increase, current student activities funding.
SBC needs to stop paying lip service to the idea
that it serves the student body and to start doing just
that. The committee should find out what the
students really want, and it should find out now,
before the student body gets a bad deal this year as
well.

Controversy over Napster a moral dilemma
BY ANDY KARR
I remember having a confused, negative reaction to James Q. Wilson's talk last year
about "moral intuitions." After letting the argument unpack itself in my mind since, I see
he tried to combat some of the recent questioning of the academy's authority from within
the academy itself, and did so in a very reactionary way (duh).
I do have these twinges ofconscience he calls "moral intuitions," but I didn'tknow why.
I have since decided that most of our intuitions are nurture, not nature, though I don't
have scientific evidence. I remember intuitively thinking that his scientific reasoning was
also somewhat questionable.
Now I realize that he was emphasizing the scientific part ofhis argument to combat the
questioning of authority, which bothered him. By making these "moral intuitions" seem
based in our biological makeup, he discourages the whole line of questioning.
I concluded this about his talk from practical, not theoretical, considerations. I like
Napster. I use Napster. Getting almost any song I want within minutes of realizing I want
it but don't have it is nice. Napster makes me feel happy.
But Napster also makes me feel guilty. I don't feel bad about ripping off the greedy
entertainment industry. They continue to rip me off on a daily basis, as they have for
years. But I feel like I'm ripping off artists, and I respect artists more than anyone else.
I'm not above questioning my beliefs when I feel guilty about something. Maybe that
makes me a hypocrite, but that's OK. We all do it, whether we like to admit it or not.
So I thought about my beliefs, Napster and ripping offartists. I believe artists deserve
compensation for their work more than anyone else in capitalism. There's also that famous and variously attributed quote about artists: "Any artist who tells you she's not in it
for the money is a liar." On the other side are those who believe art is above the exchange
of money. These people accuse popular bands of selling out. I have sympathy with both

NAPSTER MAKES ME FEEL HAPPY. BUT NAPSTER ALSO MAKES

sides.
Is the controversy over Napster so simple? Despite what Lars and Dre say, they only
took Napster to court when it hit them where ithurts: in the purse. The greedy entertainment industry also quickly joined them in court, immediately making me suspicious, as
I'm made suspicious of all who jump on the anti-Napster bandwagon, whether they act
through the courts, Napster bans or questionable decisions not to keep up with technology, such as refusing to purchase more bandwidth. I see the anti-Napster crowd as acting
out of some combination of intemperate self-interest and Ludditism.
A few intelligent recording artists (notably Courtney Love, Billy Corgan and the artist
once again known as Prince) have agreeable thoughts about Napster. Here's my view,
influenced by what they said.
The Internet is changing entertainment (duh). In the long run, file sharing can't be
stopped. Those opposing Napster are greedy or reactionary or both. The best thing for
artists to do is roll with the punches and find ways to capitalize on new technology. Clinging to the old structure only makes you look like an old fogey.
So I don't feel guilty about Napster any more. When I like aCD, I still go out and buy it,
out of pure materialism, if not guilt. I like to have the actual CD it feels more authentic.
Perhaps the controversy over Napster will not only change the economics and politics
of entertainment, but will also shed light on the old question: art for art's sake or art for
putting-food-on-the-table's sake?

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

College's bandwidth problems
more complex than reported
Dear Editor:
Beyond some simple textual errors (why "kbps" but "Mb/s"?), there are
deeper problems with The Phoenix's report on the college's new bandwidth
shaper ("Download speed may rise slightly," Oct. 5).
One of the biggest problems is the presumption that all bandwidth problems students are having are caused by the bandwidth shaper locally. This
simply is not true, never has been and probably never will be. These problems did develop over the course of the summer, but for a drastically different reason.
The college's bandwidth was formerly provided by Enter.net (that's the
provider where we had a theoretical-but-not-solid ceiling of 10 Mbps for the
three colleges). In buying a hard-limited 10 Mbps for Swarthmore alone, we
changed providers to Yipes! (yes, the exclamation point is part of their name.
Blame Yahoo!.). Asidefrom the somewhatscary name ("Yipes! The network's
out again!"), Yipes! touches with a different set of upstream providers than
Enter.net did, which means that access to certain sections of the Internet
are routed differently (and often less efficiently).
This is not to say that Enter.net was any shining star; they had great
difficulty actually keeping their router between the college and the rest of
the world up, which was the reason local traffic would be fine and external
traffic dead for a span of several hours periodically last school year. But
when our connection was alive, their backbone connections were far
speedier, especially to locations served by backbone providers on the west
coast, than the current connection.
Even with service provider problems aside, students need to remember
that the reason a web page loads or an MP3 downloads slowly might well be
that the server on the other end is overloaded (or on a slower connection)
and is doing the best it can to shovel data to them.
Second, I sincerely hope that Judy Downing's and Marc Dumic's comments about there being "no port blocking" to campus were taken severely
out of context. If not, they are flat-out lies. Any student with access to a
computer outside of Swarthmore's campus can verify this for themselves
by portmapping a host within the Swarthmore network. They will find that
most incoming ports are filtered (which means subjectively blocked) especially including services frequently vulnerable to network attack (DNS,
SMTP, POP3, NetBUI, so forth). But that is a good thing.
Two years ago, a cracker broke into a student's insufficiently secured
computer and, from there, gathered passwords for user accounts on various machines around campus including the servers belonging to the computing center (now ITS), the computer science program, and SCCS. Over
the summer, changes were made to the college's firewall that make this
kind of attack much more difficult.
Finally, for all ITS's reassurances that 128 kbps is a lot of bandwidth
(and it really is; most students would be hard-pressed to max that out on a
regular basis), Dumic's statement that it's "much larger than anything going into someone's house" is becoming less and less true. Dual B-channel
ISDN lines are not unheard-of in small offices, and xDSL, quite common in
the greater Philadelphia area, offers download rates up to 768 kbps at a
reasonable rate ($5O per month or so) and L 5 Mbps for not much more ($BO
per month, which is not very much when split among several roommates).

IC groups clarify policies
Dear Editor:
We, the board members ofthe Intercultural Center (IC) Groups, are writing in response to the article written by Matt Rubin entitled "Support
Groups Should Alter Admission Requirements"
(Sept. 28). We are not writing to agree or disagree
with Rubin, but after reading his article we did feel
it necessary for each of the IC support groups to
clarify their individual stances on the issueof support group admission requirements. Rubin only interviewed the Director of the Black Cultural Center (BCC) and used his interpretation of this interview to make a blanket statement about all support groups. We stress that each organization has
its own stance on the issue, which we now present.
HOLA: The Hispanic Organization for Latino
Awareness (HOLA) as of now is open to students
who identify themselves as Latinos or Hispanics.
Our first purpose is to provide a space for Latinos
on campus to come together, but we also make it a
point to provide open meetings and events to educate the entire campus aboutLatino culture, issues
and concerns. We are always open to suggestions
from all individuals on campus and are eager to
answer any inquiries about our organization.
NASA: The Native American Student Association (NASA) has a unique role on campus in that
itis an open support group with no requirements
whatsoever for membership, except the desire to
learn about Native American culture. We seek to
provide a forum to facilitate discussionand awareness of issues unique to the native community and
its place withinmainstream society. Our goals are
primarily educational in nature and we actively
encourage everyone on campus to attendall of our
meetings (Tuesdays, 8 p.m. in the IC) and events.
SAO: The Swarthmore Asian Organization's
(SAO) mission is to build a community among and
provide a forum for students who self-identify as
Asian, Asian-American, or Pacific Islander. The
organization's primary purpose is to serve these
students who self-identify. While the article's primary concern is membership criteria based along
racial lines, SAO does not have standards for
self-identification, and thus, membership. Rather,
members may self-identify along racial, ethnic or
cultural lines. For example, a white student who
grew up in Asia may self-identify along cultural
lines. However a student self-identifies, the board
is there to serve the student.
In regard to events being open or closed, the majority of events SAO sponsors are already open to

the whole community. These events are usually cultural and educational in purpose, including documentary showings, alumni lectures, trips to Philadelphia or coffeehouses. General meetings, on the
other hand, are generally topic-discussion oriented,
and therefore, closed to members in order to provide a comfortable discussion atmosphere.
SQU: As the Swarthmore Queer Union (SQU)
is not an organization that is specific to racial issues, most ofRubin's article was not applicable to
SQU. However, our organization would like to
clarify our position about open/closed meetings.
SQU's Wednesday night meetings at 10 p.m. are
generally closed because there are many queer and
questioning students who are not comfortable or
do not wish to have their sexual orientation known
outside of the organization. Our closed meetings
provide a safe and confidential space for such students. However, this year, SQU does intend to hold
at least one open SQU meeting a month for those
who are interested. And as always, the
Queer-Straight Alliance (QSA) is open to all and
meets Thursdays at 10 p.m. Our upcoming Coming Out Week (Oct. 22-28) events are open to all
campus, and our Intercultural Center movie
nights, lectures, coffeehouses and roundtables are
always open to all.
To reiterate, all IC events aside from SAO,
HOLA and SQU's weekly meetings are open to the
entire campus. And to further clarify, we will restate the IC's mission: The Intercultural Center
provides support to Asian/Asian-American, Hispanic/Latino/a, Native American and queer students at Swarthmore College, ensuring a safe space
for these students through IC-affiliated support
groups. These support groups include SAO, HOLA,
NASA and SQU. Additionally, the IC seeks to educate both its members and the community at large
about cultural, ethnic, class, gender and sexualorientation differences. The IC commits necessary
resources and services toward increasing awareness about issues that pertain to IC-affiliated students.
Finally, the IC attempts to enhance the growth
of multiculturalism and interculturalism at
Swarthmore College. The IC organizes campuswide events, funds Cooper Proposals and creates
alliances with other student organizations, administration and faculty to build, increase and maintainrespect for differences and diversity at all levels of campus life.

A PRO AND

Hunt reveals social divisions

A CON

So I was initially going to write this really heartwarmabout how Swatties don't extend the Quaker
rhetoric of inclusiveness to the otherend of the popularity spectrum, namely the Swarthmore Warders of Imaginative Literature (SWIL). I was going to self-righteously
rant about how the rest of us should be more inclusive.
But then I went to the Pterodactyl Hunt.
And let me tell you, social Darwinism doesn't seem as
ruthlessly immoral when applied to social adeptness.
Some background: After listening to people make snide
remarks about SWIL for three years, I decided to prove to
the world that they were just like every other Swattie:
mildly socially inept, whiny and insecure. Ergo, I decided
to do some undercover reporting for The Phoenix by attending the SWIL Pterodactyl Hunt.
So I dragged a friend who was interested in participating in the Hunt like a seven-year-old boy is interested in
seeing if girls really have cooties. We were so late that I
was immediately confused by the setup.
From what I observed, this guy in a cape who is referred to as "The Wizard" was handing out white trash
bags and rolled-up newspapers to a lot of white people in
a crammed room. "The Wizard" then told us to use the
newspapers to hit anything wearing a black trash bag,
and not to worry, because anything wearing a black trash

bag was really just a monster. I wasn't sure if I was at a
Pterodactyl Hunt or a restaging of "Birth of a Nation."
Woefully unclear, we formed a team with two other gogetters and a veteran general of Pterodactyl Hunts. We followed our veteran by basically beating the crap out of any-

ing story

LET ME TELL YOU, SOCIAL DARWINISM
DOESN'T SEEM AS RUTHLESSLY IMMORAL
WHEN APPLIED TO SOCIAL ADEPTNESS.

thing that seemed to know what was going on.
In the simplest terms, my team earned gold from the
Riddler while avoiding the Cat to buy a silver sword that
could repeatedly kill the Werewolf to buy several shields
that would allow us to kill the Guards of the Pterodactyl
which would, in turn, allow us to get enough gold to buy a
dactyl license which would allow us to use a Supersoaker
to take out the Pterodactyl, who would then give us the
pendant which we would exchange at the store for glory
and a precious Renato's pizza.

Got that?
Me either, but trust me, it doesn't matter. So eventually
my team attacked the Pterodactyl, and we even got the pendant. And just as we were about to turn it in, The Wizard
showed up with The Guard. They said that since we didn't
knock out both wings, we didn't actually win the pendant.

I protested, in super-debater bitch mode, that the Pterodactyl had given it to us and that it was HER fault and that
was just too bad.
Alas, we were overruled and quit in frustration soon
thereafter. But, lo! I say unto you, Swarthmore, the REAL
champions (de facto, perhaps not legally or technically) of
the Pterodactyl Hunt are Ambrose "The General" Dieringer
'Ol, Rachel "Biblical Judith" Stein 'Ol, Cathy "Ninja"
Vaughan 'Ol, Erica "Vanguard" Anderson 'Ol and John "Outside Voices" Dolan 'Ol
After the anger of being robbed of the glory of being
SWIL champion subsided, I recanted my Quakerly inclusiveness for SWIL. Think about it.
If they won't bow to social pressure in a tough situation
(like the pendant issue), in order to be "right" and "fair"
and other irrelevant terms in this age ofmoral ambiguity,
then they deserve all the social, nay, popularity Darwinism the rest of this microcosm can muster to eradicatethenway of life. Because Swillies aren't like you and me: they
aren't insecure about climbing up the socialladder or seeming cool, they are confident enough to accept their shortcomings and social ineptness, and, most distinct from the
rest of us, they are willing to accept those unlike them with

PART ONE OF TWO:
kind of moral system
A REPUBLICAN'S

Sometimes I find it fun to look at college materials for prospective students. It's something about the
contrast between how nerve-racking and important
everything seemed before compared to how funny,
misrepresentative and usually unimportant it is now.
Honestly, how important does the number of volumes in the library compared to other schools seem
now? But the quality of food in the dining hall, that's
another story altogether.
As I was indulging in this pastime the other night,
however, I noticed one of these college ratings that
struck a real chord with me. According to the
Princeton Review, we students rank ourselves as the
school where students are the 19th "Most Likely to
Ignore God on a Regular Basis."
Yes, I realize how ridiculously stupid and misleading the wording of this ranking is. Nevertheless, ever
since I read this ranking on Kol Nidre, one of the
holiest nights of the Jewish year, its implied sentiment resonated within me and got me thinking about
its truth. As I reflected on my timehere, I concluded
that yes, from my view, this campus is a lot less religious than most others.
But more important than the accuracy of this
ranking is what impact this non-religious atmosphere has on and what it reveals about the lives of
Swarthmore students.
On one hand, it might be a wonderful example of
the true open-mindedness ofSwatties. Many do consider religion to be rigid and confining, an "opiate of
the masses" (as we have heard too many times in too
many classes) that creates an ethical system for
people who ought develop this system for themselves.
While I disagree with this characterization ofreligion, to think that many students forgo a set religious
conception ofmorality for a dynamic one entirely their
own is, in many ways, an encouraging reaffirmation
of our open-mindedness and individuality.
Religion is admittedly less necessary on a campus not suffering a lack-of-morals crisis. On other
campuses with a much more active religious life, students are often much more devoid of social morals.
For example, I visited the University ofMaryland
this past weekend, a campus on which religious
groups made the front page of the paper for their
events and discussions. Yet when I told people I
planned to major in philosophy, three separate people
responded, "How are you going to make money with
that?" When I answered that I just wanted to learn
and maybe teach someday, they replied that they
needed to make more money than that. One even
said, in reference to me, of all people, "This kid has
morals and shit." But I digress.
Despite the apparent harmlessness of this school's
rampant atheism and agnosticism, it is easy to forget that there are some very religious students on
campus. In my time here, I have noticed many students dismiss religion as something far-fetched and
illogical.
I think I am safe in assuming that religious justifications, while accepted in our spirit of "tolerance,"
are usually not viewed to be as convincing as more
systematic arguments. Religious arguments are often just not accepted.
This veiled disapproval of religion evidenced at
times on campus is itselfunacceptable. Students who
are open-minded enough to conceive of their own
moral system should also be equally accepting ofothers', whether or not they are religious in nature.
I do not mean this to come across in any way as
an indictment. Rather, I hope that some of you, by
reading this, will understand that, no matter how
concealed it is, your refusal to give equal weight to
religion and, say, objective logic, is visible.
While such thinking is your prerogative and does
exhibit tolerance, it does not exhibit full acceptance.

Tolerance and acceptance are very different, and until we learn to accept what we tolerate, our tolerance
will be nothing more than a politically correct facade.

LOOK AT THE RACE
FOR THE PRESIDENT
AND ITS EFFECTS ON
OUR GENERATION.
BY DAVID THOMAS
Sometimes it's hard to get
excited about a presidential
election, especially when you
are 18 to 22 years old and enrolled in college. It is difficult
to see what effect, if any, the
next president will have on
your life tomorrow or farther
down the road. You don't care
because you think it doesn't
matter who wins; after all, is
there really any difference?
It's true, presidential nominees George Bush and Al Gore
do have some very similar stances, and each one does enjoy the
status quo. No matter who wins, a lot of things will stay the
same. But there are some major differences between the two,
especially in their views on Social Security and their general
relationships with "the People." These differences may not matter tomorrow or even next year. But they have some serious
implications down the road for all of us.
First, Social Security. Gore favors the idea of a lock-box,
which essentially means that we won't change anything. No
changes in benefits or taxes or costs, the status quo. This would
be fine, except for the mounting evidence that the social security system is in trouble and could go bankrupt anywhere between 2015 and 2050, depending on the state of the economy.
For once, it is the Republican who recognizes the need for a
change. A system that is going bankrupt cannot be patched up
through fancy accounting. It must be fundamentally changed,
or no one in college now will ever see a dime of the money they

RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR A CHANGE.

ACCOUNTING.
have paid in to the social security system. Either benefits will
have to be reduced, or payments increased, or both.
Bush's plan for investing part of that payment (around two
percent) into your own account may sound strange at first, but
think about it. If, instead of paying into the Social Security trust
fund with a return of two percent, everyone bought U.S. treasury bills paying five percent, they would more than double
their money. This can even be done without risk, because the
only way for T-bills to default is if the government defaults; try
getting your Social Security then.
Not only will the return be better for everyone, but for lowerincome families it is even more
profitable. Since richer people live
longer than poorer people, on average, the rich collect Social Security longer. If everyone had his own
account, a worker who died at age
64 he could pass on all the money
he had saved to his children to help
put his grandchildren through college.

The current system does not allow for this flexibility. Once you
die, your spouse can collect some,
but not all, of your benefits and

Heather Doyle For The Phoenix

your children over the age of 18 get nothing. In fact, for
the poorest fifth of the country, Social Security actually

has a negative return.
The second point is more general, but possibly just as
important. Education, this election's most important issue, is a perfect example. There is a fundamental difference in the way the two candidates look at the problem
and the solution. For Gore, the solution to the problem is
government. His philosophy seems to be, "if we just throw
more money at the problem, it will go away," despite the
fact that almost every study shows that while this country has been spending more and more on education, the
scores have been getting worse and worse.
Bush's theory is that the best way to improve education is to get parents more involved by giving them choice.
Choice over schools, curriculum, even teachers to a certain extent. By getting parents more involved in these
choices, you get them more involved in their children's
day-to-day education, which is the best way to improve
education. Get parents involved and hold schools accountable forresults. I would sum it up this way: For Gore, the
solution lies with government; for Bush, it lies with parents. For Gore, education should be driven by the needs
of teachers; for Bush, the needs of students.
The choice between Bush and Gore may seem unimportant but it will have major implications for the direction of this country for a long time to come in at least
some areas. Do we trust people to have the solutions, or
do we trust government? Who can better manage your
life: you, or Al Gore's Washington?

TALENT THAT ALLOWS ONE TO
MOCK WITH IMMUNITY

LIVING
0 Bob Gross, 1962
Armed with charm and an
itchy curiosity, Jonah Gold
sought that rarity of
encounters: a tete-a-tete
with Dean of the College
Bob Gross '62. "When I
think back on my life as a
student here, there's a fair
amount of irony in me being
the dean," says Gross.
So, uh, you're the dean. Is it fun?
Most of the time. I had a friend who once said that he
finds his job so much fun that most of the time he'd do it
for nothing. So he saves his salary for the other moments.
And I would say that's by and large true.
Now this may be a stupid question, but what does
a dean do?
I think I have sort of general oversight of the programs
and circumstances that the students encounter outside of
their academic life, and also responsibility for the progress
of individual students. This includes social life, academic
life things like the health center and [the Career Planning and Placement Office] report to the dean. And in terms
of how I spend my time, some of it is meeting with staff
members, some with individual students, meetings, a lot
of committees, and a fair amount of hanging out and
...

schmoozing.

What constitutes "schmoozing" exactly?
With students. I make it a point of eating in Tarble and
Sharpies. Tarble, mostly to kind of meet with colleagues,
and Sharpies for students. I like mostly walking through
Parrish, Parrish Beach.... It's a way of seeing people who
don't find their way into my office.
Do you have any thoughts on the upcoming election?
I always find it, every four years, both exciting and
scary. I have strong political views, so it's kind of nervewracking. I'm always surprised by people who are undecided. It seems sort of naive or short-sighted not to have
clear political views. I had my first election party, probably about 1960, when I was a student here. And I've had
one every election year ever since.
Has the election night scene changed much since
then?
Well, when I think of waiting until seven o'clock in the
morning to find out the results in 1960.... Nowadays, the
results are announced as soon as the polls close, sometimes
sooner. But the thrill is still there. I was glad to see the big
turnout for the debates in Parrish Parlours. I'm pleased to
see there is so much interest on campus.
Do you know any good jokes?
None that I'd want printed in The Phoenix.
What song is in your head right now?
"Stairway to Heaven." I just saw "Almost Famous" this
weekend. Thought it was great. And supposedly Cameron
Crowe, in his life, was touring with Led Zeppelin.
If you could tour with any rock band, who would it
be?
I guess I would have gone with the Dead
if
Well
they were still touring. Unfortunately, I became a deadhead
long after the days when it was feasible for me to go touring with them had passed.
Are you a fan of "Star Trek"?
I sort of was an original William Shatner-Leonard
Nimoy fan. When it got to the Next Generation, and the
generation after that, it just got too hard to keep up.
You just answered my next question before I asked it.
Are you psychic? I mean, do you have any form of
extrasensory perception?
Just a trained therapist.
What is your favorite non-academic pastime for which
there is no team, club, or organization at Swat?
Depends how you define organization. I guess I would
say cooking, and while we do have a dining hall, there's
not a student organization. And I sometimes think that
that's a course we should have here.
A cooking course?

Well, we can't exactly call it Home Ec anymore. But I
learned to cook when I was a student here. Sunday nights,
supper was always horrible, and we used to have a copy of
"Joy of Cooking" in the library, and I used to check it out
and make something in the dorms.
As long as we're on the subject of food
do you like
salt and vinegar potato chips?
I do, but I don't eat many potato chips. I'm more a

Swat, who would it be?

I'd sort ofbe interested in talking with

What cartoon character do you most

I'll just let it stand at that.... Actually,
it depends on my mood. Sometimes I feel
like a character from R. Crumb. Are you
familiar with R. Crumb?
Yeah, a little bit.
[He shows me a comicbook. It is cool.]
How many times have you seen "The
Big Lebowski"?
Only once. I would not mind seeing
it again, because I loved it. And I was
very impressed that the orientation
committee picked it as their theme.
Describe your wackiest college memory
from your days here at Swat.
my wackiest college
Oh wow
memory... (Thinks) Well, there was the
time that we tried to create a sauna in
Roberts, and closed the door in our private bath and turned the water on, and
then went rolling in the snow. I don't
think I'd do that again
Did it work?
Worked? Yeah, it did. But that rolling in the snow is not all
it's cracked up to be.... There are plenty of good stories, but
they're not befitting my image as a dean.
C'mon. You can tell me.
Only off the record, Jonah... A couple years ago I ran into
the deanwho was dean when I was a student, Dean Prentice.
And I was very excited to see him, and I said "Dean Prentice!
I'm sitting in your office now." And he kind of looked at me
sideways, and said "How interesting for you." ... When I think
back on my life as a student here, there's a fair amount of
irony in me being the dean.
What are some of your favorite words in the English
language?
I always hear that "cellar-door" was one of the most beautiful sounding words.
Where did you hear that?
Where? I don't know, but supposedly the sibylline 's' with
the soft T's and the Y with the little fricative 'd', it supposedly makes it very euphonious. But content-wise

Well, I guess if the purpose of this interview is for people
to get a rounder sense of who I am and what's important to

Do you want to talk about your family?
Yeah. I do. I've been married 35 years, and my wife is

was a little too close to home. One of them is in medical
school ... and my younger daughter is a professor in Savannah and the mother of my first granddaughter.... I
see my roles as husband and father and grandfather as a

In comparison

with the awe-inspiring undergarment choices that women
in our society must make, we guys
have it easy. Men's underwear is, essentially, pretty boring. But there is excitement of some kind or another to be found
in the fact that regardless of whether or not
we care, we still have to wear one or the
other. "Boxers or briefs?" is the question.
Which one is superior? Which one is i
sexier? Which one would Jesus wear? \
And, most importantly, who cares?
Most guys certainly don't. I formally refute the "Underwear
Jihad" theory. As the
results of my
extensive scientific survey (encompassing me, my roommate, and a couple
people down the hall) show, heterosexual males think
about their own gender's underwear about as often as
they run out of clean pairs. If there are burning issues
here, they're well hidden. The boxer-wearers and the
brief-wearers are not at all at war.
Ifthey were, though, boxers wouldbe winning, at least
popularity-wise. They're available with prettier pictures,
better corporate slogans, more materials and are less
likely to reduce sperm count, though I have yet to hear a
good explanation from a non-middle-school student on
why this is a good thing. So, obviously, boxers are the
best. Yay, boxers!
On the other hand, though less mainstream with the
"hip" college-age audience, briefs do have their proponents. They have sex appeal when worn by Marky Mark
or Harrison Ford, they are less wont to slippage (please
do not ask me why I know this) and they are a practical
necessity for recent recipients of several major genital
piercings. And you never know when that will come in
handy. Briefs are just sooo much cooler. Yay, briefs!
Comfort-wise, who knows? Brief-wearers swear that
their tighty-whities (or gray-ies, or blue-ies) are more
comfortable than wearing shorts underneath pants could
ever be. Boxers-wearers, of course, disagree, and then
troublemakers start to argue that "au naturel" is better
than either, and then it just gets ugly.
Finally, it, like the Mac-PC controversy or the KirkPicard wars, turns into one of those big, silly debates in
which all sides' arguments boil down to "I just like itbet-

looked when I looked at underwear. If panties were
not adorned with obvious cherry images, then they were
garnished with images reminiscent ofcherries small, globule-esque, sensuously red figures. Why cherries? What does it
all mean?
The phenomenology of the cherry is essential to put on the back
burner of our minds when analyzing cherry-laden panties. The
plucking of the cherries the gentle rustle of the branch when you
tug on the ripening fruit, the soft pop of the stem, giving way to the
force of a pull. Furthermore, we think of the feel of a cherry in our
hands
the smooth texture of the tough yet supple skin of the
fruit, its fullness, its yielding. Then, we place the red fruit on our
tongues
the feeling of the cherry filling our mouths, the fullbodied tartness of the taste, the tantalizingly sweet juices on our
lips and we bite down, revealing the fruit's richly pinked pulp.
And this is the experience we associate, albeit unconsciously,
with the image of a cherry on a pair of panties.
Certainly, the phenomenological aspects of the cherry are
not all we consider when we see cherried panties. We see the
cherry in its "entirety" shrouded in layers of social discourse.
We think of the cherry as a metaphor for a loss of virginity.
(How long have you been waiting to read that line?) Or, we relate the image of the cherry with the notion offeminine fertility
fruit, woman, womb, sex. These notions are further involuted
when we take into account the almost cannibalistic language we
employ when expressing affection to one another: "You are so terribly sweet," or "Oooh, I could just eat you up." The discourse almost drips off our tongues and into our understanding of the panties,
sven if it is without our knowledge.
And, yes, lingerie companies are aware of the semiotics of panties

I can tell just by looking at her
that she's wearing a thong. She's the
kind of woman who'd wear one,
even while she scrubbed the toilet.
She's all legs and breast, her body
supported by veritable stilts, her
chest protruding like two massive
cannons on her small frame. She
smoothes her short skirt under her
perfectly sculpted figure and crosses
her legs, glancing coolly around the
room, eyebrow arched high above
her dark glasses.
I was wrong, though. This isn't

Choose your undies wisely
BY ERICA CARTMILL
Often, my morning ritual consists of falling out of bed and into a pile of my not-yet-putand slugging my way into whatever happens to be on the top layer. But on days
when I do manage a basic human level ofmorning neural impulses, I stand facing my dresser
iway laundry

md the piles of clothes on the floor in front of if and wonder: what kind of day do I want it to
3e? Perhaps I have an exam or a quiz. Maybe I have a presentation or even a "hot" lunch date
it Sharpies. After assessing the hurdles and challenges that will confront me, I fece the first
xuly important decision of the day: what type of underwear to put on.
It is very much an "Indiana Jones and the Holy Grail" moment "choose wisely, my son"
-uns though my head as my hand hovers over the sacred top drawer and decides who I will be
:hat day. I know that my holey "granny" panties will provide me with comfort as I squirm in
:he chair during my exam. Understated cotton Jockeys will support me as I race through anDther day at Swarthmore. A good power thong will seamlessly slide between me and my inhiaitions, reminding me that an unwillingness to budge can become a real pain after a while,
the closest to myself— when I go without the
told I'll admit that I feel the least restricted
trappings of underwear altogether.
Choice of underwear affects not only what clothes you decide to layer on top, but also the
way you see and choose to present yourself. And this is differentfor men and women.
Pete McKee 'O3 said, "It's not so much the underwear that affects the mood, it's the mood
that determines the underwear." He then recanted slightly by admitting that he's had a few
lays when a bad choice ofunderwear significantly changed his outlook.'!might have to squirm
around in class all day and with everyone looking at me, but hey, the guy needs; to breathe," he
said. The men I interviewed agreed that for them, the most important factor in selection is
comfort.
Women seem to be more influenced by the visual component of their lingerie. A salesperson at an area underwear outlet explained, "Most women come in and want something to feel
pretty. They consider their underwear to be for themselves, to give them confidence [and]
make them feel pretty and attractive." Cyndi Leger 'O3 confirmed the remark. "Dude, I feel so
much hotter when Pm wearing a thortg!"
The knowledge of what our underwear looks like affects our demeanor whether or not we
expect anyone to see it. "I always base my underwear choice on who I'm going to be around
that day, whether they'll see my underwear or not," Leger said
Even if we feign indifference, the potentialfor having an audience lingers in the back of our
minds. "I mean, if you're going to have any possibility of someone seeing you in your underwear, you don't want to get caught in your Bambi boxers," Andy Alderete 'O2 said.
to make us feel strong, sexy or comfortable. But like

Thursday night after watching "Nanjing 1937," I just shook director Wu Ziniu's hand and walked out, with no rational thoughts in
my head.

I did however, have many irrational ones. Like how much I hated
the Japanese at that moment.
White people who don'tknow better think all Asians are cool with
one another and chill and eat rice in SAO together. It's hardly the
case.
Yeah, I hated the Japanese when I was a kid. I was taught to,
conditioned like Pavlov's dogs.
Ironically, it took learning about Nanjing, the forgotten Holocaust
ofWorld War 11, to learn not to. Those who know me understand that
I have a deep respect for Japanese and Meijji culture and history.
Hang around me enough and you'll see me eating surreal sushi at
4:30 a.m. while I do my laundry or playing hall soccer with my friends
from Tokyo. My point? I don't hate the Japanese now, and there's
something ironic about the fact thatfor me, my appreciation of their
culture begins with a historical event where they slaughtered 300,000
of my people.
It started three years ago with Iris Chang's epic "Rape of Nanking,"
a horrifying and chilling account of Japanese war crimes against
the then-Chinese capital in 1937. Suddenly, I understood why I was
taught by my parents and my grandparents and my relatives and
those in my culture to hate a people that looked just like me. It was
one war, the act of individuals on the battlefield. As horrific as the
transgressions of the Japanese were, I was no better to hate an entire race of people for the actions of a brutal army more than half a
century ago. It was an epiphany of sorts
the type you're ashamed
of, the type where you realize those closest to you have taught you
wrong.

The movie "Nanjing 1937" re-evoked the feelings of hatred for me
and kindled a rage I'm not proud of. It reached for and touched an
archetype deep within the darkest realm of me and made me seethe.
It filled me with anger and hate like nothing has ever done before.
"Nanjing 1937" was the most amazing war movie
cinematographically and plot-wise
that I have ever seen. "Saving Private
Ryan" would look like a classless B-movie juxtaposed with this one.
Wu handles infinitely more challenging subjects (rape and senseless
murder) with aplomb and sensitivity. The movie is horrifically violent, full of killing, rape, mass graves and other horrific crimes committed by the Japanese, including a historically verified account of
a Japanese soldier giving a baby a stick of dynamite and a Samuraistyle killing competition between two soldiers that hits the triple
digits.

There's only one movie I can really think to compare "Nanjing
1937" to: "Schindler's List." In terms of its subject matter and quality of cinematography and plot development, Spielberg's classic is
the only thing that compares. The parallels runs deep, including a
star from the "flip side"—heroes in both "Schindler's List" (Schindler
himself) and "Nanjing 1937" (Haruko, the heroine) come from the
side of the transgressor.
Honestly, it's a genuine shame Wu Ziniu's film hasn't been exposed to a greater international audience. Had it been an American
release, we would be talking about Wu in the same breath as James
Cameron and Stephen Spielberg.
Wu was present last Thursday evening for the screening as part
of the Chinese Film Festival and International Symposium. If you
missed it, then you missed out big time. Kong put together quite an
amazing event overall, and to me, this was the highlight
or maybe
it was the lowlight.
During the question-and-answer session with Wu, which I have
record of only because I took notes with a shaking hand, he promised he'd leave a copy of "Nanjing 1937" with Professor Kong so he
could duplicate it and make it available to the students here. Pick a
night where you feel like challenging and learning something about
yourself and grab it. You might learn the best thing you can find out
about yourself— something you didn't know you had in vou.

'Kid A' may not like you, but it loves me
BY JAE WON CHUNG
Radiohead the band, that is
is like a hot new girlfriend. I've "met
with"her thrice before. In retrospect,
our first encounter was embarrassing. She came to me wholly, without
restraint, belting out adolescent anthems like "Creep." Yeah, so it was
cheesy. I know that. Everyone knows
that. But I fell for her hard anyway.
And later, just when I was thinking that it was a one-night stand, she
came back with "The Bends," a solid
rock album if there ever was one.
"Virtually flawless ..." some critic
said, and this made my excitement
feel justified.
Then with the next album, I
found out she was smart, too. Everyone who has heard "OK Computer"
knows what I'm talking about. Don't
you remember? It was in your CD
player for about a month straight.
Yeah, same here.
On Oct. 2, shereturned with "Kid
A" (EMI Records). I had been waiting for weeks. In the first track, "Everything in Its Right Place," the vocals are sampled and schizophrenically spliced, so it feels like the CD is
skipping (note the clash with the
title). It's exciting at first, but it gets
old pretty fast. Like I said, if you
know "OK Computer," you know that
expectations have been set. There
should not be a single dull moment.
So I want to tap her on the shoulder
and say, "Um
that feels nice, but
can we move onto something else?"
Eventually, we do. The title track
begins with a cyclical whineof a UFO
landing. In the distance, a train is arriving (you know that clanking warning bell). Cue a musicbox melody, followed by a drumming that is like a
heartbeat, light and insistent. Is there
singing? Yes. Who is singing? The logical answer, it seems, isKid A. But Kid
A doesn't sound too good. In fact, he
sounds like Krang (the cranky brain
from the Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles). But he sings in tune, and that
Krang is singing in tune is frightening. Did you get all that? UFO. Train.
Music box. Heartbeat. Krang in tune.
The next two tracksreturn us (me
and Radiohead, not you and me) to
normalcy, kind of. "The National Anthem" begins with a bassline I might
just call phat and a beat I might just
nod to. Then a hornsection enters like
no horn section has ever entered a nationalanthem. Either they all have to
be somewhere else, or the conductor
is being attacked by a swarm ofbees.
"How to Disappear Completely"
sounds Radiohead enough to be a
...

single (hello, guitar strumming).

Thorn Yorke begins like he often

Thorn Yorke of Radiohead
does, doped up on Sudafed. The chorus begins, mellow: "I'm not here.
This isn't happening ..." (hello,
muted despair) and gradually soars
to the trademark wailing thatmakes
Radiohead so beautiful.
The tracks "Optimistic," "In
Limbo" and "Morning Bell" are
easier to swallow, in that you can
imagine yourself butchering them
with power chords without sounding
egregiously mistaken.
"Idioteque" is my favorite track.
Over a hard, steady, club beat, it's
Yorke over Yorke over Yorke, chant-

ing, echoing, converging. Later, I
hear it on WSRN, and I think, "Hey,
it doesn't seem so out of place."
But Radiohead no longer seems to
care about writinghit singles. For her,
the question is not whether thealbum
has catchy songs. The album, as a

whole, is the irreducible unit; a song

by itselfis like a measure ofmusic in
isolation (Radiohead fans know how
much emphasis is placed on track sequencing). Motifs return throughout
the album inform ofbizarre, manipu-

lated sounds, so that when you hear
it again two or three tracks later, it
sounds eerily familiar.
But the problem with "Kid A" is
clear. We (this time, you and me) are
not
comfortable
with the
crazycircusfreak soundsthat drivethe
melodies. "OK Computer" was weird,
but it was grounded in edgy guitar
lines and somewhat recognizable lyrics. The overarching theme was explicit, and its Huxlean vision, more
identifiable. So what is "Kid A" about
exactly? There are no liner notes to
yield clues. Yorkerefuses to enunciate.
I feel like a shut-out boyfriend, wondering, "What's the matter? What are

Titles provide textual context,
and that's why "Motion Picture
Soundtrack" is the perfect last
track. When the chorus begins,
harp-lines fall like curtains over
the vocals. Yorke's last note is an
unresolved ascension—sentimental, yet somehow self-conscious.
The ticker on my CD player
continues in silence, hinting a hidden track. After a full minute, a
amalgam ofsymphonic sounds begins to swell. It is a 50-second crescendo, followed by two minutes
of unexplained silence (the album
ends there). But this sound, so
strangely arranged, was heard
eight tracks before, in the chorus
of "Kid A." What does this return
signify? Yorke has said that "Kid
A" is about the first clonedhuman
being. The voice ofKid A (Krang)
might be semantically void, but if
you imagine it to be the voice of a
cloned child, your heart tightens.
Can Kid A find a place in our
world? I think the central theme
of "Kid A" is being out of place.
"Motion Picture Soundtrack" is
music without the motion picture. Without the context of accompanying pictures, the silence
which flanks the final seconds of
sound in the album is meaningless (since we cannot see the action behind the silence), and
seems to us alien and hateful.
And you might think this
about "Kid A": out of place, alien,
hateful. So Radiohead
the
band
is like an exotic girlfriend. She's mysterious. Sometimes, it's hard to see what she's
getting at. But boy, is she hot.

Barron said he is not sure how
much is currently in the discretionary fund and put a rough estimate
at between $12,000 and $15,000. In
previous years, about $35,000 has

He said he was surprised to have
received only five proposals so far
for use of those funds, adding that
two SBC meetings this year were
canceled because of the lack of pro-

In spite of groups' complaints
about the tightened financial situation, Barron sees a silver lining in
the funding cut: it could help groups

should also help alleviate the effects
of the cut, Barron said.
But this is not a viable strategy

for every group. Allen said she cur-

rently must fundraise to cover her
salary, which is not paid by the college.

Future of budgeting
As for the future funding of student groups, there will be no additional budget cuts next year, and
spending could increase by 5 percent to 10 percent, Barron said. But
though the SAF will probably be
raised by about $3O next year, student groups will see little of that
additional money, since most of it
will go toward rebuilding the capital replacement fund. The goal is to
have the fund back up to $150,000 by
2003, according to Barron.

in second place at the Dickinson Invitational in
Carlisle, Pa.
Both Jeuland and Agunloye were later named
to the Centennial Conference Honor Roll for their

performances.
The chilly, brisk climate provided a change for
the Garnet, as this was the lowest temperature to
date for any type of running for the team. Despite
the unusual weather, the team fared quite well.
"This was an excellent tune-up for regionals,"
said head coach Pete Carroll. The Mid-East
Regional race wiil be held in the same location on
Nov. 11
The men's team finished 22nd out of 39
teams in its first 8K invitational. Despite being
45th at the first mile split, Jeuland finished in
second place with a personal best time of 25:59.
Sam Evans 'Ol finished next for Swat in 79th

THE SWEET
SPOT

Politics, sports similar
from drugs to unions
I have just as much of a sweet spot for American politics
do for sports. So you can imagine my excitement when I
Irealized
just

as

how many similarities there are between the race
for president and the things going on in the sports world.
Okay, I'm lying about the excitement. It's a sad day in the
world when sports become as much of a joke as George W.
Bush. But getting back to those similarities...
In case you don't already know, George W. Bush used a lot of
drugs in college. It seems like not a lot of people give a damn.
Similarly, many American athletes tested positive for drug use
at this year's Olympics. But while Dubya's coke habit wouldn't
exactly make him a better president, the steroids that these
athletes took certainly made them more competitive.
Though this corruption of the Olympics was bad enough,
the general public's indifferent reaction to the flurry of
positive drug tests was more appalling. Even the chairman of
the International Olympic Committee said these events were
the "best ever." I apologize for seeming a bit jaded, but I grew
up in an era when the only drug-abusing athletes were 450pound Russian weightlifters with back hair and Canadians

(Ben Johnson).
But the Olympics are over, so surely another sport or
athlete is currently in a state of self-mockery. Take Allen
Iverson, for example, whose veneration of guns and ridicule of
women and gays in his new rap album make him a poster boy
for the Pat Buchanan campaign. Even though Iverson claims
that nobody under 21 should buy the album, have a sneaking
suspicion that 10-year-old posers around the country will soon
be arguing whether or not Shaq's album is better than

I

Iverson's.
At the same time, MTV's "Celebrity Death Match" now has a
sports figure to pit against John Rocker who is not Fuzzy
Zoeller. Come to think of it, Zoeller vs. Rocker would be funny,
provided that Zoeller could use his golf clubs to level the
playing field.
That takes care of Bush and Buchanan, so how about
Gore? Well, Gore is concerned that Bush's tax cut is designed
to benefit the wealthiest one percent of Americans. Similarly,
Bob Costas fears that the lack of a salary cap in baseball
benefits the wealthiest teams. Considering that Gore
fabricated so many stories during the first presidential debate,
let's see if Costas' worries are justified.
The four teams remaining in the MLB playoffs are the
Yankees, the Mariners, the Mets and the Cardinals. Each team
has one of the highest 14 payrolls in the league, but there are
only 30 teams in the league. Furthermore, only three of the
teams with the highest 10 payrolls even made the playoffs. Of
course, all of these numbers would confuse George W. Bush,
and he might even accuse me of using fuzzy math, but the
fact is that a high payroll does not guarantee a thing. Look at
the Orioles, for example.
So who's left? Nader? He's a big supporter of unions, and so
am I, but look at what the players' union strikes did for
professional sports.

Field hockey downs Western Md.
BY MAUREEN VERNON
The Garnet field hockey team improved its record
to 8-4 overall and 4-2 in the Centennial Conference with
a win over Western Maryland on Oct. 5. The team has
a crucial Centennial Conference match-up today
against Washington.
Playing its second Centennial Conference game of
the week, the Garnet took the field last Thursday and
pounded Western Maryland, scoring 3 goals in the first
half. Forward Alison Gaffney 'O2 led the way with 2
goals, and her double tally earned her a place on the
weekly Centennial Conference honor roll. Midfielder
Ingrid Kaszas 'O3 scored the other goal.
The Garnet showed intensity and teamwork in the
first half, but the second halfwas not as focused. Coach
Karen Borbee said the team could not let its center
slip. "We need to stay focused through the last two
weeks of the season and not take any team lightly,"
she said.

Staying on task throughout the game will be the
true test for the Garnet. "After a weekend off from
hockey, we took the field on Tuesday ready to practice and prepare for our game against Washington,"
saidKatie Tarr 'O2. "The practice went well. The team's

psyched."
Washington College is currently second in the conference. With only one loss in the conference, it is a
team the Garnet would love to beat. Goalie Kate
Nelson-Lee 'O3 said the game is crucial in deciding
playoff status.
"Washington will be the make-or-break game for
us," she said. "If we win, barring natural disaster, we
will definitely be in the playoffs. If we don't, I don't
know if two wins over Haverford and Bryn Mawr will
be enough. If we want to control our own destiny,
rather than relying on the rest of the conference, we
need to win on Thursday."
The Garnet is also looking to avenge the past few
Washington games, when the team failed to play to its
full potential. However, if the Garnet manages to put
its all out on the field on Thursday, it should be in an
excellent position to win. "If we come ready to play,
we are a tough team to beat," said Borbee.
The team also plays home on Saturday against
Neumann College, and the annual alumni field hockey
game will follow. The field hockey team has an active
group of hockey alums, making the event fun for everyone. Assistant coach Kelly Wilcox '97 will play in

the match.

was spent selling the world's largest supercomputer,
ASCI White, and the other half of which was spent
planted squarely in the employee's lounge at Compaq.
What do I mean by congruent balls? Maybe I was
spoiled by this summer, but it's nice to have more than
two cues with tips and a crate full of balls that look like
they were bought one-by-one in separate trips to the
Salvation Army.
There's something aesthetically satisfying about
playing billiards with a set of balls that has a 9 and is
uniform in appearance. It's a simple request and
shouldn'tbe too expensive to fill, even with Student
Budget Committee molestation of any and all enjoyable
events on campus. SBC sheesh, talk about a job you
couldn't get me to take at gunpoint.
What I like about pool
and why I was opposed to
the pinball machines is that it's a game you play with
somebody else. Pinball is just another hour of being in
front of something, pushing buttons and watching
blinking lights, which I spend most of my day doing
anyhow. Something like pool orfoosball actually
promotes social interaction.

Minutes later, Pastor knocked in another goal.
With a 3-0 lead and only 20 minutes left in the game, Swat let the intensity level drop. "We got distracted,
stared into the sun," said co-captain
Ryan Neiheiser 'O2.

That lull gave Neumann the op-

portunity to score two goals in quick

succession and put Swarthmore on
its heels. "That was our wake-up call.
We played good, tough defense for the
rest of the game," said Kramer, who
stepped off the bench to replace injuredstarting goalkeeper Chris Milla
'O3.
Pastor was named Centennial
ConferencePlayer of the Week for his
two-goal effort. The tallies brought
his totals for the season to three goals
and one assist, good for seven points
and 11thplace in the conference scoring ranks.

Cameron MacDearmid tries to stay even with his Alvernia mark in the second
half on Wednesday afternoon. Swarthmore lost 1-0 to Alvernia in overtime.
Alvernia even for 90 minutes, the team
fell on a "golden goal."
The game against Lebanon Valley
scheduled for Oct. 9 was cancelled because of Yom Kippur.
The team is hoping to finish the sea-

son strong.
"There are definite moments
when we're playing a good game,"
Neiheiser said. "We just haven't done
it for a whole ninety minutes and
that's what we're going for."

Garnet Tide falls to
Muhlenberg 31-14
BY JUSTIN KANE
After opening up an early 7-0 advantage, the Garnet Tide fell to Muhlenberg's aerial attack 31-14 last
Saturday in Allentown, Pa.
Swarthmore's early lead evaporated when
Muhlenberg wide receiver Joshua Carter and quarterback Michael McCabe solved the Tide defense in
the second quarter and teamed up to lead the Mules
to three quick scores.
Muhlenberg limited running back Ken Clark 'O3 to
only 28 yards, but Swarthmore made up the difference
through the air. Quarterback Scott Murray 'Ol threw
for 172 yards and one touchdown, hooking up with receiver Keith McManimen 'O2 for a 71-yard strike.
The Garnet Tide has a bye this weekend. Next
weekend Swarthmore (2-3) travels to Dickinson (2-3),
which is coming off a 23-0 shutout against Franklin &
Marshall.

IT'S NICE TO HAVE MORE THAN A CRATE
FULL OF BALLS THAT LOOK LIKE THEY
WERE BOUGHT ONE-BY-ONE IN SEPARATE
TRIPS TO THE SALVATION ARMY.
Speaking of foosball, what'd they do with the table?
I'm pretty sour about its disappearance. I guess that
means that my dream for a SuperChexx match with the
Hanson brothers isn't going to be fulfilled any time soon.
Not the fruity pop band that lives down the street from
me back at home, but from Paul Newman's 1977 classic
comedy. For those of you who don't know, a SuperChexx
machine is kind of like a hockey version of foosball,
typically with Canadians or Russians playing Americans.
I prefer Canadians myself, as my generation has
clearly been trained by the great prophet Cartman to
hate our neighbors to the north, who have provided us
with nothing but crap like Brian Boitano, watered-down
beer and my lazy vegan RA.
Meanwhile, Russians have provided us with good
things in the last few years, like alcohol that gets the
point (i.e., getting you wasted quickly), an unnamed,
overrated tennis star whose face really isn't that good
and Adriana Sklenarikova.
Anyhow, back to the pool tables and the gameroom.
Props to Jordan Brackett and Student Council for
bringing those upstairs for us. People won't do anything
unless it's conveniently on their way to something they
have to do, like get their credit at Tarble. Or should I say,
get spanked by captive market economics by Dining
Disservices after break (see the news story on pg. 3).
Now that the tables are upstairs, all we need is the
proper equipment to enjoy the game of pool to its
fullest. Until we get them, we should clearly blame
Canada.*
