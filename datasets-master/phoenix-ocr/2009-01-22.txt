Gloria Evans leaves a legacy that crosses borders
BY ALEX ROLLE
arollel@swarthmore. edu

Gloria Evans, Swarthmore's International Student
Advisor, passed away on Dec. 25,2008. She was 8L Evans initially came to the college as an associate professor of psychology, serving as leave replacement for acclaimed psychologist Solomon Asch. Evans was asked to stay on after
Asch returned, and her role developed into advising international students on visa and immigration issues as well as
other aspects of living and studying in a foreign country.
In addition to her position as International Student
Advisor, Evans taught an English for Foreign Students
course and served on the Foreign Study Committee.
Evans earned a B.S. at Western Washington University,
a master's of science at the University of Washington and a
Ph.D. in psychology from Stanford.
While at Swarthmore, Evans met her husband, Philip
Evans '4B, a noted physician for whom Swarthmore's Philip
Evans Scholarship was named. GloriaEvans was a member
of the advising team to the Evans Scholars while they were

at Swarthmore.

Under Evans' stewardship, the college's ability to make
international students comfortable at Swarthmore
improved dramatically. Notably, Evans saw the creation of
a specific orientation event for international students.
Originally, Swarthmore's international students were welcomed with just a lunch held at some point during first-year
orientation, but by the 2008-2009 school year the college was
able to host a three-day international student orientation
preceding first-year orientation, which includes programs
on adjusting to life at an American college and a trip to

Philadelphia,

Gloria Evans, beloved advisor of international students.
"It was very helpful because most of us hadn't lived in
this country before, and international orientation was a
nice transition," said Eun Mi Lee 'l2, an international student originally from South Korea.
Michael Xu 11, one of the co-presidents of 120, the international student club on campus, emphasized how important Evans was to internationalorientation.
"We [the presidents of i2o] set up the schedule, but once
we gave it to her she communicated with everyone else. It
was really her that made things happen," he said.
Beyond adjusting to the culture of the United States,
international orientation also served very practical purpos-

es. "Most international students aren't brought to college by
their parents, so they come without sheets and things like
that," Clarissa Skinner 'l2 said. During this period, international students are taken to Target and other local stores,
and given advice about what they would need for a college
dorm room.
Over the course of international orientation, Evans met
every student, along with any relatives who brought them
to Swarthmore. This introduction often proved invaluable
for the students, who found Evans an important resource
long after classes began.
"She helped me in the beginning of semester because I
lost my 1-20 form [A Department of Homeland Security form
that universities use to provide information in support of a
student visa]. I thought I would be in trouble, but she was
very nice about it," Lee said. In addition, Evans helped Lee
and other international students find jobs on campus in
order to get a Social Security number, necessary for many
aspects of life in the United States, from getting a cell phone
to opening a bank account.
"She would come to our [i2o] meetings maybe once a
month and hang out with students and ask how their lives
were going," Xu said. "I have friends who would go to her
for advice and help a 10t... she was a great adviser and mentor."
Evans was an avid antiquer, and according to her profile
on the Swarthmore web site, much of Evans' time was taken
up with a small antiques business she owned, along with
traveling to many of the countries that the students she
advised called home.
A memorial service for Evans will be held at the.
Swarthmore Friends Meeting House at 4 p.m. on Friday,
Jan. 30.

File sharing

RIAA shifts prosecution away from individual user
BY DANTE FUOCO

dfuocol@swarthmore.edu

The Recording Industry Association
ofAmerica announced last month that it
would stop prosecuting individuals for
pirating copyrighted music, hoping that
working with commercial Internet
ice providers will prove to be a more
effective way of preventing illegal filesharing.
Under their new policy, if the RIAA
suspects that someone is illegally downloading or sharing music, the trade
group will contact that individual's
Internet Service Provider. According to
The Chronicle of Higher Education,
ISPs will then execute what the RIAA is
calling

a "graduated-response program"

the ISP will first issue warnings to
suspected offenders via e-mail, and if
after multiple warnings, these users fail
to stop file-sharing their accounts could
be suspended.
The Wall Street Journal reported in
December that the RIAA claims to have
reached deals with major ISPs but is not
willing to say which ones.According to The Chronicle of
Higher Education, the new program is
supposed to deal with commercial ISPs,
not colleges, because many schools
already have similar response systems
in place. The RIAA will still send
notices of copyright infringement to colleges, but since they have stopped
actively pursuing lawsuits', the group
will not send any new pre-litigation let-

ters.

The RIAA still reserves the right to
prosecute the most egregious file-sharers, a threshold defined by the PC
Journal as downloading 5,000 to 6,000
songs a month.

THE PHOENIX

Since 2003, the RIAA has filed lawsuits against about 35,000 individuals
for as much as $150,000 per pirated song.
The trade group plans on continuing all
outstanding lawsuits.
But while some find the RIAA's move
a
radical
in
change
policy,
Swarthmore's
Chief
Information
Technology Officer Gayle Barton said
that she doesn't foresee it having a significant effect on the college.
"By law, we have to make our best
effort to prevent file-sharing," Barton
said. "Our policy was driven by the law.
Them changing their business practices
doesn't change our policy."
And considering how recently the
RIAA made this announcement, Barton
said, it's still "unclear" what will happen.
"They're not going to stop trying to
enforce copyright law or trying to make
sure that they can protect their income
stream," she said. "What are they going
to do instead? Because it's not like they
don't care."
Orion Sauter 'll, a public area consultant for ITS, said that though the
RIAA's decision "might seem like a nice
ideological idea," he's "not sure it
makes a difference" because the school
is still expected to prevent illegal filesharing. In fact, the bar has been raised
for college's enforcement of copyright
laws, said Sauter and Barton.
Higher
Fall,
This past
the
Educational Opportunity Act was
passed, forcing schools with any federal
funding to "effectively combat" illegal
file-sharing across campus and "to
detect and punish" any known instances
of it. Barton met with the deans in the
fall to work on modifying the school's
policy accordingly and to draft a cam-

pus-wide e-mail addressing the subject.
"The changes to policy [were] really
only to be sure that our response to take

down notices was not only fair to students, but also strong enough to convey
how serious a matter this is becoming
the risks such actions by students place
on themselves and on the college,"
Associate Dean for Academic Affairs
Garikai Campbell said in an e-mail.
While the RIAA has not brought any
lawsuits against Swarthmore students
in recent years, Barton said that there
have been 31 notices from trade groups
informing the school of piracy, 16 of
which were from the RIAA. In these
instances, the school must identify the
computer referred to in the notice, write
to the owner of that computer and block
him or her from the network until illegal activity stops.
The RIAA's decision, however, shows
that the recording industry has realized
their current policies do not appeal to
the consumers' hunger for instant
access to entertainment, Barton said.
"I think this whole market is evolving, and the entertainment industry will
discover how to make money," she said.
"We're getting to have more choices. I
think the entertainment industry is
learning new ways [to appeal to consumers]."

Two weeks ago, for example; Apple
announced a major revision in the copy
protection policies for music purchased
from its popular iTunes Store. Namely,
major music labels are allowing Apple
to sell music free of digital rights management, a lock used by iTunes in the
past to prevent music from being shared
outside the bounds of what the RIAA
considers "fair use."
Moreover, Apple has announced that

January 22, 2009

it is changing its pricing structure for
music on iTunes, affording labels
greater flexibility in determining how
much customers will pay for song downloads. This change could make users
more drawn to legal downloading over
illegal downloading, said Barton.
There have been other, equally significant changes taking place in how
music is sold over the Internet. For
example, with the release of the album
"In Rainbows," Radiohead paved the
way for "pay-as-you-like" albums, giving
fans the power to choose the price of
downloads and, in Radiohead's case,
giving the artist a sustainable profit.
But there may be even more drastic
changes in the works. On Monday, the
BBC reported that the music industry
might force ISPs to pay for music and
then provide that music to subscribers.
Barton said in an e-mail that she thinks
this is the "real next step for the music
industry."
"They don't want to go after people
one at a time," she said. "They want a

whole new distribution channel to be
up and, at the expense of the ISP,
passed along to the customers/These
changes could, have consequences,
though. Apple's change is intended to
allow individuals greater freedom to
move their music between different
devices, not between different people,
said Barton.
If the music industry chooses to force
ISPs to pay for music, it "would be an
expensive and time consuming service
to set up and maintain, and it would
have a serious impact on our ability to
provide College-related technology support and services," Barton said.
"I think it'll be interesting to see how
it plays out," Barton said.

Swarthmore Campaign

Students pressure college to divest from Israel
through terror, brutal oppression, expulsion and mass
killings," Ricciardone said.

HANNAH PURKEY
hpurkeyl@swarthmore.edu
A group of alumni started an effort to gather signatures this week asking Swarthmore to divest from Israel

because of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the Gaza
strip, West Bank and Israel. Those who signed the online
open letter promised to withhold any future donations to
the school until Swarthmore ceases to do business with
any companies in Israel, those that do business with
Israel, and "other holdings that financially support or
sustain Israeli state sponsored apartheid," according to
the campaign's Web site.
"We were grieving and feeling so helplessly angry
about the deaths in Gaza," campaign organizer Chiara
Ricciardone 'O5 said. Her inspiration to begin the campaign at Swarthmore came from a newspaper article in
:

The Guardian encouraging widespread boycott, divestment and sanctions on Israel as well as from the positive
impact seen in the divestment in South Africa during

apartheid.

"We don't have much influence at the national level,
but we do have some leverage as Swarthmore alumni,"
Ricciardone said.
Since the Web site's launch on Friday, it has already
reached 100 signatures, exceeding its goal of 100 signa-

tures per week. The amount of support that current students and alumni are showing for the effort has surprised organizers. "I think the massacre in Gaza really

Swar.thmore students

watched as Barack Hussein Obama became the
44th President of the United States. The inauguration was shown at the Lang Performing Arts
Center, Sharpies Dining Hall, McCabe Library and
the Beardsley Hall Media Center. Countless other
TVs and computers across campus broadcasted the
swearing in ceremony to students in dorm lounges,
rooms and other public spaces.
"Watching the inauguration in Sharpies was
fantastic," said Michelle Walters 'l2. "It was completely* full and all the students gave it a very exciting atmosphere." Students packed into the communal areas cheered as President Obama was officially sworn in by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, as
the newly elected President delivered his inaugural address, and, less kindly, as former President
George W. Bush was seen exiting the ceremony.
"Possibly the loudest cheer of the day was for the
shot of Bush after Obama had finished his speech"
said Walters.
Many students began to leave Sharpies and
other public locations soon after President
Obama's inaugural address, missing the poem
Elizabeth Alexander composed for the event and
Dr. Joseph Lowery's benediction. Many of those
who stayed were suprised by Lowery's benediction, which included the passage: "We ask you to
help us work for that day when black will not be
asked to get in back, when brown can stick around,
when yellow will be'mellow, when the red man can
get ahead, man, and when white will embrace what
is right."
The inauguration was an important event for
the rest of the Swarthmore community as well.
Math professor Deb Bergstrand watched the ceremony at home with her family, and said in an
email that, "We were moved to tears and are filled

UNICEF program that provide boxes full of everything needed to run a school, including chalk, slates, and other materials. Afterwards, the two will work with the home to build
something more permanent. The curriculum is being carefully planned with the directors of the orphanage to include
lessons in leadership in addition to the usual subjects.
"Because some of these children are AIDS orphans, they're
a generation of people who haven't known sound leadership
or had a family setup," said Mahomva.
The pair plans to work closely over the next two years.

Affected by her own
experience as the daughter
of a single mother in Nepal,
Shrestha 'll plans to create
a psychological first aid
program for girls in Nepal
with the goal of helping
them regain the self-confidence they need for success. In an email she said,
"The ten day long program
will create reflective
processes for teenage girls
that give them new vantage
points from which to view

eir lives and gain power from within." She also described
the injustice that widows and their daughtersmust face on a
daily basis. "Widows are denied to wear anything red since
red is the color that defines a married woman in the Nepali
society. More than simply denying a widow of wearing auspicious colors, this denies them of their freedom and rights
to social life." Previously, Shrestha worked with the NGO
Women for Human Rights to document these injustices and
put together a movie. The organization will continue to help
her by making her new project sustainable once she has held
one program. She will also make a video to allow others to
replicate her program in other areas that face similar strug-

gles.
Although these women anticipate facing many obstacles
as they work to execute their visions, they are also flexible
and hopeful. To describe the feeling she has while standing
before such a daunting task, Erseker said, "We have a saying in Turkey. We say, "This is Turkey," which means that
anything can happen."

NEWS IN BRIEF

Martin Luther King, Jr. Day celebrated at college
In honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
Swarthmore held a breakfast, a luncheon and a viewing of the PBS documentary "In Remembrance of
Martin" on the federal holiday, all of which were open
to the entire college community.
Allison Dorsey, an associate professor of history
and coordinator of theBlack Studies Program, kicked
off the day's celebrations with a lecture at the break-,
fast whileBen Berger, an assistant professor of political science, was the keynote speaker for the luncheon.
Both speakers acknowledged that celebrating the
life and legacy of Dr. King this year is incomplete
without due mention of President Barack Obama.
Comparing America to Rip Van Winkle of
Washington Irving's eponymous short story, Dorsey
and awoke this
said, "America slept for eight years
past fall."
Drawing on the themes of unity and solidarity
found in Obama's popular slogan, "Yes, We Can," she
said, "As Dr. King reminds us, remain awake for the
revolution, our revolution." The breakfast ended with
Louis Armstrong's "What A Wonderful World."
In his lecture titled, "How Long? Not Long: Dr.
King's Legacy and Barack Obama's Presidency,"
Berger drew a similar parallel.
Reminding students that they do not live in a postracial society, as some would have them believe, and
that Obama's presidency is not the grand finale of Dr.
King's dream, Berger stressed that "there is much
...

work to be done, and not just by Obama." He made
this frighteningly clear when he played a clip of
"Barack, the Magic Negro," a parody based on "Puff,
the Magic Dragon."
Focusing on the differences between Obama and
King, Berger made the case that Obama is a politician
and community organizer, which allows him to partake in both moral and social engagement, while King
was a moral activist.
The differences in the kind of engagement they
represent place them in different spheres to carry out
their work.
Still, while the comparisons between King and
Obama are nothing new, it would be far from the
truth to say the claims have no substantial grounds.
It is certain that Obama sees the significance of Dr.
King in his own success and pays tribute to him for it
by drawing inspiration from a speech by King. In his
victory speech, Obama said, "Their hands [are] on the
arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope
of a better day."
King's words were "How long? Not long, because
the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends
toward justice."
"In Remembrance of Martin" included memories
of Dr. King from his wife, Coretta Scott King and
Bishop Desmond Tutu among others.

Green power

Borough among top in green power efficiency
Partners "must meet or exceed a minimum percentage of

BY ASH IA TROIANO
atroianl@swarthmore.edu

...

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, the borough of Swarthmore is ranked 12 among
all Green Power Communities in the U.S. In the borough,
14 percent of the energy use is green power. Swarthmore
was the only community east of the Mississippi River to
make the top 19 list.
Swarthmore has a history of being environmentally
conscious. "For about ten years, Swarthmore has been
leading in wind power, due to

the number of residents who

sign up for wind power by getting a wind certificate. It really
stepped up as the greenest community in Pa.," Carr Everbach,
Professor of Engineering and
Sustainability Committee CoChair, said. "It is important for
municipalities to act as leaders."
Most of the clean energy in
Swarthmore is supplied as wind

ments."
The College is also recognized in the EPA's leadership
club, meaning that Swarthmore, among several other
organizations, exceeds the EPA's minimum standards of
green power.
"The College's main contribution is its 6,000,000+ kWh
wind power credit purchase of 40 percent of electrical
use combined with the fact that the college is a fairly
heavy user of electricity. The

EPA

includes

College in the Green Power
Leadership Club based on that
percentage," Ralph Thayer,
Director of Maintenance, said
in an e-mail.
While the College has its
fair share of green facilities,
Everbach noted
that
the
Swarthmore put a significant
amount of pressure on the
College to do more in supporting green initiatives.
"The college supports greening by, for instance, providing
letters of support for grants
from the borough. But we

power, but also comes in other
forms such as solar power.
In 2007, the borough signed an
agreement with SmartPower, a
non-profit organization dedicated to using clean energy efficiently, to increase its clean energy consumption by 7

percent.
Geoff Semenuk,
former councilmember of
Swarthmore and current Associate Director of Alumni
Relations, said that while most communities were going
from 0 percent clean energy to 7 percent, Swarthmore
was already using more than 7 percent and then
increased their usage to a total of almost 20 percent after
signing the SmartPower agreement.
"To use 7 percent more clean energy, we needed about
200 more households [to do so]," Semenuk said. "And we
got ridiculously high participation from [the borough of]
Swarthmore." Though PECO, Swarthmore's energy supplier, would be billing Swarthmore residents a small
additionalfee to buy clean energy, residents were willing

said.
There are several ways to get involved in environmental sustainability on campus through student organizations. One of these includes Earthlust, a group dedicated to increasing environmental awareness on campus

through educational events.
The organization was also part of the initiative to convert 41 percent of the College's energy into clean energy.
Another such group is the GoodFood Project, an effort to
increase the use of organic food. Students can also take
advantage of the environmental studies department,
which includes classes and professors from the humanities and social and natural sciences.

While it is not directly related to the town's ranking
or the college's status as a Green Partner, Swarthmore's
Sustainability Committee promotes environmental initiatives to the administration. All of these methods have
impacted Swarthmore's environmentalist reputation.
And while the financial crisis is still in full swing,
Semenuk doubts that the College's environmental initiatives will suffer. "Energy products tend to pay for themselves. In the grand scheme of things, it's better to pay
for it," he said.
"The college does the best it can, but [energy consumption] is a societal problem," Semenuk said. "For
example, 20 years ago, the college didn't turn off the heat
because it was too much of a hassle. Now they do. But if
we lowered the thermostats by just four degrees, it would
be a little uncomfortable and people would complain, but
doing the right thing is sometimes a bit of an imposi-

tion."
To become a Green Power Community, the community must sign a partnership contract with the EPA, meet
the standards of the EPA green power consumption within one year of signing the contract and use their
resources to help local organizations become more environmentally friendly as well.
The top three Green Power Communities listed on the
EPA website are Bellingham, Washington, Santa Clara,
California and Beaverton, Oregon.

Power use by top green power communities nation-wide

to bear the additional cost.

Semenuk noted that Professor of History Marjorie
Murphy's class spent much of her time canvassing and
tabling in Swarthmore to get more people to sign on for
green energy. Most of this canvassing was done by offering the residents a chance to buy wind certificates to supply their homes with wind power.
"It's been great seeing the community respond and
the college students participating as much as they did,"
Semenuk said.
Currently, the town is applying for the Pennsylvania
Energy Harvest Grant, a program that funds projects
that improve air and water quality. If Swarthmore is
awarded the grant, the funds will be used to buy an energy collector. Originally, plans were made to buy a IK collector. Stressing the fact that every little bit helps,
Semenuk said, "A IK collector provides a minimal
amount ofelectricity; it's minimalbut at least that much
we wouldn't be buying from a power company." But if
Swarthmore receives the grant, it will buy a 5K collector.
The collector, a large box that provides energy to an
entire building, would be placed on top of Borough Hall
in the Ville. "It will be very visible. This way, kids would
ask their parents about it, and then the parents would
have to find out what it is," Semenuk said.
The funds will also go towards a screen inside of
Borough Hall that displays how much electricity is being
used and created by the energy collector, which is also
meant to attract the attention of children. In addition,
there will be a web-cam on the roof linked to the Internet,
which will then display that same information to people
at home.
Utilizing a significant portion of its energy, which is
calculated into the energy consumption of the entire
town, Swarthmore College contributes to the town's
environmental responsibility, so much that it is an EPA
Green Power Partner.
According to the EPA's Website, "The Green Power
Partnership is a voluntary program that supports the
organizational procurement of green power by offering
expert advice, technical support, tools and resources."

Cancer research

Oregon State U. professor aims to cure cancer
cancer-killing capabilities and presented their findings
in the medical science journal Cancer Cell last fall.

BY EMILY SMITH
OREGON DAILY EMERALD (OSU)
(U-WIRE) The cure to cancer may lie close to home
and it might come in the form of a biological assassin.
--

Siva Kolluri, assistant professor of cancer biology in
the environmental and molecular toxicology department
at Oregon State University, discovered a cancer-killing
molecule nearly nine years ago and published an article
last fall that revealed his team's findings on how to enact
thekiller.

Although it was years in the making, Kolluri and his
team's discovery was a surprise even to them, when
Kolluri first realized that the dangerous force of a cancer-protecting protein could not only be neutralized, but
also turned cancer-killing.
"We said, 'We have something new here. We cannot
ignore this, this is working,'" he said. "Thousands of scientists across the world have studied this protein for
years."

After publishing the initial findings in some of the
nation's top science journals, Kolluri's team pursued the
research further. At the top of Kolluri's agenda for the
past several years has been finding a way to force the
cancer cell's protector, the protein Bcl-2, into acting as a
cancer killer.
Now, he and a team of researchers from OSU and
Burnham Institute for Medical Research in La Jolla,
Calif, have developed a peptide that invokes the Bcl-2

While scientists knew that Bcl-2 could either protect
or destroy cancer cells, they didn't previously know how
to induce the protein's destructive capability. Kolluri
identified a molecule that would do the job.
What Kolluri and his colleagues noticed "accidentally" in lab research those years ago became the foundation for a groundbreaking study, which led them to develop a peptide that could revolutionize how certain cancers
are treated.
Kolluri and other researchers found that nuclear
receptor Nur77 can interact with and convert Bcl-2 cells,
which protect cancer cells and allow tumors to resist
treatment and continue growing, into cancer cell killers.
Hui Zong, a University of Oregon assistant professor
of biology and cancer biology researcher, said the discovery is innovative.
"Bcl-2 is a molecule that protects the (cancer) cell
from dying," Zong said. "If they can turn Bcl-2 into a prodeath cell, that will be interesting to help cure cancer."
The same protein that protects cancer cells appears in
many types of cancer, Kolluri said in a statement, and is
responsible for cancer cells' resistance to many
chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation.
For that reason, cancer-fighting drugs that target Bcl-2 are an appealing possibility.
In an OSU news release, Linda Wolff, a leukemia
researcher at the National Institutes of Health's Center

for Cancer Research in Bethesda, McL, said the
researchers' discovery is rare in the world of cancer
research.
"Although the peptide they studied causes cancer cells
to die, its effect on normal cells seems to be quite minimal," she said. "A big problem in cancer research has
been getting therapies that don't kill normal cells."
Zong said the new research could lead to muchimproved cancer treatments, since it would, attack the
cancer in an unprecedented way.
"It's a novel idea, nobody's done this before," he said.
"Most treatments are actively dividing cells, and that's
how they are killed."
Dividing cells causes the common negative side
effects of chemotherapy treatment, such as hair loss and
damage to the intestinal lining. The prospect of targeting

Bcl-2 cells could treat cancer in a new way sans cell division and the common side effects.
Bcl-2 is expressed in the cancer cells of many types of
cancer. However, Kolluri said, the peptide has not killed
cancer cells where the protein is not present.
"We've tried it on mice and found that if you do not
have Bcl-2, the cancer does not respond at all," he said.
While Kolluri and his colleagues have high hopes that
the discovery will lead to effective therapeutic cancer
treatments, they still face the challenge of isolating the
Bcl-2 cells for conversion in clinical studies.
"This was years of work, commitment and belief,"
Kolluri said. "It was a collaborative effort."

Facebook

Employers discuss Facebook posts consequences
BY LAURA MIRVISS
THE NEW HAMPSHIRE (UNH)
(U-WIRE) There is always controversy surrounding addictions. Drugs and
alcohol gradually decay our bodies, gambling puts us in the hole, and some addic~

tions are downright unmentionable.
However, Facebook, the compulsivelychecked social networking tool has left us
scratching our heads as to whether or not
the addiction is a healthy one.
There were 132.1 million Facebook
users as of June 2008 compared to
MySpace, which attracted 117.6 million
users, according to ComScore, a global
Internet provider that measures consumer response to the digital world. The
average Facebook user spends 19 minutes
on the site a day, and as of 2007, Facebook
received 40 billon hits a month.
As Facebook becomes increasingly
mainstream, does the content of the profile reflect the shift? Is it appropriate for
college-aged students to share silly pictures that could later be taken out of context and cost an individual their dream
job .or graduate school admission? Is
Facebook hurting or helping college students as they enter the already competitive job market?
Common sense is the best strategy
when it comes to Facebook, according to
Becky Shost, the employer relations coordinator for the University of New
Hampshire's advising center.
"You don't want to post anything that
would make you look like a bad candidate," said Shost. "Employers are looking
for reasons why they shouldn't hire you."
Shost went on to explain Facebook is
now a real consideration when it comes to
college-aged students entering the job
market. Though there are privacy settings that limit access to the profile picture, having unflattering images on the
Internet still poses a potential threat.
With theories of companies hiring

THE PHOENIX

hackers or creating decoy accounts to

find evidence of unflattering behavior,
the appeal in the social networking site
can be quickly deflated.

Privacy settings give off the impression an individual has the ability to share
specific information with specific people,
but Facebook's privacy setting states they
"share information with third parties
only in limited circumstances." This is
done only when the information sharing
is reasonably necessary to offer the service, legally required, and permitted by the
particular user, according to the website.
The networking site's privacy page
also explains that though they do all they
can in their power to protect user information, there's no guarantee.
"We cannot and do not guarantee that
user content you post on the site will not
be viewed by unauthorized persons," the
Facebook privacy page states. "We are not
responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the site."
Maura Quinn, Liberty Mutual's university relations program manager, said
when it comes to hiring interns or recent
graduates for entry-level positions,
Facebook isn't a factor.
"Facebook, as it-stands, is a social networking place for people to play," said
Quinn.
Quinn said UNH leads the way for the
company's internship positions with 15
students last summer and more than 30
full-time graduates working in entry-level
positions. Facebook didn't play a role in
the hiring process but rather academic
records and experience.
Both UNH's undergraduate and graduate admissions representatives said
Facebook doesn't play any role in the
admissions process, and like Liberty
Mutual, academic records and life experi-

ence are what determines acceptances.

"We don't look at Facebook for graduate school because it's personal," said

Laurie Witham from UNH's graduate
admissions. "It's a touchy subject."
Witham also said other programs
could potentially be looking into an applicant's Facebook profile.
However, of the top UNH employers,
there wasn't a single recruiter who would
go on the record as to whether or not they
use Facebook in the hiring process.
Instead, there remains a whisper that one
unfavorable picture or wall post on
Facebook could pose as a potential downfall, ruining everything a student works
toward in their college studies.
Not knowing the etiquette regarding
whether or not it's appropriate to consider a candidate's social life when competing for a job remains a challenge for
recruiters.
Another top company for recent UNH
alumni is Enterprise and, according to
regional recruiting manager Kimberly
Smith, Facebook once again isn't part of
the hiring process.
"Right now we see Facebook as personal, but I'm not sure if that'll be the case in

the future," said Smith.
Smith said Facebook could be used as a

and said it's a great networking tool, he
did recall an incident where an RA was
fired because a hall director found an
alcohol-related picture in the newsfeed.
Out of respect, Banks preferred to keep
the RA's name anonymous.
Similar to the situation of the fired RA,
Joanne Stella, UNH's student attorney,
said the only involvement with Facebook
she's encountered has to do with landlords discovering illegal behavior from
tenants that threatened lease agreements.
"I advise people to be careful about

what they put on there," said Stella.
Facebook was launched only four
years ago in 2004 as a way for Harvard
students to network. Within four months
of the launch, Facebook popularity grew
so exponentially that 30 colleges were
added to the network.
Because the tone of Facebook was initially aimed at the college culture, students have had to adapt and censor the
types of images they portray. As of fall
2006, anyone with a valid e-mail address
was allowed to join, significantly changing the culture of Facebook.
Though there has been a shift in the

way students portray themselves with

recruiting tool for the company. They
must simply set up pages for potential
employees to ask questions.
UNH's Student Body President John
Banks expressed concerns similar to
Shost from UNH's advising center, recommending common sense as the best indicator when it comes to Facebook posts.
"I know that employers and others will
check Facebook, MySpace, Google and
any other Internet networking site to
check on a perspective applicant," said
Banks. "And why wouldn't they? I would
imagine that pictures of people doing illegal things can have immense effect on
someone's chances of employment."
Banks went on to explain he makes an
effort to keep his profile clean, because
the information could potentially be mis-

pictures of public urination and inebriated vomiting, Jill Avallone, a senior at
UNH, stood by the social networking tool
saying it was beneficial in her study
abroad experience because she was able
to contact roommates beforehand.
This allowed Avallone to hit the
ground running when she arrived in Italy.
Though Facebook still plays an important
role with keeping in touch with friends
that Avallone met abroad, the social networking tool remains bittersweet.
"I think it is important to be conscious
of what pictures you have on your
Facebook page," said Avallone. "In a time
when reputation is so important, why do
people risk having pictures of themselves
drooling over a toilet bowl? It's unattrac-

construed. Though Banks likes Facebook

Rankings acclaim Swarthmore's value
The Princeton Review ranks the college as the premier value in higher education
publications that target prospective students.

BY JEFF DAVIDSON
jdavidsl@swarthmore.edu

However the college tries to distance itself from
them, the rankings will inevitably influence the
school, from bringing the attention-shy institution
into the glare of the public eye, to boosting admissions applications numbers. Furthermore, the consistency of being a highly ranked good value begs the
question, "What makes Swarthmore such a great
bang for your buck?" This question is particularly
significant in light of last semester's discontent surrounding financial aid and
Bloom's recent letter informing
the community of the $4OO million loss to the College endowlot

Despite a professed aversion to college rankings,
Swarthmore College has always been a beneficiary
of what one might call the "inner beauty" contest of
higher education. On Jan. 7, the college took a bold

total cost of the college (tuition, board and fees,
minus the average financial aid package). The
Tuition GPA does not take into account, however,
work-study or student loans.
Though the Princeton Review does not reveal how
much each category is weighed against the others,
they do call their system "stir[ring the data] up in an
algorithm based on the idea that bang for your buck
means excellent academics, great financial aid
and/or low tuition. Simply put, it means value."
Kiplinger uses many of the same determining factors, but is more exact with what it considered
important to value. According to Kiplinger.com, twothirds of a ranking is found by the school's academic
quality and one-third by affordability. These two categories are determined through data reported by
Peterson's as well as by Kiplinger itself.
Beyond numbers
Ostensibly "objective" attempts to pin down the
true value of a college are often criticized for missing

those qualities of an education that evade quantification. The companies who deal in college rankings
acknowledge this flaw and try to rectify it by surveying students, professors, and other members of
communities.

on a decline this year. According to the Princeton
Review, their data for determining the rankings
accounts for the fall of 2007 through the fall of 2008.
The effects of the economic decline on the college
were not officially brought to the students' attention
until a e-mail from Bloom to the campus community
on December 8.
Both Princeton Review and Kiplinger relied heavily on the cost of a college education to generate its
rankings. The college's financial aid policy is to provide 100 percent of a student's demonstratedfinancial
need. Student protests in the fall semester over the
definition of "demonstrated financial need"
"demonstrated" referring to a value calculated by the
financial aid office's private algorithm rather than
the amount of financial aid families claim to need
created a climate of skepticism towards the financial
aid office's lack of transparency in this process. The
college, however, has maintained that the financial
aid office awards as much money as it can to as many
as possible while making sound and sustainable economic decisions.

"Nobody knows where the economy is going to go I think we're all
in the same boat on this one."
Maurice Eldridge '6l
Vice President for College and
Community Relations
...

While the future of the finances of the college, and
indeed the nation, remains somewhat uncertain, the
annual college budget may be a very different picture
this year. There will be stricter rules for budgets
within departments that, according to Bloom's email, "ensure tighter management of our resources."
"Nobody knows where the economy is going to go
and where it's going to go once it gets there," Vice
President for College and Community Relations
Maurice Eldridge '6l said. "I think we're all in the
same boat on this one. Relative to other schools, our
positions aren't going to change very much."
Yet the major point is that these may only be problems limited to right now. They all hinge upon an economic rebound, which is something no economist can
truly ever predict.
"We have to protect the college for what it is and
what it stands for," Eldridge said. "Part of what we
have to do ,is be as persistent in our fundraising as
ever we were. Because the quality of this place is
dependent on philanthropy no matter what it is.
When the economy has gone south some, it's even
more important that we succeed there."
Bayer sees this as an opportunity for students to
take advantage of.
"In this difficult economic time, companies are
looking for the best and the brightest individuals.
There is a flight to quality that these companies are
taking, and Swarthmore graduates stand out since
they aren't simply technicians," Bayer said. "Rather,
Swarthmore alumni are multi-talented, flexible, able
to think creatively and act nimbly in the work place.
I think these are qualities that employers and organizations, and our society need to be successful."
He sees this especially helpful in terms offacilitating placement of current students into jobs with
alumni.
"I think Swarthmore alumni, because of the difficult economic times, are willing to look back to their
roots and understand the difficulty students are
undergoing now to get jobs," Bayer said.
Wherever the economy takes the college, the value
will do its best to follow.

It's not too often that a movie receiving Oscar buzz is filmed in two weeks

be one of those anomalies. And it might
turn out to be one of the Oscar lineup's

(likely the only reason this film is getting some mainstream coverage), Wendy
is a twenty-something, dirt-broke after a

has decided to shoot the moon and travel to Alaska to work in a fish cannery
along with her only companion, Lucy, a

Movie Review

"Button" uses technical skill in the service of art
BY ISAAC HAN
ihanl@swarthmore.edu

In the midst of the current award-season buzz, "The
Curious Case of Benjamin Button" has turned more than
just a couple of heads. Based on the F. Scott Fitzgerald's
short story of the same name, the film tells the story of a
man who is born old and ages backward to infancy. While
"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" ultimately lives
up to its Oscar buzz, more than just an interesting story
and good performances position this film with the Oscarworthy; its merits as a project largely lie within its innovative technical execution.
Among the most fascinating uses of technology in this
film are the photo and visual techniques that allow Brad
Pitt to cheat time: Pitt is present at all stages in the movie
due to a masterful and advanced use of photoshopping.
Pitt's altered head is placed on the bodies of other actors,
allowing him to play his character at all stages of life, from

backward while everyone else ages normally. It demonstrates how a fountain of youth makes life different, while
also showing that death is inevitable no matter how you
age or how you live. It also shows us that old age and infancy are not as different as everyone makes them out to be;

Aside from its recognition by the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences for its innovative and masterful
use of film technology, Fincher's film allows us to experience the life and curiosity of Benjamin Button and to look
at our own lives and how we try to cheat age in the real

old age to infancy. Expertly executed, this technology

allows the film to visually represent a man who defies the
constraints of time, allowing the Brad Pitt of the present to
become past, present and future versions of his character.
The photo technology exploited in "The Curious Case of
Benjamin Button" has its roots in past films like the 1995
Oscar winner "Forrest Gump," a film that similarly uses
photoshopping to map out an otherwise inexpressible narrative. "Forrest Gump" is well known for scenes in which
Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is edited into actual historical
videos, making it look like he was a real person who was

Lenape Course

New linguistics course encourages awareness
BY ALEX ISRAEL
aisraell@swarthmore.edu
In the minds of many, the history of the Philadelphia area
is intertwined primarily with Protestant colonialism. The
name of William Penn rises easily to the lips of most
Pennsylvania residents, who take pride in the region's history as a haven of religious freedom for Quakers and other
persecuted groups. This picture, however, represents a case
of historical amnesia that overlooks the history of the original inhabitants of the Delaware Valley: the Lenape Nation,
also known as the Delaware.

Phoebe Hansen The Phoenix

Shelley DePaul teaches the new Introduction to the
Lenape Language course, which is offered through the
Linguistics Department

The Swarthmore linguistics department is hoping to
change that limited perception. A new course this semester,
Introduction to the Lenape Language, offers students exposure to the eponymous ancestral tongue of the Philadelphia
area and its precarious contemporary situation as an endangered language. It also provides students with an under-

standing of the quickly disappearing Lenape culture.
Further, Chair of the Linguistics Department Ted
Fernald hopes that the course has the potential to contribute
to the local Lenape community's ongoing effort to not only
preserve but also revitalize its heritage. "We're used to
thinking of colleges and universities offering a standard
package, but Swarthmore is situated in a particular place,
one with a history, and it doesn't have to be the same as
everywhere else," he said, adding that "We've got this going
on in our backyard... I wanted to see if there was something
we could do to help."
So far, the class has drawn students keen on being a part
of this revitalization process. "It's learning with a purpose,"
Zack Wiener 'l2 said, adding that he became interested in
language revitalization after attending a talk on language
endangerment by linguistics professor K. David Harrison. "I
came to Swarthmore to do this kind of thing, something
that's not available at other colleges," Wiener said.
Swarthmore is uniquely placed to take part in the Lenape
language revitalization effort. In addition to its location in
the ancestral homeland of the Lenape people, the college is
home to the Friends Historical Library, which contains documents pertaining to Lenape history.
Most significantly, the library contains documents that
discuss the contentious Walking Purchase, also known as
the Walking Treaty of 1737. Long after Perm's death, his
descendants, in need of vast tracts of lands to sell to pay off
debts, presented this treaty to the Lenape, claiming that
Penn and the ancestors of the Lenape had created an unful-

filled agreement which would grant Penn as much land as a
man could walk in a day and a half. Whether William Penn
originally drew up this treaty or not, the descendents managed to claim an area of nearly 70 miles wide by clearing the
path in advance and hiring runners to make the trip.
After the Walking Purchase, the Lenape tribe was scattered to locations across North America, including Ontario,
Wisconsin and Oklahoma, where the most active Lenape
tribes are found. Until recently, the Lenape of Oklahoma didn't recognize the Pennsylvania Lenape as members of the
same tribe. Last May, a Lenape workshop held at the
University of Pennsylvania in conjunction with a conference
on Native American languages in crisis marked the first
time that representatives of different Lenape groups came
together to discuss the future of their culture and language.
The representative of the Lenape Nation of Pennsylvania
was Shelley DePaul, the instructor of Swarthmore's Lenape
Language course. DePaul, a speaker of the Unami dialect of

Lenape, wrote in an email, "My first interest and passion
has always been to learn the language, to re-teach it to the
members of my community, and to work towards its preser-

vation."

According to Fernald, DePaul arrived at the conference

with a curriculum for a Lenape course already prepared.
This led to a meeting, chaired by DePaul, at Swarthmore last

November, during which discussion of a possible Lenape
course at Swarthmore began. "My g0a1.... is to tap into the
most valuable resource [Swarthmore] has to offer its students and to guide and motivate them so that they might
exercise their own creativity and expertise in an effort to
revitalize the language," DePaul wrote. She hopes the course
will increase awareness of the Lenape language and culture.
While acknowledging that the Lenape language course is
still in the experimental stage, Fernald remains 'tautiously
optimistic" about the prospect of further Lenape studies at
Swarthmore. In the future he would like to see collaboration
between the Pennsylvania Lenape community and the college. For now, however, Fernald would just like to make
known the pre-European history of the area in which we
live, a history of which even the most knowledgeable
Swatties are often ignorant.
"People at Swarthmore are really concerned about genocide," Fernald said, 'and they wonder what a society would
look like after it had forgotten about genocide, what a society would look like if it denied its past crimes. They don't
realize that all they have to do is look in a mirror." Thanks
to the new Lenape course, that history is more likely to be
remembered.

Digital Storytelling

Faculty and staff tell stories in the digital age
ALEX HO

ahol@swarthmore.edu

While digital technologies threaten to
further and further isolate our everyday

existence, a small gathering on the
Swarthmore campus found that these tools
could instead be harnessed for the purposes
of communication and community building.
From Jan. 7-9 and 12-14, Information
Technology Services hosted two three-day
Digital Storytelling Workshops that were
attended by 21 staff and faculty members.
Run by the Center for Digital Storytelling, a
California-based non-profit organization,

the workshops gave participants the opportunity to produce a personal video essay and
share a side of themselves less often seen by
their colleagues during the academic year.

Having brought the idea down from her
previous position at Williams College, Chief
Information Technology Officer Gayle
Barton, along with her associate Eric
Behrens, organized the first workshop in
the beginning of June last year. Though only
eight participated, the workshop was so well
received that ITS decided to give staff and
faculty the opportunity twice more this

break.

"We wanted to create an example of a
new genre of digital storytelling, somewhere

14

between personal movie and slideshow,"
Behrens said of the workshop. "During it,
each participant writes an original script,
and then does a voice-over recording from
reading that script. Then, they work with
images and video to lay over the voice-over."
Working with stories of a more personal
interest made it easier for participants of
any technological background to learn the
craft of video editing. "They probably have
photographs or have access to images or
video that are related to the project, so it
makes it easier," Behrens said.
Facilitated by instructors from the
Center for Digital Storytelling, participants
were able to develop their stories with one
another. Becky Robert, the Visitor
Programs Coordinator for tlie Scott
Arboretum, said, "We did something called
story circle, which [was] a way to brainstorm with a group of people and help you
work out your idea."
It turns out that even the most unassuming subject makes for a video essay worth
seeing. As Administrative Assistant of the
Education Studies Department as well as
activist and labor organizer, Kae Kalwaic
had a host of efforts that she could have chosen to narrate for the workshop last summer
as well as her return to a lifelong passion for
figure skating.

Coming into the workshop, Kalwaic said,
"I was kind of torn whether to cover ice
skating or whether to cover activism."
Rather than picking and choosing, her final
product "On the Edge" confronts and reconciles the two activities. The video ends with
Kalwaic recalling an Emma Goldman quote:
"A revolution without dancing is not a revolution worth having."
Since the workshop, Kalwaic has found
herself getting more and more wired in. She
now writes a blog and has created several
more video essays, including a recent one
that documents Obama's train to his inauguration passing by Chester.

Kalwaic is also finding that her newfound videography skills are more and more
useful in her line of work. One of the organizations she is associated with, the DelCo
Alliance for Environmental Justice, recently posted a You Tube video about a tire plant
being constructed in Chester. The video contributed to community awareness, and eventually plans to build the plant were stopped.
"I realized how powerful it was to get something up on YouTube," Kalwaic said, as a
result of DelCo's Alliance success with the
video. "It definitelyis a tool that I'm going to
be using because I think it's something that
speaks to people."

The fruits of the workshop have also

January 22, 2009

found their way into some Swarthmore
classes. Having taken the workshop the past
June, Michael Jones, the Director of the
Language Resource Center, was able to integrate the process into the midterm exams of
three Modern Languages and Literatures
courses last semester by giving its students
a sequence of images that they had to narrate. Jones said, "What you're trying to do
in languages class is you're trying to get people to use some of the vocabulary that
they're learning and reapply it to new circumstances." He plans to apply the activity
to several classes this semester as well.
For Behrens, one ofthe great assets of the
workshop was bringing together a blend of
faculty and staff from different departments.
"I've heard from everybody that that was
one of the really great strengths of it, that
it's a community building exercise," he said.
Even for Professor Weinberg, who does not
have plans to integrate video storytelling
into his teaching, the workshop was "worth
doing."

"It was wonderful because you got to
spend three days with other colleagues,"
Weinberg said. "I got to learn more about
people that I didn't know very much about

because we each had very personal stories
It was a very welcoming place for
people to bare their souls."

In June of 2007 I was diagnosed with
obsessive compulsive disorder.
I apologize, because OCD is really
boring. Understand that nothing would
please me more than to captivate you
with thrilling true stories of invisible
talking llamas and publicly shitting

myself.
Perhaps I might have hallucinated

that I was Jesus and taught everyone

simple truths about loving and living;

they could make a movie of my life and
I'd be played by Robin Williams in a
critically-derided performance. But
OCD isn't entertaining, nor is it
enlightening. It isn't even sexy, and
believe me, I'd love to have a 'sexy'
mental illness, scowling and smoking,
writing mediocre poetry to express my
inner tormention, with attractive
women throwing themselves at me, convinced they could 'fix' me, and me not
necessarily saying anything to discourage them. It's too bad. I bet I could totally pull off the tortured artist thing.
Unfortunately my disorder has rendered me genial and non-threatening,
and my truly heroic consumption of
prescription medication over the years
has spoiled my taste for recreational
narcotic abuse. Also, if a girl accepts an
invitation to help count the tiles on
your bedroom ceiling, then she will
probably be disappointed when she
realizes you were speaking literally.
So, yeah, obsessive compulsive disorder. If it's any consolation, I wasn't
especially thrilled when I learned about
it either.
OCD is an anxiety disorder. It is
rooted in a pathological intolerance of
uncertainty and the development of
elaborate neutralizing rituals in hopes
of eliminating it. Some obsessive-compulsives struggle with contamination
and wash their hands repeatedly; some

ner of symptom your narrator suffers
from.
I have suffered from OCD since early
childhood. My primary symptoms
involve recurring intrusive thoughts;
others include perfectionism, minor
contamination issues, social passivity
(occasionally I can muster up some passive-aggression if I'm feeling saucy),
scrupulosity (OCD plus Jesus), low selfesteem and generalized social anxiety
(it is a tremendous relief to have a verified medical explanation for my personal manifestation of the Swarthmore
Awkward, not unlike having a note
from your mother to excuse you from
gym class). I began to see a therapist
when I was six. In high school, I was
misdiagnosed with depression and put
on medication, which I took until the
end of my freshman year of college.
After discontinuing the medication, my
symptoms began to escalate, exacerbated by academic stress and an unhealthy
Vicious-and-Spungen-level
relationship. In early July of 2007 I had a nervous breakdown and was admitted to
McLean Hospital. I subsequently spent
the fall of 2007 in a residential program
for obsessive-compulsives.
Over the
next fourteen weeks, I will be writing
about my experiences with mental illness.
Some of you who are familiar with
my previous writing, may be surprised
by this dramatic shift in tone and content. I regret to inform any sensitive
readers that my column this semester
may be "dark," "agonizing," and possibly "an inappropriate public exorcism
of personal psychological demons." I
will also use cuss words. Already, I can
predict the response of the disenfranchised and grievously offended. "Hey.
You're that guy who wrote stuff that
was kind of funny. What the hell,
F

form of "arrow-maker" is not strictly
speaking a four-letter word. But I
digress.

I need to explain my reasons for

on the 'Why so serious?'
Detroit DJ scene

Thoughts

Lauren Ramanathan
The Margo Channing Report
mmam^^^^^^^^mmmm

Since my home state of Michigan has been in the
headlines a lot lately, I've decided to write about an
experience that I recently had in the infamous Motor
City. Every last Friday of the month is "Funk
Night," meaning a group of DJs gets together and
throws a crazy dance party in an abandoned warehouse in downtown Detroit (the name of which shall
remain anonymous, not that the Detroit police are
reading this, and even then they've got worse problems on their hands).
Winter break was my opportunity to see what the
big and bad city of Detroit is all about. I went with a
friend and three of her friends (who shall again
remain anonymous). There were five of us, three of
whom were people of color. Now, I mention this
because of Detroit DJ culture's much storied "race
issue."

Juan Atkins, inventor of Techno, and his compa
triots were African American. But they chose
monikers that "repudiated] ethnic designations," so no one could tell. And so
Techno found a mostly white audience. Meaning that all in all, the Detroit Techno
narrative is just another one of the white appropriations ofblack music. [l]
So I was not surprised to find myself one of the few people of color at the venue
aside from the "security" guards (who accepted cannabis bribes for cuts in line) and,
of course, the DJs. The whole issue was just accentuated by the constant thump of
funk music in the background.
But all racial politics aside,
once I actually got to the dance
floor, I had fun
surprisingly
enough.' And that's when it
struck me. What is the meaning of
a bunch of kids who presumably
aren't from Detroit coming to get

...

city?
Apparently not much. Or so it
would seem. Everyone seemed to
be having a great time. Drunk
(white) people kept on bumping
into me, but that's just to be
expected wherever there are
drinking white people.
But, really, should I have been
feeling guilty about the colonial
tones of this venture? I wondered
how many of the people in the
crowd had thought seriously
about the bailout, Kwame
Kilpatrick's corrupt leadership or
the fact that Michigan's economy
Sarah Chaslns Phoenix Staff K is now trailing that of just about
every other state in the nation.
But this all leads me back to an important question about the politics ofleisure.
Shouldn't we all have just been enjoying ourselves at that party? Which begs the
question: In a faltering economy, do we have the right to enjoy ourselves? Is partying a necessity, or is the "Work Hard, Play Hard" ethic just for the privileged?
It is wholly possible that an event such as "Funk Night" is a place where lonely
souls go to forget their troubles, socioeconomic and existential alike. But when the
makeup of the crowd is so obviously hipster and so obviously privileged, what does
that say about who can even afford the luxuries of temporary amnesia that the weekend proffers?
Perhaps this whole editorial is problematic, as it tacitly assumes that the underprivileged don't party. Perhaps it is just that the venues I have frequented are not
the milieus where non-white, middle class people tend to party, and the fact that I
have mainly been exposed to spaces dominated by privilege is certainly only a product of my own privilege.
The points that I am trying to get at here are numerous. Chief among them: Is it
appropriate, or even necessary, to constantly feel guilty during times of local turmoil? What does it say about our society that we seem to exotify the abject, the
crime-ridden, the sorrowful? Does the party hard ethic only apply to a certain privileged subset of society, who subsequently justify their hedonism using the sobering
realities of economic and political ruin that keep so many others constantly worried
about how they are simply going to make it through the next day?
I don't know the answers. But at least I'm starting to find the questions.

it's not surprising that this time around Marc
Jacobs focuses his collection on "the joy of
dressing up." Mixing colors, fabrics, embellishments, prints and anything and everything under the sun, the collection is a hodgepodge of looks that holds up well. The vision
is there, but the very vision itself seems set

collection does nothing short of encapsulating the sense of fashion fun she has maintained throughout those years. Models come
strutting down the runway with exuberance,
clothed in outfits with sequins, tiers, ruffles
and appliques. Big frizzy hair, oversized sunglasses and variations on the classic French

itself up a notch with unconventional poses,
rainbow colors and confetti: lots and lots of

dead-eyed and sallow no-smiles look, the
models actually seem like they feel good in

Critics of the fashion industry may lambast it for being shallow, but there are two
sides to the coin. Yes, the industry can lack

fashion is so self-absorbed. At the end of the

is the one we should be asking through these

that could have been spent
watching Total Request
Live with oh-so-dreamy Carson Daly). Had this '9os R&B
singer gone to Swarthmore, you lewd liberals who keep
your condoms on display on your night stand (you know
who you are) might have turned your noses up at Monica
and her preachy songs about the one-night-stand. But let
me tell you something: all that getting down does not
come without its consequences.
Oh yes, I said consequences, and I'm not talking about
the kind that burn in your underwear. No, these consequences are imminent, ominous and dire. They are far
more stingy and uncomfortable. They are the kind you
would only encounter at Swarthmore. And I will tell you
what they are because I have experienced them first
hand, and for this reason and this reason alone, I envy
the restraint that Monica preached in 1998. Oh, lord, do
I envy her restraint.
It was a dark and stormy night, and I chose to seek
refuge in the warmth of the DU basement. It was one of
the first parties of the year and I was coming down with
a very classic case of the 'Oh-my-god-I'm-so-hornys.' It's
a very dangerous condition, really, because, like rabies,
once this disease takes a hold of a human being, there is
no hope for him/her until provided with the antidote.
The infected becomes ravenous with animalistic and
aggressive qualities, and attempts to impede the trajectory of the rabid are futile.
And so, my lustfulness, combined with my over-tired
state which often produces symptoms in me as would a
large amount of Tequila in others enabled me to overlook several warning signs in my intended target, who
for anonymity's sake I shall call 'Buddy Jones' from this
point forth. The first warning sign was that Buddy was
getting mighty close with his probably-crush; let's call
her 'Sally Smith.' The two were seen canoodling recumbent on the DU basement couch where all the coats were
strewn about. Yet after they disappeared in what I imagined was a 5-minute tryst, and Buddy returned alone, I
saw the tables had turned as Buddy sat down alone on
the bench outside of the bathroom door. Like a raccoon
(a sexy raccoon), I leapt onto his lap and smiled at him
with my big round eyes. Before I knew it we were making out.
"If I'm gonna be with you," Buddy said, "I don't want
to be with you here."
"Let's go somewhere else," I said.
As if propelled by a sudden uncontrollable momentum, Buddy and I rocketed halfway up the stairs and fluttered out of the side door of DU. Buddy took my hand and
led me toward the WRC, which happened to be the most
convenient building speaking in terms of proximity, but
blast! His plan was foiled when the large wooden door
was inexplicably bolted shut. To be honest, I was rather
horrified that he would try to seduce me in such a place,
especially when we both had perfectly good singles, but I
decided to ignore this second warning sign and told him
that "we should go somewhere else."
By the time we finally approached Hallowell, a mutual understanding had been reached. A passer-by confirmed this when he smiled and cooed at us, "haaavvve
funnn yooou twooo!" Buddy and I now holding hands
like two star-crossed lovers responded to this by looking
each other square in the eye and cackling. It must have
been 3 in the morning. I ripped my key into the lock and
the next thing I knew I was being thrown down onto the
mattress pad with full force. Buddy had gone wild.
Now when I'm especially attracted to a guy, and he
gets intense with me, he will pretty much make me go
crazy. So when Buddy got ferocious, I was inspired to initiate things that are generally reserved for couples only,

positions that are so sacred, for example, that middleschoolers agonize over their meaning because they are
encoded with titles that include double-digit numbers.
But despite this wildly intense hookup, Buddy suddenly
got weird when we were through. He seemed to be coming down with something equally as dangerous as my
case of OMGISH (which had been miraculously eradicated only moments ago). As he lay there with an impassive
look on his face muttering something about having to go
back and "take out" his "contact-lenses," it hit me like a
sucker-punch: Buddy had just switched into buddy mode.
"I hope this doesn't affect our friendship," Buddy
said, as he fastened his belt-buckle. If only we had actually been friends before, I thought to myself as I walked
him to the door and nodded as nonchalantly as I could.
And then Buddy did something I will never forget: the
most untimely and perverse gesticulation that has ever

Hesitating for an instant, I decided it would be worse for
the both of us if I left him hanging rather than just
enduring the shame of a single fist bump. But oh, the
sting of that instant will be forever branded onto my
knuckles.
And so Buddy and I went our separate ways. We have
had an occasional conversation, but we keep the interactions to the minimum primarily because the awkwardness is at an all-time high. My point in taking on a column of such a taboo nature is that I would like to not
only entertain you Swarthmorians, but also send you a
message or two. This week it's for those of you (us) cavalier sex-havers. It's time you all grow a pair. Start accepting the imminent dire consequences of your sexcapades.

Swarthmore, remember.
So, to Hell with it. Next Sunday Brunch, maybe you
will acknowledge the boy you saw naked less than 3
hours ago, or maybe you will continue making your girlfriend refill your orange juice until he leaves. Not for my
sake, but for your own sake and for the sake of your own
"Buddy," please: just be decently friendly. They will not

OldeClub

Ra Ra Riot rocks Olde Club (for real this time)

BY DAISY SCHMITT
dschmittl@swarthmore.edu

After what was hopefully a relaxing winter break,
Swarthmore students had best ready themselves to get shaken up once again at Olde Club this weekend. When the
planned Ra Ra Riot show was cancelled last semester, disappointment was plentiful. But absence makes the heart grow
fonder, and now anticipation for the show is especially high.
Another exciting factor is the return of Madalyn Baldanzi
'OB, Meredith Leich 'OB and Anna Ghublikian 'OB, who will be
joining Zach Weinstein 'll in the form of the up-and-coming
band Soldier On Dear Friend.

Back in December, illness in Ra Ra Riot caused the last
Olde Club show of the semester to be cancelled. "We decided
right then and there, though, thatwe'd do whatever we could
to reschedule," Olde Club Coordinator Charlie Decker 'O9
said. "Ra Ra Riot had been my top target ever since I was
hired as Booking Director, so I wasn't about to let them get
away." Decker, who has seen Ra Ra Riot live five times, says
"you can tell that they're having a great time on stage, and
that they love each other and what they do."
Ra Ra Riot stands apart from the indie crowd music-wise,
as well. A cellist and a violinist add a special layer to their
sound, which has been described by NPR as "swooning" and
"sinuous." This originality helped them burst prominently
onto the music scene withthe release of their first full-length
album, "The Rhumb Line," in August. They began as a
group of friends with a mutual love of music at Syracuse
University and have quickly skyrocketed to fame and critical acclaim. In 2007, the band faced a difficult obstacle, the

on their album, which has a palpable melancholy to it along
with its beauty and catchiness.
The members of Ra Ra Riot have definitely put themselves on the map, and their opener, Soldier On Dear Friend,
is following in their footsteps. When SODF began last year
at Swarthmore, it was mostly for fun. "Madalyn and I just
wanted to make music together, so we wrangled up Meredith
and Zach and started a cover band," guitarist Ghublikian
said. However, as time went on, things became more serious. After writing some of their own songs and recording an
EP over the summer, SODF came to a realization, deciding
to "give the whole band thing a try," bassist Baldanzi said.
"We're starting to play around New York and Philly. We're
hoping to get back into the studio soon to record a whole
bunch of new songs and work on some of the old ones."
In fact, SODF is coming to Olde Club fresh off their New
York debut at the Annex. "We weren't in the familiar setting
of Olde Club, and since we decided to take our band more
seriously now that most of us are done with school, the
stakes seem a lot higher," Ghublikian said. And it keeps getting better; opening for Ra Ra Riot is a big step for the band,
as they continue to grow as an ensemble.
They seem, however, to be developing a definite and
coherent style all their own. When asked about their inspirations, Ghublikian cited artists which range from "Korean
folk tunes to Kate Bush, from Bach to Beirut," Andrew Bird,
The Decemberists, and, as a matter of fact, Ra Ra Riot. The
Decemberists comparison is especially helpful in under-

standing the essence of SODF; their songs tell intricate stories and give great importance to the small, beautiful things
in life (such as the Morton Salt Girl, a subject of one of their
songs).

It is also clear that the diversity of the band members'
musical backgrounds is very important to the evolution of
their sound. Both Ghublikian and Leich are classically
trained violinists. Baldanzi is, according to Leich, a "serious
connoisseur of rock," and Weinstein has quite a bit of experience playing both guitar and drums in bands, coupled with
recording knowledge. "At Swarthmore, I minored in music,
so I learned a lot ofmusic theory and history and was able
to play in more classical groups than [is] healthy, but... lam
embarrassingly ignorant regarding pop music," Leich said,
who, post-Swarthmore, has been catching up on the past 50
years of rock. "In any event," she said, "I think that our
musically diverse backgrounds really enrich what we're
able to play together."
Both Soldier On Dear Friend and Ra Ra Riot are testaments to the power of the love of music. Despite death, distance and other obstacles, both bands have come out even
stronger, making music that is powerful and yet accessible
and creating seemingly unbreakable bonds. Both bands
combine a multitude of musical talents, creating a unique
sound. Both are comprised entirely ofpassionate people who
love what they do. And both will be at Olde Club this Friday
in a show that cannot be missed.

Philly Concerts

Exploring the off-campus music scene in Philly
BY LIANA KATZ
lkatzl@swarthmore.edu

If getting off campus more was one of
your New Year's resolutions, Philadelphia's
winter concert line-up will make it an easy
one to fulfill (unlike going to the gym or
becoming a functional adult). With everyone
from rappers to aging classic rockers making their way through the city, this winter
guarantees shows for all tastes. Here are
some intermittent highlights for the upcoming months:
. Nappy Roots, January
22 at North
Star Bar

Kentucky natives Nappy Roots have
released a platinum-selling album and have
a calendar day named after them in their
home state. However, since their recent
departure from Atlantic Records, the quintet
is deviating from the well-worn Southern
rap path. With their latest album,
"Humdinger," Nappy Roots are leaning
more towards slow rhymes backed by a combination of synthesized beats and clean guitar melodies. Fully enjoying their status as
newly independent artists, Nappy Roots are
looking to surprise and challenge their fans.
Dar Williams, January 24 at The
Keswick Theater

Dar Williams has been an important fixture in the contemporary folk scene since
she began performing with Joan Baez in the

18

early '9os. For almost two decades, Williams
has been making poignant music that
explores the depths of everything from trou-

bled childhood memories to gender stereotypes. Williams consistently allows her
sound to evolve by breaking artistic boundaries. In recent years she has fleshed out the
richness of her vocals and collaborated with
Ani Difranco on a cover of "Comfortably
Numb" on her 2005 album "My Better Self."
Her most recent release, September's
"Promised Land," includes-a selection of her
eloquent songwriting as well as covers from
Hedwig and the Angry Inch and Fountains
of Wayne.
Andrew Bird, January 25 at The
Theater of the Living Arts
Although he once trained to be a classical
concert violinist, Andrew Bird could not
keep his hands off a host of other instruments. Experimenting with glockenspiels,
guitars, and his own vocal chords, Bird
crafts multilayered tracks that are at once
vibrantly lush and gently ironic. His live
performances become a delicate balancing
act as Bird, with a sparse backup band, plays
multiple instruments at once. Bird will
release his latest album, "Noble Beast," five
days before his Philadelphia show and is
bound to showcase his new tracks alongside
older favorites.
Lykke Li, January 30 at The First
Unitarian Church

Although her real name (Li Lykke
Timotej Zachrisson) is a bit complicated,
this Swedish-born indie poptart's music is
anything but. With her main stated influence being "Jane Birkin with no top on," Li
fuses sparse hand-clap beats with sweet
vocals to create a sound that is both
ethereal and provocative. Singinj
about personal heartbreak and
hardship, Li often allows hj
emotional side to shine
through during her shows
with intermittent yelps
and whispers. All Li
asks in return is that
her listeners enjoy
themselves. "I just want
people to have a good

original music. With rough lyrics and meandering guitar riffs, listening to the Black
Keys is akin to taking a hipster time warp
back to the days of 45s and Led Zeppelin. In
accordance with their classic sound, the

and

The changing media
Change was promised in the 2008 election, and
change was given. Hillary Clinton was the first female
candidate to come close to securing her party's nomination; Sarah Palin was the first female Republican to
be nominated for vice-president; North Carolina voted
Democratic for the first time in 30 years; and, most
memorably of all, America elected its first black president. The election, however, did more than magnify
America's changing demographic and social trends. It
proved, once and for all, that new media

There isn't anything wrong with this trend. Blogs,
from the Drudge Report on the right to the Huffington
Post on the left, regularly break stories that are missed
by the mainstream media (or, in blog lingo, "the
MSM"). If, as Thomas Jefferson would have had it, the
press serves as a final check on government, then it is
difficult to imagine a surer watchdog than a citizenry
armed with video cameras. Already, a newly empowered American citizenry has used new media to
expose police abuse at home, while activists abroad
have used cameras and blogs to smuggle out images
from countries ruled by repressive regimes.
So by no means is The Phoenix standing "athwart
history, shouting stop!" However, there is still an
inherent value to maintaining some traditional methods of journalism. In a society where everyone with
an Internet connection has the capacity to be a journalist, it is still valuable to have copy editors and fact
checkers, to have reporters cite multiple sources and
to have people hired expressly to investigate the workings of government. There is still a value to having
careful, meticulous, relatively unbiased reporting.
And it is our hope that whatever revolutions overtake
the media industry and society at large these important elements of the old media remain and all journalists be held accountable for the accuracy of the state-

But a closer look at The New York Times shows
that no matter how innovative the paper is, the market
for newspapers is quickly disappearing. The New
York Times has been forced to lay off employees and,
by allowing non-subscribers to view their website for
free, it runs the risk of losing print subscribers. In
early January, the paper sold its first front-page advertisement, and just four days ago the New York Times
Corporation received a $250 billion loan (bailout) from
Carlos Slim Helu, the Mexican entrepreneur who currently stands as the second wealthiest man in the
world. Ironically, many bloggers have questioned why
the paper would allow a man who was referred to by a
New York Times editorial writer as a "robber baron"
to own such a large stake in the company. There has
always been a tension between news organizations'
roles as both profit-seeking vehicles and as crusaders
for a more transparent society. This tension is only
going to be exacerbated in the current climate, when
news organizations are forced to scavenge for advertisements and attract new readers and viewers.
We have no idea what is going to happen to news in
the next couple of years. But we hope that, no matter
how the industry changes, basic journalistic standards remain.

Happy new year, Democrats; 2009 will be hard

column of the Obama
administration, I have
some words for his
Democratic supporters.)
2008 was quite a year,
wasn't it? You poured your
heart, soul, sweat, tears
and the contents of your
wallet into a campaign that
changed the way people
campaign.

Some of you saw your

allegiances change as the
supporting
characters

slowly stepped aside, only to see many of them return for
the grand finale (Clinton! Biden! Richar- well, at the end
of 2008 he was still riding high). You gave Barack Obama
the keys to the White House, as well as permission to
change the locks once the Bush administration was safely outside.
Congratulations! Get ready for a much, much harder

year.
That might seem surprising. None of the major adverGeorge Bush and Dick
saries of 2008 are in power
Cheney have vanished, John McCain has declared himself the "loyal opposition," and Sarah Palin is safely back
in Alaska. Democrats may not be happy with all of
Obama's policies, but when comparing him to the people
who were calling the shots in 'OB, they'll probably be pretty satisfied.
So why is 2009 going to be the harder year? No one will
disagree that a lot of work needs to be done to fix our policies, our politics and our priorities. Yet this was true in
2008. There are several things, however, that make 2009
different.
In 2009, the work that remains will be harder to do.
Not everyone eager to bring about change worked for a
campaign this past year. But many of them did, and for
those people, finding another means to make change will
be challenging. This is normal in non-election years in
American democracy. Unless you are A) constitutionally
empowered to create government policy or B) a well-connected lobbyist, it is much simpler to work for a change
in politicians than in policies.
-

Everyone knows the tools they have to sway politicians voting, volunteering, voicing opinions to friends
and neighbors to try to persuade them but what does it
take to change American policy on Darfur? Or healthcare? Or gay marriage? It's certainly possible for citizen
organizations to influence these and other issues, but
doing so takes creativity, persistence and patience with
the fact that the results of effective activism will be subtler and harder to identify than the swearing-in of a new
leader.
In 2009 this type of work will be harder to find. For
many of us in 2008, it was impossible to not know ways to
get involved our inboxes were crammed with requests
for help, our phones rang with auto-dialers recruiting
volunteers, and practically everyone knew someone who
volunteered every weekend. But n0w...?
For perhaps the first time, I'm thankful I signed up for
79 different mailing lists at the Freshman Activities Fair.
Both of these difficulties for 2009 are common to both
Democrats and Republicans, and though serious, they
essentially represent the status quo for American democracy. The last problem, however, is one that Democrats
have not had to grapple with in a long time.
As for Obama's swearing-in, the Democrats major
political antagonists will be gone. Barack Obama is the
President, and Democrats have firm control of the House
and Senate. This is a gain for Democratic causes arid
potentially a major problem for Democratic activism.
Why? Because activism is all about opposition, and
people tend to be lousy at opposing people they generally
support.
People have a problem with "cognitive dissonance,"
which Wikipedia helpfully defines as 'an uncomfortable
feeling caused by holding two contradictory ideas simul-

-

-

-

taneously."

In this case, because most Democrats are generally
supportive of President Obama, they will tend to rationalize and defend many of the controversial positions he
will inevitably take.
Think back to the Democratic primaries, when the
policy differences between then-Senators Obama and
Clinton were dwarfed by the candidates' similarities.
Despite this, on nearly every issue, strong Obama or
Clinton supporters I talked to were convinced that their
candidate was right. Why should somebody who joined
the Obama campaign because of his leadership style necessarily assume his healthcare plan is better? This phenomenon is part psychological; it is also part political,

with people afraid that defending a rival could be seen as
a critical concession, and a sign of weakness. John
McCain's campaign tried to play on these fears, actually
running an ad after the first presidential debate playing
up the number of times Obama said he agreed with
McCain.
It is true that not all Democrats suffer from this inability to criticize the leaders they support. For many, the
reaction to this tendency goes to the other extreme,
approaching complete cynicism about political leaders.
This can be acceptable if it motivates people to work hard
for change regardless of who is in power. There are several major risks to cynicism, however: it can discourage
activism, it can keep people from understanding their
leaders as people (which can be an important part of
understanding how to influence them), not to mention
that cynics tend to make uninspiring leaders. Cynicism
may be better than following blindly, but it's not what we
need to affect positive change.
So, Democratic activists, here is your challenge:
oppose your political leaders on'something. That may
sound silly deliberately seeking a point of disagreement
just for the sakeof doing so but that is an important step
everyone should take. Why? Because if you're only finding areas of agreement, then you are limiting your own
ability to participate in American democracy.
You can lobby your Congressmen to support elements
of the Obama agenda (something you may consider doing
anyway), but you won't be doing anything to influence
the agenda itself.
You don't need to do this right away. Give the Obama
administration some time to give us a clearer image of its
true priorities and policy preferences. After that? Find a
disagreement. Tell people about it. Say, "I like what ,
Obama is doing with the economy, but whatever happened to repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell?" Ask whether
he's got the right strategy in Afghanistan. Question his
biases, his details, his advisors. And don't be afraid to
admit it you might even want to practice being vocally
critical.
And what then? If you get through this, then congratulations, you've gotten around the third problem for
Democrats in 2009. But the other problems are, of course,
still there: the work will still be harder now, and the
options will be harder to find.
It's going to be a hard year. Let's get started.

would relate how he planned to become
stateless and sail around the world if
called upon to serve. As the Bush era
draws to a close, I have wondered how I
might explain these troubled years of war
and fear to a younger generation. And
then I realized what a boring story it
would be. At best I could tell of some antiwar marches in 2003 before the invasion of
Iraq, and then more to protest the 2004
Republican National Convention in New
York. (That time it was personal; they had

THE PHOENIX

invaded our turf, and I remember an energy in those marches that my other experiences never matched.)
On the second anniversary of the start
of the war, I was in tenth grade and
posters everywhere urged kids to skip
school to attend a march. Predictably,
that protest was wildly popular, and
legions of adolescents turned out in the
name of missing Chemistry. We marched
from Union Square to 42nd Street as
teenagers slyly tipped dubious-looking

water bottles to their mouths. Eventually
people started making out, which you
might imagine slowed things down.
And that was it. Anti-war sentiment
flared once in a while, but it seemed to
become a little passe. Where young adults
congregated there was no talk of the war.
In concert venues, high school choruses
sang ironic songs about emotions; in
Greenwich Village cafes, the big deal was
fair trade coffee. Poetry clubs beat out
feats of aesthetic innovation largely
devoid of any political message. I suppose
I can't blame my generation for failing to
care too much. Without the carnal fear of
the draft, without higher taxes, without
rationing or sacrifice of any kind, life for
a middle class non-military family was
more or less hunky dory until perhaps
when the economy nose-dived in 2008.
But it is that disconnect—between the
horror and shame of the Bush years and

the relative comfort that most people
enjoyed—that is so troubling. Like an animal without a nervous system, Americans
could enjoy life as normal while an administration misled them into a war, while
improvised explosive devices ripped
through US soldiers, while hundreds of
thousands of Iraqis were killed.
At best, we maintained a serious but
removed trepidation for our country, for
its principles and soldiers. But as for storytelling, I think my grandkids would
shush me if I sat them down on my knee
and explained how concerned I was about
habeas corpus in aught-six.
Cultural critics, especially those on the
right, relish each chance to point out that
our generation is less radical than our
parents were. They tell us that we are
more interested in making money than
changing the world, more invested in the
pomp of bouquets than the power of flowers. Maybe that helps explain our muffled
response to the Iraq war. But perhaps we
are less active on behalf of our country
because we have less of a stake in it; that
is, our necks are safe no matter how many
wars we start. A worthwhile question to
ponder is how much damage to the United
States—both from enemies and from ourselves—might have been averted during
the Bush years if the draft were still in
effect.
Bush might have started the Iraq War,

January 22, 2009

but he certainly wouldn't have been able
to continue it as long as he did or wage it
with the singular authority he insisted
was his executive power. Imagine how
vocal congressmen would be if they were
receiving thousands ofcalls per day from
young constituents who didn't want to die
in an unjustified war. I realize it is both
odd and futile to hope for something as
terrible and politically unpopular as a
draft, but the pain of conscription might
have grounded the nation in the grim realities of war and unsaddled a whole lot
sooner the swaggering cowboy who led
the charge.
Or, a more optimistic prognosis is that
we are simply more interested in voting
than marching, as evidenced by the millions of young people who registered in
order to cast ballots for Obama and the
multitudes who volunteered in his campaign. The fervor of the President's young
supporters holds testament to, among
other things, their faith in the System. For
baby boomers, however, that modicum of
trust disappeared in 1968 with the assassination of Robert Kennedy, the riots at the
Democratic National Convention, and the
fact that anti-war candidate Eugene
McCarthy didn't win the nomination.
So here's to the Bush years—we're glad
they're gone.

'Thief' a big risk Drive yields standout races for track

Somewhere
in
Lewiston,
Maine, there is a thrift store
endowed with a surplus of
Starbury apparel. Largely unfamiliar with this brand until my
friend arrived home with a $7 pair
of Starbury shoes and two $7
Starbury jerseys, I wanted to delve
into its founder and his current
status. Of course, I am speaking of
the enigma that is Stephon
Marbury. During break, rumors
began swirling that the troubled
Kevin Friedenberg
New York Knicks guard may land
Get Down With
in Boston. As a de facto Celtics fan,
I was naturally intrigued.
Your Bad Self
Given his current situation
with the New York Knicks franchise, perhaps it is time for
Marbury to accept Mark Blount's nickname of "The Thief." At
first glance, it is easy to assume that perhaps this refers to some
sort of uncanny or innate defensive ability. In actuality, "The
Thief refers to Marbury's ability to drain money from the
Knicks franchise while not once setting foot on the court.
Marbury is pulling in a cool $20.8 million to not play; theKnicks
are essentially paying him to stay away from the team. The cynic
in me wants to say, "Stephon, you are living the dream, buddy.
Being paid some silly money to do nothing." Taking a step back,
however, and examining (A) the economy and (B) the integrity of
sports as we know it, I feel a little outraged that this is going on.
In the most recent news I have heard, Marbury is willing to
give the Knicks back $1 million in exchange for a contract buyout that would allow him to play for another team (speculation
points toward the Celtics), who reportedly made him an offer.
If it is the Celtics, I have mixed feelings. Interestingly, after
exploding to a red-hot start this season, the Celtics dropped a bad
stretch of games when talks of Marbury coming to Boston started. Coincidence, or distraction? The question, of course, with a
player like Marbury (a two-time all star) is whether the benefit
of his talent is worth the possible disruptions that he may cause.
His success in a situation like this one seems to depend not only
on the athlete himself, but also on the coaching staff ofhis new
team. Take, for example, Randy Moss' exile from the Raiders to
the Patriots. Much controversy surrounded whether Moss would
change his distracting ways for the benefit of the team. Of
course, as the story goes, "The Warden" Bill Belichick tolerates
no nonsense, and the Patriots produced some of the best offense
in NFL history, but I digress.

Caitlin Mullarkey 'O9 proved to be
just as potent a force on the track

as in the classroom, setting a
school record for the indoor mile
with a time of 5:08.82. Only one
other female runner at the meet,
which hosted an array ofDivision I
and Division 111 athletes alike, beat
Mullarkey's time that day. She and
teammate Hodson were honored as
Centennial Co-Indoor Track
Field Athletes of the Week as.a
result of their outstanding runs.
Hodson ran an all-time personal
best in the mile with a time of
4:38.56. Bess Ritter 'O9 also beat her
personal record in the mile, crossing the finish line at 5:26.54.
Kenyetta Givans 'l2 made her hurdle debut, finishing second in her
heat and posting a time of 9.56.
Distance runners who ran
throughout the cross-country season could use their fall fitness as a
starting point this winter, but some
athletes were making other transitions, coming off of seasons playing
other sports. Mullarkey, for example, is also a member of the
women's soccer team, which competes inthe fall. While the types of
training and fitness obviously differ between the two sports, "track
is much more team-oriented than
most people realize," Mullarkey
said. "You rely on your teammates

In the words of co-captain Dan
Hodson 'O9, the Swarthmore men's
and women's indoor track teams
are prepared to "pay any price" and
"bear any burden to win every
race."
Head Coach Pete Carroll's version of the team goals are slightly
less dire, but no less ambitious.
Simply put, his aim is to have each
athlete perform to the best of his or
her ability. "The trick," he said, "is
the timing of thej>erformance."

Timing certainly seems to be
working out this winter for the
Swarthmore track teams, whose
members have already posted several personal bests and recordbreaking times at the first two
meets. The teams traveled to
Haverford College to compete in
the Jack Pyrah Meet on Dec. 5, and
later to the University ofDelaware

for the Delaware Invitational on
Jan. 9.

Swat fared very well in both
meets. At the Jack Pyrah Meet, sev-

eral athletes had excellent showings. Co-captain Kathy Feeney 'O9
won the mile in 5:27.03, while men's
co-captain Connor Darby 'O9 placed
first in the 800 meter run in 2:00.52.
Swarthmore also saw positive
results
from the Delaware
Invitational. In addition to a solid
team performance, some individual standouts emerged at the meet.

to train everyday in practice, to
help you through the workouts and
races."

The coaches also serve as an

integral part of the training experi-

ence. Coaches Pete Carroll and
John Noon often participate in
team runs, including the Monday
"'hammer' runs," so-called by
Hodson "because they run with us
and just hammer and hammer
until they're left with only one runner by the end." Assistant Coach
Tom Reynolds works closely with
the athletes participating in field
events.
All three coaches had
extremely successful track and
field careers at the collegiate level.
While Mullarkey, Hodson and
several other upperclassmen will

experience and skill to the team,
several new faces have also made
their mark.
"Kenyetta Givans 'l2 was a state
level hurdler in PA last year in
high school," Coach Carroll said.
Fellow first-year Melissa Frick 'l2
was also a state level distance runner in high school and joins the
squad after an outstanding debut
season with the Garnet cross-country team this fall. "She'll be one to
watch," Carroll said of Frick, who
is currently recovering from an
injury. He also cited Daniel Ly 'l2
as 'an extremely talented triple and
long jumper" who could have a
future impact in conference scoring.

.

The cynic in me wants to say, "Stephon,
you are living the dream, buddy. Being
paid some silly money to do nothing."
It is also rumored that, because the Knicks don't want
Marbury around the team, he bought himself a courtside ticket
to a game, just like a real fan! The saga between Marbury and
theKnicks is far from over. The choice about whether to accept
thereturned salary money from Marbury and agree to the contract buyout now lies with James Dolan, the owner of the New
York Knicks. Though I don't agree that Marbury should be
allowed to conduct himself in the way he has, I don't think that
the Knicks should continue to let him be paid for services not
rendered.
Consider this: at present, Marbury is commanding a 2009
salary of $2l million. Meanwhile, Celtics star Kevin Garnett is
reportedly earning just under $25 million, except he actually
plays and adds incredible leadership intangibles to the franchise. I fail to see the value of keeping the disgruntled Marbury
on the payroll, because he does not bring to the table any real
contributions that the'Knicks could use. Without a highly productive season in several years, it seems clear that Marbury's
welcome amongst the blue-and-orange is well worn out, and the
only question pending his release is who is willing to take a
chance on the troubled talent.
Perhaps this ongoing episode is why Marbury's clothing line
can only be found at select stores. Inexplicably, Starbury athletic footwear seems to fall apart quickly, like a McDonald's Happy
Meal toy. Then again, Marbury's current NBA status doesn't
look terribly promising either.
Kevin is a junior. He can be reached at kfriedel@swarthmore.edu.

Conference playoffs within reach for women's basketball
BY ANDREW

GREENBLATT
agreen3@swarthmore.edu

The Garnet women's basketball team
emerged from an active winter break with a
3-4 showing, posting a record of 2-3 against
Centennial conference opponents. These
results bring the women to 4-4 in conference
play, which allows them to remain in contention to earn a slot in the five-team conference playoff tournament. Swarthmore, currently sitting in seventh place, is caught in a
jam in the middle of the conference rankings
with McDaniel (5-3 CC), Gettysburg (5-3 CC)
and Johns Hopkins (4-3 CC). Despite having
scored two victories over McDaniel so far
this season, frustrating losses against
Gettysburg and Hopkins have made it difficult for the Garnet to become firmly established in playoff contention.
The team is grounded by a balanced
attack led by Melissa Grigsby 'O9 and
Kathryn Stockbower 'IL Grigsby's experience, on-court intensity and tenacious
defense combined with Stockbower's ability

to score in the low post and her knack for
rebounding (she is leading the conference in
both scoring and rebounding, averaging 18.5
points and 15.2 rebounds per game) has elevated the Garnet offense this season. Yet
aside from the star-power that comes with
Stockbower, the Garnet boasts one of the
most impressively balanced teams in the
conference. Three players, Stockbower,
Grigsby and Ceylan Bodur 11 have been
averaging double-digit figures, and a fourth,
Pam Costello 'lO, has been averaging 9.7
points per game. The Garnet is third in the
conference in assists per game at 13.87 and
had all five starters reach double digits
twice over the winter break, a remarkable
feat. Their impressive statistics are the
result of great chemistry, both on and off the

court.

Costello cites the excitement of a real
playoff possibility as a key factor in building
a positive vibe on the team this year, noting
that "everyone is excited for that potential to
become a reality." Aside from developing
effective teamwork on the court, the team

holds yearly rituals to help maintain traditions and try to build camaraderie, including first-year skits, a team favorite. So far,
the team-building exercises are doing wonders to foster a positive team environment,
crucial in integrating first-years into the

team dynamic.
"This is by far my favorite team that I've
ever played on. The girls are fantastic,"
Christina Duron 'l2 said.
Costello adds that, "everyone on the team

is close this year, freshmen included."
Morale is high, and with the Centennial
Conference's leading shot blocker, Summer
Miller-Walfish 11 (who has averaged 2.92
blocks per game), returning to the lineup
after suffering a concussion, things are looking up for the Garnet as they head into the
second half of their schedule. MillerWalfish, who tied the conference record for
most blocks in a single game by tallying ten
in a win over Dickinson early this month,
adds considerably to the depth that has
begun to characterize this Garnet squad.
There is muddle in the middle of the con-

ference this season and with a few key wins,
the Garnet may just find themselves in the
postseason. "Our main focus is defense,"
Bodur said. "When we defend well, we win.
But when our team defense isn't as good,
neither are the results." The Garnet are
going to have to continue to buckle down
defensively in order to push for a top-five
spot, which would land them in the postsea-

son.
"I don't think anyone in the conference
wouldhave expected our team to be a playoff
threat," Costello said. "Our success early on
is really making teams take us seriously."
Indeed, if this balanced team approach continues to bring success to the Garnet, the
first-years may just get stuck with revising
their skits to create the postseason editions.
The Garnet looks to capitalize on three
upcoming conference games in order to
clinch a playoff berth. Wins against
Washington (3-3 CC), Ursinus (2-5 CC) and
Haverford (1-6 CC) could thrust Swarthmore
into a comfortable slot amongst the top

Men's basketball

Men's basketball regroups following difficult dry spell
BY JARED NOLAN
jnolanl@swarthmore.edu
The Swarthmore men's basketball team suffered a
string of losses over the course of winter break. In January
the team has posted seven losses, dropping their overall
record to 1-12 (0-7 in the Centennial Conference). Co-captain Matt Allen 10 called it "by far the hardest stretch of
the season." The last defeat came at the hands of the Johns
Hopkins Blue Jays, who improved to 10T 4 (5-2 CC) with the
60-48 victory.
Danny Walker 'lO (19 points, 7 rebounds) and co-captain
Raul Ordonez 'O9 (12 points, 12 rebounds) led the Garnet in
scoring against Hopkins, but their efforts were not enough
to spoil the career nights of two Johns Hopkins guards.
Senior Collin Kamm and sophomore Leland O'Connor both
posted career highs in points, 22 and 13 respectively.
The teams traded baskets for the first five minutes and
the contest remained competitive for half of the first period. Swarthmore had its last lead of the game with 14 minutes left in the half when center Ordonez made a layup to
put the Garnet up 8-7. From there the Blue Jays went on a
7-0 run, and the closest the Garnet got the rest of the game
came with 11 minutes left in the first half was when Walker,
Swarthmore's leading scorer at 12.6 points per game, sank
a three-pointer to pull the Garnet within one point to 14-13.
Johns Hopkins responded with another run, however,
outscoring Swarthmore 22-10 in the rest of the half to effectively put the game out ofreach for the visiting Garnet.
Despite being unable to cut the deficit to smaller than 11
points in the second half, Swarthmore Head Coach Lee
Wimberley asserted that his team stepped up its defense. "I
felt that the second half against Johns Hopkins was the best
defensive effort of the season," he said. Allen noted the
keys to the defensive improvement. "We turned up the
intensity level and focused on our assignments," he said.
"In the first half we had a lot ofblown assignments."
The extra effort manifested itself in the numbers. The
Blue Jays shot 46 percent from the field in the first half and
were 5-6 from three-point range. After the Garnet clamped
down on defense, Johns Hopkins cooled off and only made
two often three-points shots in the second half and finished
with a field goal percentage of 415 percent. The more active
defense by Swarthmore resulted in the Garnet actually
outscoring the Blue Jays 25-24 in the second half.
Wimberley will look to continue his team's commitment
to defense in the upcoming games, which should come a little easier. "We've played some really good teams," he said.
"The second half of the conference schedule will be easier."
Six out of the seven conference games that the Garnet has
played so far this season have been against teams in the top

Head Coach Lee Wimberley addresses his Garnet basketball squad.
half of the standings. And the Centennial Conference is
strong this year. "Three different teams have been nationally ranked during the season," Wimberley said.
At the midpoint of a rebuilding year, Wimberley offered
some insight into his team. "We've continued to get better
as the season has progressed," he said. "In spite of the fact
that we've only won one game, I've enjoyed coaching this
team the most out of the last ten years. They play their
tails off." Before the season began, the team needed to
improve in two categories: free-throw shooting and

turnovers. Since then, both stats have improved. The freethrow percentage is up almost ten percentage points to 70.4
percent and the turnovers per game are down from 17.4 to
16.8.
Now, however, Wimberley has isolated another statistic
where the Garnet needs to improve: outside shooting. In
the Johns Hopkins game alone, Swarthmore shot 18.8 percent from three-point range. The Blue Jays made 43.8 percent of their threes. The numbers on the season are similar and this discrepancy explains part of why

the Garnet by an

average of 15.2 points per game.
"There were many moments throughout the game
[against Hopkins] in which we made consecutive defensive
stops and a couple of shots could have put us right back in
it," Ordonez said. "Unfortunately, we were not able to convert offensively during these critical points in the game."
However, the lack of scoring is not due to a dearth of
opportunities. "We're getting a lot of good looks but we're
not hitting them," Allen said. Walker's recently stellar
play should also help shot-making. "The last couple of
games I really got focused," he said. "I feel comfortable out
there now. I've found the right driving lanes." Because he
is quicker than most players at his position as a small forward, opposing teams try to stymie him by guarding him
with a point guard. This allows him to post up the smaller
player and then kick the ball to his teammates for outside

shots.
The Garnet's next game is at home against Ursinus (7-7,
3-4 CC) on Saturday, January 24th at 3:OOPM. Swarthmore
looks to reverse the result of the last meeting between these
two teams, which amounted to an 88-54 Ursinus victory.
