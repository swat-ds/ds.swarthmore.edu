No One Submits Platform for Curriculum Committee
Deadline to submit
platforms twice postponed
due to lack of interest
By

Arun Mohan

The deadline to submit platforms for the
vacant student spot on the College's Curriculum Committee, originally planned for this
week, was twicepostponed, pushing the start
of the election process back until September
30 due to the absence of candidates.

The College's CurriculumCommittee consists of eight members, including two students, one of whomis appointed and the other
of whom is elected simultaneously to two
semesters on the committee and on Student
Council. Provost JennieKeith serves as chair.
The committee meets to discuss issues pertaining to the College's curriculum.
Rahul Sakhuja '9B, a former member of
both Student Council and the Curriculum
Committee, said the committee meets "biweekly." Thus, a student would be required
to attend Student Council and two Curriculum Committee meetings each week. During

Sakhuja's term, the primary focus of the
Committee was the renewal and creation of
concentrations. "My voice wasn't a token
voice at all," said Sakhuja. "I felt that I could
contribute something."
Sakhuja chose not to run this term, however, because he hopes to focus his "energies
in different way...l'd been on Student Council for a year and a half and I felt that letting
new energy into Student Council was the
direction I wanted the Council to go in."
Neena Shenai '99 ran unopposed for the
position last semester, but did not receive
enough votes to be elected, thus leaving the

position vacant and necessitating the current
election. Shenai attributed the current lack of
candidates to apathy: "I feel that students
should take more interest in their
College...that people should take a more
active role in something so important as the
Curriculum Committee."
JessicaMcFarland '9B, appointments chair
for Student Council, strongly disagreed. She
believes students choose not to run because
of a combination ofmany factors—students'
involvement in other activities, potential candidates' fears of putting themselves under
scrutiny, and ignorance of the open position.

She cited the tremendous interest shown for
appointed positions as well as the high attendance at recent Student Council meetings.
"Students here have so many goals, but once
Student Council does more, people will respond better," she said.
Since the postponement of the election,
three students have expressed interest in running for the Committee. The students' intent
to run, however, will not be finalizeduntil the
submission oftheir platforms, which are due
on September 25. If no student chooses to run
for the position, it will remain unfilled until
the next election, scheduled for December.

Campus Beauty Attracts Newlyweds in Trolley

Megan and Larry Bennetta posed for wedding pictures in the Arboretum garden behind McCabe before their wedding last
Saturday. The happy couple had no direct connection to the College, but chose to take photos on campus for its beauty.
The wedding party, resplendent in pink dresses and tuxedos, traveled by trolley for the event. Several of the groomsmen,

Interclub Task Force Finds Space
Administrators aid students
in finding meeting space

after loss ofCRC offices
By

Tara Zahra

After several weeks of negotiation, the
Student Space Task Force successfully procured either Bond or Sharpies 111 for the use
of the student groups which were displaced
by the conversion of the CRC to administrative office space this summer.
The group has also gotten a guarantee of
student representation on a committeewhich
will continue long-range planning for a student center on campus. Dean Ngina Ly thcott
and Associate Dean Tedd Goundie and Student Activities Coordinator Jen Leigh are
still determining which spaces will be made
available to student groups by the beginning
of next semester.
In the immediate future, clubs will have

access to the old Budget Committee office in
the basement ofParrish and the former Karen
Carpenter room on the fifth floor ofParrish.
The Student Space Task Force, composed
of Amy Dalton '9B, Vincent Jones '9B, Kristen
Jones '97, Kristin Sostowski '97, and Fred
Veith '99, is an Interclub committee, representing over 25 student organizations, that
was formed in response to the recent loss of
student space.
According to Vincent Jones '9B, the task
force has been pleased with the
administration's responsiveness so far.
"Things were easy; they have been really
helpful," he said,.citing the administration's
willingness to consider studentproposals such
as allowing student use of Sharpies 111. Amy
Dalton '9B agreed, saying "it has been quite
an affirming experience for me."
On the other hand, the Task Force was less
than pleased with Student Council's cooperation. "Student Council was not listening;
the administration was," said Jones.
A statement issued a week ago by the Task

Force said that although one Councilmember
was supportive, at a Student Council open
meeting the Task Force got the impression
that "some Council members felt that the
Task Force had stepped into SC territory by
approaching the adminstration regarding
space issues."
However, Dalton has hope for the future. "I
think that there is a lot of potential for cooperation between Interclub Committees and
Student Council," she said.
The primary objectives of the Task Force
were not not only to develop a temporary,
medium-range and long-range plan for securing student space, but also to ensure that
some sort of common room was available to
student groups that might wish to work together.
Jones named the Interclub Committee and
the Progressive Action Committee as two
such multi-club organizations. Dalton said
that once the administration understood the
need for such common space, they were eager to cooperate.

Sharples Makes Changes to Cope
New equipment, employees,
procedures initiated to
improve service
By

Toki Rehder

The Sharpies Dining Hall staff made a
number of changes in order to accommodate
the increased number of students enrolled
this year, including purchasing more supplies, hiring new employees, and introducing
new menu items.
In addition to replacing missing supplies,
theDining Hall has also purchased additional
bowls, plates, cups, pots, and silverware, as
well as buying a new hot chocolate machine.
A cart containing bagels and other bread
items now sits by the condiment bar, and such
items as PastaSaladBar and Oriental Chicken
Salad Bar have appeared. According to Linda
McDougal, Director of Dining Services, food
orders are larger this year, but only "by a
small percentage."

Two additional full-time positions have
been added to the Dining Hall staff. These
positions have been filled by Joanna
Dagnozzio, who works in Dessert Prep and
Deli, and Samantha Keough, who works in
Salad Prep. Several new employees were also
hired to replace employees whodid notreturn
this year.
The increased number of students has affected Dining Hall employees to different
degrees. Eric Dennis, a Dining Service employee, stated that things are "basically the
same" this year when compared to last year.
"We get the number of people to expect and
prepare [food] for that amount."
The dish belt is affected the most by the
increased number of students. "It looks like
there are 200 more students this year," said
Wilson Keattes, who works in the dish room.
Brett Day, another Dining Services employee,
agreed: "There's a whole lot more people
than last year. Sometimes we run out of stuff,
but now we have everything together."
In order to improve efficiency on the dish
belt, Sharpies has adopted a new procedure of

asking students to place "tumblers to the left
and silverware to the right" when returning
trays. Donald Holmstrom, Front End Manager, believes this will improve efficiency.
"Because of the way the dish belt is designed
(with a sharp turn at the end), this [procedure]
helps the people in the dish room handle it
when trays are lined up end to end," he

explained.
Students disagree as to whether these
changes have adequately addressed overcrowding in Sharpies. Eric Shamblen '97
says that students are "still piling up in front
of the conveyor belt."
Offering bag lunches and putting in a deli
bar upstairs are two possible solutions to
student overcrowding. Implementing these
ideas, however, would entail additional food
and labor costs which are not in Sharpies'

budget at this time.
The primary problem, according to
McDougal, "is not whether Sharpies can accommodate students, but class schedules
which mean that students all get out of class
at the same time."

"For the second time this week several
book bags were stolen from Sharpies Dining
Hall during the noon meal," wrote Terri
Narkin, administrative assistant for Public
Safety, in the third public safety bulletin
issued this week. Other bulletins described
incidents of theft and indecent exposures on
campus.
On Monday, and again Thursday, six book
bags were either stolen or had items removed
from them in Sharpies. The thefts appear to
have occurred during the lunch rush times of
11:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.
Hillary Thompson '99 was a victim of
backpack theft. "AtSwarthmore, 'valuables'
are measured on a different scale. My French
paper and other books were in there and I
needed those. Material items are secondary
to educational items," said Thompson.
Thompson's bag was recovered in Sharpies
and she only lost three and a half hours of
study time. "From now on, I will find a table
and set my bag down there, but this is Swat.
I love it and I don't want to be paranoid."
The culprit(s) appeared to be mostly interested in cash. In some cases entire backpacks
were stolen; in others, only wallets or cash
were taken from backpacks. Several wallets
were later found outside the dining hall. Two
other thefts from Sharpies have been reported
since the start of the semester.
On Friday, September 13, a nude man was
seen in the women's dressing room at Ware
Pool. In a similar incident, a man entered the
Nautilus room of the Field House and exposed himself to two students. The descriptions of the men were similar: "Caucasian
male, 40-45 [years] old, approximately 6
[feet] tall, heavy set, short, straight light brown
or grayish hair, no facial [hair] or glasses."
As a result of the crimes, "Extra patrols of
these areas were started immediately. Investigative efforts are continuing. Swarthmore

Police have also been alerted and are assisting in our efforts to identify those responsible," said Owen Redgrave, director ofPublic Safety. Said Narkin, "No suspects have
yet been identified, although several leads
are being actively pursued."
Linda McDougal, director of Dining Services, felt that "it is a.setup by someone
outside the campus .These were planned thefts
because they all happened within a certain
time period." Redgrave also believed the
crimes were "premeditated."
McDougal doubted that Dining Services
employees might be responsible for the thefts.
"They all wear bright pink shirts. I think
someone would notice that!" McDougal also
noted that the employees are also potential
victims of theft; they had been told to "keep
theireyes open" for suspicious people, especially those paying cash. Students have been
advised not to leave valuable or personal
property unattended anywhere on campus.
Many students share the opinions expressed
by Cathy Yoon 'OO. "This is a small community and things like this shouldn't happen,"
she said. "Then again, there is no such thing
as acrime-free environment."The thefts seem
to have made an impact on the student population, with an increasing number of students
carrying their bags with them into the dining
rooms at Sharpies. "I am not overly concerned about the thefts," said Yoon. "The
exposure was disgusting and I would have
never expected ithere. Events like the shooting at Penn [Pennsylvania State University
earlier this week] are more disturbing. In both
cases, people are not respecting others."
Redgrave reminded students to let Public
Safety handle potential thieves and flashers:
"If one sees a crime in progress—do not put
oneself in jeopardy, call Public Safety immediately at extension 8333. Any other information concerning a crime should be reported to Public Safety at extension 8281 or
in person at the Benjamin West House."

Senior Slates Compete
By

Kate

Doty

Two large slates of candidates are competing for the privilege of serving as senior class
officers.As seniorclass officers, thoseelected
will be in charge of activities for the Class of
'97, both in their senior year at Swarthmore
and as alumni. The officers run Senior Week,
the week before graduation; coordinate
fundraising efforts; and organize variousother
social events for seniors.
Because the officers are elected as an already formed group, they can determine which
members perform duties such as class agent,
class correspondent, and vice president after
the election. However, one candidate group
is running on the platform that it will "work
by consensus and shareresponsibility," rather
than divide up the duties in the traditional
manner.
Jonah Steinberg '97, a member of that
particular group of nine candidates, believes
the nontraditionalformatis conducive to "representing the diversity of interests in the
things that students do here." He continued,
"Both [groups of officers] would do a good
job. There would just probably be a difference in the actual activities that get done."
Becca Neff '97, a member of the other

candidate group, feels that having class officers assume responsibility for separate dutieswill make the process "more fluid." "It's a
good idea if it [the council form] works. But
there can be difficulties with a situation like
that." This particular officer group is more or
less an "amalgamation of people justcoming
together for a particular reason" rather than
one which is connected in other areas of
campus life, said Neff. "We found a lot of
people who were interested...the more working together the better."
Steinberg, Jenni Anderson, Kristen
Osborne, AnnikaStroope,Laura Kozek, Mike
Pan, John Todd, Omar Mencin, and Jeremy
Weinstein hope to "leave Swarthmore with
something that represents our class as a community, our fearlessness to take on the world,
and our commitment to each other," according to their platform.
Neff, Vito Agnesi, Brenda Arellano, Wendy
Cadge, Tony Cheesebrough, Catherine
Chomat, Jodi Furr, Jon Githens-Mazer,
Duleesha Kulasooriya, David Lischer, and
Amber Thompson aim to form, in Neff s
words, "a cohesive unit that we like and want
to keep in touch with."
The voting period started yesterday and
will conclude on Monday.

Paces Improves Menu and Service
The coordinators of Paces have instituted some improvements,
including additions to the menu and a new service position.which
first appeared when the popular student-run cafe" opened Sunday.
Paces co-coordinators Dana Correale '97 and Andrea Barnett '97
have added a new service position called Bar Back, whose job is to
aid servers by running drinks and busing tables as well as providing
general help. "People have said the service is much better and
hopefully there won't be as long lines," Correale said.
Correale and Barnett have also added a new section of the menu
called "Light Fare." Every week there will be a different soup or
salad from which customers may choose. This week's menu featured
gazpacho. Yogurt-fruit smoothies have also been added to the bar
menu.

In general, customers should notice slight differences in the
rotating menu items. Correale and Barnett have hired two new cooks
who will bring some new recipes to the coffeehouse.
Correale and Barnett have also overseen the installation of a new
dishwasher, stove and freezer. The freezer will allow Paces staff to
store more ice cream and frozen yogurt by the bar so that the bar staff
can make more frozen drinks, said Correale.
For the upcoming semester Correale and Barnett are considering
having a mural contest for another wall in Paces. They also plan to
have more theme nights and to have entertainment twice a week.
According to Correale, no changes have been made to Pub Nite,
which will continue to appear every Thursday night.

Bi-Co News Takes Potshot at Swarthmore
In a graphic Tuesday reporting the 1997 national liberal arts
college rankings published in U.S. News & World Report, The Bryn
Mawr andHaverford Bi-CollegeNews quoted an unnamed Haverford
administrator as saying that Swarthmore's ranking "just proves how
meaningless it is." In the annual rankings, Swarthmore placed first,
Haverford sixth, and Bryn Mawr eleventh in the same category.

Student Council Feeds Willets
Members ofStudent Council sponsored an all-Willets study break
Wednesday in order to familiarize new students with the role of
Student Council and to gauge students' opinions on College affairs.
Over pizza and Pepsi, SC members answered questions and
listened to concerns aired by the mostly first-year crowd. Issues
discussed ran the gamut from student parking and financial aid to
whether we should have a student center.
SC plans to throw similar study breaks in other dorms throughout
the year. SC member Alyssa Ray man-Read '99 said, "The primary
goal of going to dorms is getting to know the students that we
represent."

Shooting at Penn State
Charges have been filed against 19-year-old Jillian Robbins, the
suspect in a shooting incident on Penn State University's Park
Campus on Tuesday. The shooting claimed the life of 21-year-old
Melanie Spalla and wounded Nicholas Mensah. A third shot ripped
through the backpack of another witness. A total of five shots were
fired in the incident.
The shooting is reminiscent of an incident at San Diego State
University over the summer, where a master's degree candidate shot
three professors who were reviewing his thesis defense.

Outside Funding Makes Common Sense
Conservative funding
supports "other"
voice at Swarthmore
By Andy Murray

It is often the case that students are
drawn to a college like Swarthmore
because of the diversity it promises
and encourages. Itis seen as a strength
that a liberal arts education offers
exposure to a wide range of ideologies and perspectives. This sense of
acceptance, however, does little to
conceal the fact that an education at
Swarthmore, more often than not,
has a liberal leaning.
Eager to influence what they see as
the next generation of policy-makers, politically conservative foundationshave begun investing in conservative programs on college campuses.

A large portion of this funding has
gone to establish a national network
of student-run conservative newspapers, which includes Swarthmore's
Common Sense.
Founded in 1953 by William F.
Buckley, the Intercollegiate Studies
Institute (ISI) works, in its own words,

on [college] campuses."
Today, ISI maintains a network of
55 college papers. Swarthmore's conservative paper, Common Sense, is
included in this network and receives
support in the form of funding and
information from ISI. "Most college
campuses have a 'Liberal Orthodoxy,'" maintains Chris Long, the
Vice-President of ISl's Collegiate
Network. ISl's goal is to support student-run newspapers that present an
"alternative to this orthodoxy."
In addition to the funding ISI brings
to these organizations, many papers
receive information and training
through the network. Student writers
and editors can attend ISI conferences where they are able to listen to
and meet with national figures and

speakers; editors and staff for Com-

mon Sense have attended national
conferences in Washington D.C. and

Seattle.
The conferences are also opportunities for students working for different conservative papers to share their
ideas and opinions amongst themselves and with the network's staff.
Neena Shenai '99, co-editor of Common Sense, acknowledged that the

New Campus Patrol
By

Lauren Rackow

The College's Public Safety Department has restructured the Garnet
Patrol to increase its efficiency. During the past two years, the Garnet
Patrol assisted the Public Safety officers by increasing the frequency of
patrols around campus.
Three semesters ago, Margaret
Gold '95 and other students developed the Garnet Patrol to reduce the
frequency of criminal acts on campus
and provide more student employment. Originally, the Garnet Patrol
consisted of shifts of students patrolling campus in pairs, who carried
hand radios to report suspicious activity to the Public Safety Department. Lieutenant George Iredale considers the Garnet Patrol "an additional set of eyes and ears."
In previous years, many students
did not fulfill their Garnet Patrol responsibilities. "Last year, some students did not report to their shifts.
Jobs went unattended," Iredale said.
Instead of patrolling the area, some
Garnet Patrollers socialized with
friends while on duty. Elijah Porter
'99 believes that the Garnet Patrol
"made my safe walk shift more interesting. I talked with the patrollers on
my two-way radio and often stopped
by to hang out with them."
This year, instead of patrolling in
pairs, students will patrol alone. In
addition, the Garnet Patrol shuttles
will play a greater role in deterring
crime at Swarthmore. Yolanda Rosi
'97, the director of the shuttle system
at Swarthmore, defined the new role
of these shuttles: "In the past, the
vans were separate from the Garnet

Patrol, the new shuttle will have a
patrolling element."
While many members of the Garnet Patrol believe this new system

will prevent the patrollers from so-

cializing while on duty, many students believe that this system puts the
patrollers at risk. Jennifer Briggs '99
explained, "One patroller is not a safe
idea, especially with women. I do not
feel comfortable walking alone at
night, and I doubt any patroller would
feel comfortable."
Other students do not believe that
one student patrolling an area of campus adequately protects Swarthmore
students. Liz Ryan 'OO stated, "I do
not see how a Garnet Patroller is
more safe than arandom studentwalking around." Briggs concurred, citing that one student is not "terribly
daunting to a criminal." Despite the
danger, Rebecca Brodie 'OO, a future

patroller, is "not worried about patrolling the campus alone."
Many students do not believe the
Garnet Patrol is useful at all. A member of the class of 'OO asserts, "The
Garnet Patrol does not have much to
do. Swarthmore is a very safe community, and the area surrounding
Swarthmore is very safe. Since Swarthmore does not have a great risk for
illegal activity, the Garnet Patrol is

superfluous."

Despite the problems with the Gar-

net Patrol, the program provides con-

siderable comfort for some students.
Julie Russo 'OO said, "The Patrol
makes me feel safe. I am glad that
some students are looking for dangerous situations. It's great that these
students wantto make Swarthmore a

paper does receive a portion of its
funding from ISI, but declined to say
how much. In addition, ISI provides
the paper with research information.
Support for conservative newspapers has infuriated and frightened
some liberal onlookers. The Center
for Campus Organizing, estimates
that conservative foundations spend
roughly $2O million annually in programs to promote conservatism on
college campuses. In response, the
organization has developed a "Guide
to Uncovering the Right on Campus." Published on the World Wide
Web, the guide has become apart of
the growing liberal reaction to foundations' support for collegiate conservatism.

Other organizations, like People
for the American Way, and students
who oppose groups like ISI have also
turned to the Net to publicize the
amount being spent to promote college conservatism.
However, while liberal campus
newspapers do not appear to receive
funding of an equal or similar nature,
they often find support in different
ways. At Swarthmore, The Phoenix,
which has moved through both liberal and conservative periods, re-

Election '96

ceives part of its funding from the
student Budget Committee. Common Sense, in contrast, does not.
According to Budget Committee
Treasurer TanishaLittle '97, "they've
never applied." Little added that she
couldn't see any reason why the committee would withhold funding from
Common Sense, saying she "knew of
no organization that has been totally

denied funding from us [BC]."
With help from ISI, Common Sense
has established a conservative student voice at Swarthmore for the last
five years.
"I don't agree with most of the
things they say in their articles,"
Solimar Salas '9B said, "But I can
respect their right to their own opinion. What do you expect at Swat?
Everybody has something to say."
Shenai says that the goal for Common Sense has always been to add to
the educationavailable at Swarthmore
by bringing into discussion "both
sides ofthe issues." In this, the paper's
success is measurable both in the
praise and the criticism it has received. "We always get a response,"
admitted Shenai, "both positive and
negative, but we always get a re-

sponse."

Sharpies Cooks
More Than Food
By

Jessica Roney

The intense heat in Sharpies isa
problem that every student and
every Dining Services employee
has recently had to contend with,
and it is taking its toll.
Last week's cooler weather
brought a slight respite from the
heat, but it is still an issue for the
workers as well as a discomfort
for the students. Linda McDougal,
director of Dining Services, says
that some of the workers have
experienced health problems due
to the heat.
It is not so much a problem for
those who work in the kitchen,
where there is a good cooling and
circulation system, but it's difficult for the staff who have to work

behind the counters.
Since fans would be a health
hazard, workers behind the food
counters must suffer from particularly intense high temperatures.
Margaret Lindsey, one of the
counter workers, said that staff
members are "wet dishrags" by
the end of the day.
Large fans have been put in the
dining areas to help circulate air,
but they are more efficient at bio wing napkins and cups off of trays,
and according to McDougal, do
almost no good "except to make a
lot of noise."

McDougal has requested that

since students use Sharpies mostly
during the cooler months, keeping
the facility cool has not been a
high priority. "I wish I could do
something about it, but I can't,"
she says. "It has to come from the
students."
Instead of taking action to improve air circulation that would
cool the building, the College has
made changes to Sharpies in recent years that have made the situ-

ation even worse.
Sharpies was designed to circulateair like a chimney. Originally,
air was directed towards the center of the building and left through
the windows above the "central
lounge area" where today the condiments bar stands.
Although this design won an
architectural award when Sharpies
was first designed, recent changes
have exacerbated the heat problem. Three yearsago the windows
above the condiments bar were
taken out and new stained glass
windows, which cannot be opened,
were installed. Moreover, there is
currently no viable way to get the
air to circulate properly. Not only
does the air have no place to go, it
doesn't move in the first place.

Black people continue to be overrepresented among the poor, unemployed, underemployed, underskilled, and incarcerated populations.
Today, as in the past, many people
argue that these problems exist due to
genetic, social and/ormoral deficiencies of Black people. Ironically, several prominent Black persons espouse
the rhetoric of their conservative cronies despite the research of scholars
of varying hues, numerous documentaries, court cases, etc., that have exposed the racial biases which exist in

Solutions to Car Crisis

Circulation Manager

By

Student apathy is disgraceful.
You still have time to declare your candidacy for the vacant student seat on
Swarthmore's Curriculum Committee. That's right, the deadline to submit
platforms has been extended until midnight Saturday, in response to popular
demand of a very bizarre sort—as far as we know, no one has come forward
with a platform even though Student Council has been soliciting candidacies
for nearly two weeks.
The student body's utter apathy regarding this election can only be
described as embarrassing. After last spring's dramatic efforts—including
the first sit-in ever at a meeting of the Board of Managers—to win more
student influence in College decisions, we're astonished that not one of the
1437 students enrolled this semester is willing to run for a seat on one of
Swarthmore's most important administrative bodies.
We'd run for Curriculum Committee ourselves, if we weren't busy enough
putting out a newspaper each week. Other students probably have similar
excuses: if it weren't for a seminar, or a leadership role in some activity, or
a campus job, or a sport, they'd run, too.
But last spring students somehow found time to protest at the Board
meeting, to pack informational meetings in Parrish Parlors, and to have angry
conversations with administrators. The issue that precipitated the protests
was an increase in loan and work requirements for students on financial aid
and since the protests didn't convince the College to roll back that increase,
they won't have accomplished anything at all unless students make the most
of the one concession the College did offer, increased representation on
committees.
Students complain all the time that the administration here doesn't try hard
enough to involve them in major decisions. We're often inclined to agree. But
this time around, we can see why the College sometimes doesn't bother
seeking student input. If not one student cares enough about Swarthmore to
run for Curriculum Committee, why should administrators think students
truly want a bigger role in the institution's governance? We find it hard to
blame the powers-that-be for occasionally suspecting that when students yell
and scream about wanting increased representation, all they really want is the
chance to yell and scream.
—

after all.

For as long as anyone can remember, students have left their bookbags
hanging on coatracks and piled by the fireplace while they eat in Sharpies
Dining Hall.
No longer.
After two separate incidents this week in which several bookbags and other
belongings were stolen from Sharpies while their owners dined, students are
leaving bags at home or taking them to their tables while they eat. Only three
bags lay on the downstairs hearth, traditionally blanketed with dozens of
knapsacks, at dinner Thursday night.
No one knows who took the bags—it couldhave been a student, ora College
employee, or someone from off-campus—but regardless of who's responsible, the thefts have made Swarthmore a colder place.
This is—or was, we should perhaps say—a trusting campus. Many students
leave their rooms unlocked, even when they're asleep or away for trie day. No
one's stationed at the door ofCornell Library to keep you from walking away
with a book youhaven't checked out. It's easy to steal food from the snackbar
in Tarble; the management just trusts that no one will do it. And, of course,
students leave bikes unlocked even if there are racks nearby, and books on
tables in the library when they run to Sharpies for a quick meal, and bags on
the ground while they eat.
Swarthmore is not the isolated, secure place many people still tend to think
it is. In the spring of 1994, there was a rash of computer thefts. That fall, there
were two muggings late at night on poorly-lit paths. Last spring, a thiefrifled
through bookbags left in McCabe Library. Just last Friday, an unknown man
exposed himself in the women's dressing room of Ware Pool and in the
Nautilus room ofLamb-Miller Field House.
But the bookbag thefts have reminded us, in a way few of these previous
crimes did, that we can no longer be so trusting. It's sad that this happened,
that someone felt the need to steal another person's belongings—because they
were hungry and neededmoney for food, or because they just wanted the thrill
of stealing, or for some other reason about which we can only speculate. And
it's sad that we must now wonder if the people we see around us—whether
they are affiliated with the College or not—are potential flashers, thieves, or

worse.
But wonder we must. Please, folks, hold on to your bags, chain your bikes
to the racks, and above all, lock your doors. Because otherwise, the next public

safety bulletin in your e-mail may be about something far more tragic than the
theft of a bookbag.

Pay attention to the wide, wide world.
On Saturday, Bosnia held its first elections after nearly four years of war.
The United States sent 5,000 soldiers to Kuwait this week in response to Iraqi
attacks on Kurdish settlements and on American warplanes policing the "nofly" zone in northern Iraq. Former Vice President Spiro Agnew, whoresigned
in disgrace in 1973, died Tuesday of leukemia. Presidential candidate Bob
Dole fell off a stage Wednesday at a campaign rally in Chico, California. The
House of Representatives voted Thursday to override President Bill Clinton's
veto of the partial birth abortion ban; the Senate hasn't taken up the issue yet.
We' dlike to believe all our readers already knew about these events, but we
suspect that isn't the case. Sadly, people at Swarthmore sometimes lose track
of what's going on in the world out there—even though happenings on
campus are usually quite inconsequential in the larger scheme of things.

In the weeks that come, we' re going to make a greater effort to help you stay
on top ofnational and world news. But you have to do your part, too. It won't
do any good for us to print news from the "real world" unless you read it. And
you should, because there is life beyond College Avenue.

Morality Calls for Care
By

Andrew T. Bryce

Last week there appeared in The
Phoenix an article proclaiming that
health care is not a basic right of the
people. It said that no one is responsible for other people. It said that
people are not entitled to health care.
There is not any more basic right
than health care! What more basic
right do we have than to live? Among
wolves, sick and dying members of a
pack are leftfor the good ofthe group.
If you want to compare human society with a pack of wolves, then you
are entitled. I, however, believe that
we have risen above the basic atavistic selfishness of wild animals. Show
me why ailing members of our pack
who cannot find aid for themselves
should be discarded. Can you do it?
Can you come up with any good
reasons why the right to liveis not the
most basic right a human being has?
I can't. If you can, then I salute you.
You are a better person than I.
What does this mean to us? This
means that we, as humans, and as
members of a compassionate, loving
species, see to it that children who
sieep on the street do not die of pneumonia, and that a man lying alone in
his two room apartment does not die
of cancer, and to see to it that a poor
motherdoes not bend over thebroken
body of her child because she could
not pay for medication for his epilepsy. It does not mean that we give
our lives up for these people. But I
certainly do not think they should
give up their lives for us.
Let me present a typical conversation I might have on this topic. Me:
People need health care. "Yes, but
they also need haircuts, too." Me: Let
me give you a hypothetical situation.
You have lung cancer, and you have
long hair. I ask you if you want to go
to the hospital or the barber. What
would you say? "Well, the hospital,

but..." Me: Or, we could give you
chemotherapy and kill two birds with
one stone. "That's not funny." Me:
Neitheris this article. I am being dead
serious, so please don't distract the
subject ofhuman life with the frivolities ofhaircuts. How can you even try
to compare them? "My only point
was that if we try to account for
everything that people might need,
then we would have way to much to
think about and we would have to
give everything we own in taxes."
Me: So let's kill everyone who needs
something. Then we would be in a
much better situation. "Wejustmight,
you never know..."
We are blessed, Swarthmore. We
have what others can only dream
about. This is not conceit, it is the
truth. We have food and money. We
have a place to live. We have a family. We are going to the best college
in the COUNTRY, for God's sake.
Look down.Look in the gutter. There
are the people we need to help. There
are people who die because they are
not provided for. I am not asking you
to give up everything you have for
these people. I am asking you to share
some of your blessing with them.
That's all. Take what you have, all
the marvelous opportunities, and all
the security, and let someone live
instead of letting them die. How can
we let anyone die?
Conceive of what it is like to be
these people, Swarthmore. Conceive
of what it is like to wake up every day
on a park bench, or in a two room
apartment with a five person family.
Conceive of what it is like to have
debt, death, and poverty loom over
you with every second of each passing day. These are people. They think,
like you and me. They feel, like you
and me. They do not live like you and
me. Always remember to look down!
There is someone there who needs
your help!

nearly every major institution which
forms the foundation of this great
country of ours. For instance, hundreds of arrests and convictions have
been repealed in Philadelphia due to
blatant police wrongdoing. Several
Black persons in New Jersey have
complained of being harassed when
attempting to register to vote. Both
major political parties lack true diversity among their leadership and
convention delegates. And schools in
predominantly Black neighborhoods
receive substantially less funding than
those attended by white children.
In the glory days of the Civil Rights
and Black Power movements, Black
people, white liberals and compassionateindividuals ofany background
did not buy into the rhetoric of the
New Right and other extremists. Instead, they cited racism, discrimination and structural inequality as the
cause for a great deal of the problems
in Black America. Moreover, they
organized and did something to right
these wrongs. In contemporary times,
many so-called activists and intellectuals theorize in their secluded homes
or between the covers of a best selling book rather than engage in constructive action.
At the same time, the radical right,
the Republican party and others do
all they can to bring the country back
to the bad old days when women
could not vote andBlack people were
slaves.
Although much of the blatant racism and discrimination of the Jim
Crow and Slavery eras no longer occurs, contemporary Black people
must contend with a new strain of
racism, which tends to be more subtle,
hidden and largely structural. Before,
the signs designating which fountains were reserved for "Coloreds"
and "Whites" made it relatively easy
to identify racism.
Today, one must research the implications and effects of seemingly
beneficial efforts such as the "War on
Drugs" (which should be renamed a
"A War on Blacks and Latinos" since

it is primarily fought in areas with
large numbers of these groups).
As a result, the levels of activism
amongBlack young people and other
sympathetic groups have drastically
declined since the twilight of theCivil
Rights and Black Power movements
due to the difficulty of battling an
enemy not easily identified. Instead
of organizing, protesting and demonstrating against the efforts of several
groups to weaken, undereducate,
criminalize and otherwise marginalize Black people, young AfricanAmericans and others busy themselves with other things, some of
which are productive and others of
which only produce negative effects.
If Black youth and those people
committed to promoting justice and
equality do not begin to understand
and organize against the new face of
racism, Black people will continue to
be second-class citizens and experience great difficulty in obtaining the
so-called American dream. Black
young people constitute a huge portion of the African-American community and have the potential of effecting significant positive growth
for people of African descent in this
country, especially with the support
of carefully chosen allies.
However, in order to realize that
potential, young African-Americans
must train themselves in the ways of
political and community organizing,
economic development and group
politics. Although the end result of a
new movement fomented by Black
young people with the support of
those concerned individuals would
be a great thing and is desperately
needed, it will not be easy and will
involve a great deal of hard work.
However, it can be done. If you don't
believe that, justask your parents and
grandparents. Many of them sacrificed greatly so that all of us, regardless of race, ethnicity, or any other
identity, could enjoy greater access
to the stability and opportunities
promised by being an American citizen in more than name only.

Dole's Criminal Idiocy
By

Brendan

Nyhan

A Rand Corporation study com-

pared the three strikes law, a
Bob Dole's crime and drug proposals, unveiled Monday at a raliy at
Villanova University, are not only
bad public policy, but reveal the extent of his hypocrisy.
Dole promised to halve youth drug
use and double federal spending for
state prisons. Also, he pledged to
abolish parole for violent criminals

and use the National Guard to stop
the entry of illegal drugs into the U.S.
Dole laid the blame for the nation's
drug and crime problems on the liberal Clinton administration.
His drug proposals are plainly
hypocritical. Dole, who has opposed
F.D.A. regulation of tobacco, said he
would tell the youth of America that
"[d]rugs are deadly" and called the
Clinton administration soft on drugs.
What Dole somehow fails to mention is that tobacco kills more than
400,000 people each year in the U.S.,
more than AIDS, murder, suicide,
alcohol, illegal drugs, car accidents,
and fires combined.
Dole's well-documented sympathies towards the tobacco industry
are no doubt unrelated to the nearly
$500,000 in tobacco money he has
accepted over the course of his career. Since Clinton is vulnerable on
the issue of illegal drugs, Dole has
attacked. Dole is paid to allow you to
kill yourself with tobacco, but not
with illegal drugs.
Posting the National Guard on the
border is a ridiculous proposal. Far
more effective (and cheaper) would
be to work in schools and the community on prevention and treatment,
but that isn't as politically appealing.
Further, this would reduce drug-relatedcrime by decreasing usage more
than any military measures.
Although President Clinton is also
a proponent of reducing the flow of
drugs into America, he has proposed
treatmentplansaswell. Forexample,
Clinton announced that he will only
give federal aid for building state
prisons if each state has treatment
and prevention programs in place for
prisoners and parolees (statistics show
that people on bail, parole or probation account for 60% of all cocaine
and heroin purchased).
As far as crime goes, Dole is attacking the symptoms ofurban decay
rather than the cause. Crime is rooted
in the vicious cycle of broken families, little economic opportunity, and
few jobs. Extreme punishments will
not detercrime. An example ofDole's
short-sighted priorities are his promises to restore the Office of National
Drug Control Policy and to eliminate
the Department of Education.

draconian measure similar in intent
to some ofDole's proposals in terms

ofits goal ofpreventing crime through
increased punishments. The authors
concluded that cash graduation incentives were more than three times
as effective in terms of dollars spent
per serious crime averted than the
three strikes law, and parent training
was more than twice as effective. A
reasonable conclusion is that prevention is most likely more costeffective than long-term incarceration of the kind Dole proposes.
In all fairness, President Clinton
supports three strikes and other such
measures, but he also clearly backs
increased efforts in prevention (an
example is Head Start). Prison spending is threatening to explode as the
nation locks upits underclass in everincreasing numbers without offering
any help.
Finally, Dole proposed an alternative to the five day waiting period of
the Clinton-backed Brady Bill, proposing an instant check for criminal
backgrounds when buying guns.
There are few reasons that any one
could not wait fi ve'day s to buy a gun,
other than they are planning to shoot
someone. Here Dole is shamelessly
kowtowing to the National Rifle Association, to whom he already promised a repeal of the assault weapons
ban. Once again, the proposals of
Bob Dole are revealed as hypocritical. In this case, he wants to reduce
crime yet is fighting for increased
access to weaponry.
Dole has managed to propose a
series of astronomically expensive
measures which would do little to
curb crime and drug use at a time
when Dole is already pressed to balance the budget under his proposed
tax cut.

Despite Clinton's shortcomings
and similarities to Dole, he is the
superior candidate morally. His proposals to regulate tobacco advertising and sales to minors are courageous, fighting one ofAmerica's oldest and most powerful industries in
order to
Additionally,
Clinton supports more of the prevention programs, like those cited in the
Rand study, which will reduce crime.
Not surprisingly, Clinton has already
garnered the endorsements of police
organizations representing 70% of
officers in the country. Had the election been held on Tuesday, Clinton
would have won the Electoral College 425-110, according to the most
recent polls, and fittingly so. He
shouldbe the next president, for these
reasons among many.

That's what we overheard as we left

J—9 theList Gallery. A man had been walk-

ing around the gallery for 10 minutes in
silence, gazing at Brian Meunier's sculpture,
and had evidently come to this conclusion
based on what he saw.
Actually, it's doubtful that Meunier, professor of studio arts, would resent this assertion. "Art is very manic," he admitted when
we spoke to him in his high-ceilinged office
in Beardsley. "Full Moon," one of four
Meuniers in the faculty art show currently in
the List Gallery, he said, is "about lunacy."
If Brian Meunier is mad, however, he is
mad with creative ideas. These ideas come
bursting out as he talks, connecting to each
other in an intricate web. The list thatMeunier
compiled of his influences, which he himself
describes as "absurd," reveals the mind-boggling variety of inspirations that converge on
his artistic sensibilities.
"I am conscious of the following sources:
Gardner, Massachusetts, 'Chair City of the
World,' the various jobs I have had in furniture factories, 'nautical implements, boats,
wharves, shacks, lobster buoys, knots, traps,
weapons, armor, early musical instruments,
tropical and desert plants, fruits and vegetables, agricultural implements, tools, marine life, fossils, birds, Victorian machines
and inventions, early deep-sea diving devices, Brueghel, Bosch, Audubon, and Beuys,
ancient ceramics, Etruscan jewelry, Eskimo
and North-Coast Indian art, folk music, and
French-Canadian myths of origin."
In the world, Meunier asserts, there are
"three categories of objects: nature, functional forms, and art," with art imitating the
other two. The relationship between artistic
forms and their natural or functional models
is a recurrent theme in his art and life. He
describes his outlook as standing with "one
foot in art, and one foot outside art," and is
fascinated with the boundary between the
functional and the functionless, abstract, ar-

tistic.

REM Takes Off in New Adventures
By

lan Brickk

REM's

New Adventures in Hi-Fi isn't
quite up to the brash claims of its title.
Instead of a departure into the great
unknown, Adventures is a consolidation of
ground already taken, a summation of the
band's 15-year evolution from cryptic college-rock icon to million-selling chart-topper (from Murmur io Monster). At times, the
new album plays like a kind of status report,
one last look at the story so far. The song titles
certainly suggest some sort of resolution:
"How the West Was Won and Where It Got
Us," "Leave," "Departure."
"The story is a sad one, told many times/
the story ofmy life and trying times," Michael
Stipe sings on "How the West was Won," and
it sounds like he's adding up the debits and
dividends, fifteen years in.
So Adventures isn't the landmark, radically new album that Document and Automatic for the People were. It's still, in all
likelihood, one of the best albums of the year.
REM, keeping it safe and simple, does things
that most bands couldn't pull of in their

wildest dreams. An understated semi-folk
waltz like Adventures' "New Test Leper"
might sound trite and precious in any other
context. As executed by Stipe and company it
picks up a sad, lovely emotional punch, rendering it a worthy sequel to Automatic's sublime "Try Not to Breathe."
Powered by a wailing siren and a crunchy,
revolving guitar riff, "Leave" sounds disconcertingly like Live playing way out of their
league. Then you remember that Ed
Kowalczyk is aping Michael Stipe, not the
other way round. The mournful "Undertow"
takes overly-familiar images of water and
birds, heaven and escape, and convinces you
that you've never heard them before.
And the first single, "E-bow the Letter,"
ranks with "Man in the Moon" and "It's the
End of the World As We Know It (andI Feel
Fine)" in sheer chutzpah (as well as in quantum verbiage). Repeating the pop-culture
stream ofconsciousness that worked so well
on those earlier songs, Stipe sings/speaks
over an eerily melancholy semi-acoustic
throb, his nostalgic remembrances punctuated by Patti Smith's bey ond-the-grave

moan.

The grain of Stipe's voice as he sings the
words "tinfoil tiaras" is almost impossibly
right.
The first six songs on Adventures "How
the West Was Won" through "Leave"—rank
with REM's best. The remaining eight feel
more routine. It's in the last third ofthe album
that Adventures' live origins (most of the
songs were recorded during soundchecks or
concert performances on the Monster tour)
come to the fore. With a few exceptions,
these songs feel like outtakes from Monster lots of crunchy guitar, big riffs and not
too much substance. "Binky the Doormat"
and "Low Desert" sound like REM going
through the motions.
The last half of the album isn'tbad, by any
means. It just doesn't have the transcendent
oomph of the first half. But for a 15-year-old
band to be making music that's this good
(even at its worst), is nothing short ofmiraculous. I'd put up with two hours of filler to get
just one of those first songs. Michael Stipe
ends the last song on Adventures,
"Electrolite," singing a cappella: "I'm outta
here." I certainly hope not.

Dive Into The Abyss
By

This

Fred Bush

week's SWIL movie, The Abyss, is a technical and
artistic tour de force, with fabulous underwaterfootage

and gripping action easily carrying the film through its
two hours plus running time. Director James Cameron, of
Terminator and Alien fame, once again shows why he is the
United States' premier director of flashy science fiction.
In The Abyss, Cameron takes viewers deep into the sea,
where a U.S. nuclear submarine has had a strange encounter
and been disabled. Navy SEALS are dispatched to rescue the
crew and cargo of the submarine and investigate possible
Russian involvement in the sub's disabling. As veterans of
the underwater environment, the crew of an underwater
drillingrig are pressed into their country's service to assist in
the rescue and salvage work.
The movie focuses on the discoveries and tribulations of
the crew, whose work is complicated by interpersonal
squabbles between the head of the miners, played by Ed
Harris, and his estranged wife, played by Mary-Elizabeth
Mastrantonio. Now, in many underwater movies, "focus"
would be too strong a word, since it's blurry and difficult to
shoot underwater footage. Not so in The Abyss; this film
developed its own underwater cameras and diving masks, so
that you can make out faces and facial expressions clearly,
even in dark water. The film also exploits the cutting edge of
the possible in diving technology: from computer linkups to
liquid breathing techniques, it takes you to the edge of
reality...but stays there, the viewer's disbelief delightfully
suspended.
The film does a masterful job of creating an alien environment; the deep sea has never been weirder or scarier. Gradually, piece by piece the drillers and SEALS are cut off from
the outside environment, their every link to the world above
severed. The characters, exposed to pressures both outside
and in, clash and tussle; they are finely-drawn and sympathetic, the result of the retooling of the movie's script by sci
fi master Orson Scott Card, who worked closely with the
actors and Cameron while filming.
The Abyss will be shown at 10:00 p.m. on Monday, September 23 in Kirby Lecture Hall. All are welcome, and admission
is free.

On-Campus Movies

Sense Carries You Away;
Sneakers an Enjoyable Hit
By Emily

Shartin

Just

in case this year's hot movie trend
(read: Jane Austen-mania) passed you
by, allow me briefly to fill you in: during
the past year we have been blessed with
British Broadcasting Corportation(BBC) productions of both Persuasion and Pride and
Prejudice, Clueless (Amy Heckerling's pastiche of the Austen classic Emma), and currently a straight-up film version of Emma
starring Gwyneth Paltrow.
But the film that most people would probably point to as the figurehead of the recent
Austen fixation is director Ang Lee's Sense
and Sensibility, which plays on campus this
weekend.
Adapted for the screen by the Oscar-winning British actress/writer Emma Thompson,
the film also stars Thompson in the role of
Eleanor Dashwood, a prim, good-natured
"spinster," who sits on the "sensibility" side
of Austen's fence. She is contrasted to her
sensual younger sister Maryanne (Kate
Winslet), who is forever quoting
Shakespeare's sonnets, trying to challenge
the all-too-proper system, and looking for
romance until it makes her ill.
The melodrama that unfolds in each
woman's search for happiness in Sense is
indeed predictable, but still enjoyable to
watch. Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant, and Hugh
Laurie all do outstanding jobs in their supporting roles as sympathetic men who are in
one way or another caught up in the Dashwood

family affairs.
The English countryside plays a similarly
important supporting role. If nothing else, it
is remarkably lovely, and manages to convince you that nothing terrible could ever
happen in such beautiful surroundings. Despite occasional emotional hardship, you
know from the onset that there is a happy
ending in store for Eleanor and Maryanne.
But underneath the loveliness, a good deal
of satire and societal criticism characterize
Jane Austen's novels, and Sense is no exception. Issues of class, gender relations and
categorizations, and sexuality all intersect at
various points in the story, raising questions
about the Dashwoods' position as uppermiddle-class women in English society. Moreover, the community is so uptight it relies
almost entirely on gossip in order for one
person to let another know what s/he is feel-

ing. It uses the device to such a maddeningly
silly extent in the story that it's evident that
Austen herself had plenty to say about the alltoo-proper system.
Nonetheless, SenseandSensibility remains
one of those movies you can allow yourself to
be carried away by. Smart women, beautiful
scenery, Hugh Grant, and the happy ending
all rolled into one critically engineered, not to
mention acclaimed film. It plays Friday in the
PAC Cinema at 7:30 and 10 p.m.
I have yet to meet the person who does not
find Phil Alden Robinson's Sneakers enjoyable. Set in modern-day San Francisco, the
film stars Robert Redford as Martin Bishop,
a hacker on the run from the Feds for breaking
into the wrong systems when he was an
undergrad. He since has formed a loyal band
of "sneakers" (played by Dan Aykroyd,
Sydney Poitier, and River Phoenix), who
make their living testing various companies'
security systems; as one character puts it,
they are hired to break into places to make
sure that no one can break into places.
Things are going swimmingly for the sneakers until Dick, a sleazy middlemanplayed by
Timothy Busfield, whoclaims to work for the
National Security Agency, presents them with
what turns out to be their riskiest sneak to
date. The guys end up uncovering a little too
much information, and put themselves in
tremendous danger until they can figure out
what's going on and whom they can trust.
It is certainly fun to watch them figure
things out. The movie is filled with all kinds
of deceptive operations and ploys carried out
by the sneakers so that they can get the
information they need. And aside from the

sneakers themselves, the film also boasts
nifty performances by Mary McDonnell and
Ben Kingsley, not to mention an incredible
driving scene.

Refreshingly, Sneakers is not out primarily
claims about the state of world
affairs. It does bring up some relevant points
to make any

concerning global powerand electronic safety,
but ultimately these serve only to provide
background information for what is simply
an interesting and very enjoyable story to
watch. It's true that there are a few minor
gaps in the plot every now and then, butallow
yourself the suspension ofdisbeliefandSneakers will be one of the more entertaining films
you've seen in a while. It plays Saturday in
the PAC Cinema at 7:30 and 10 p.m.

Uncovers

Much More Than 20 Years of Student Activism

Elizabeth Weber

In

celebration of its 20th anniversary,
Mother Jones magazine has been making
lists of 20 things. Swarthmore was included on this month's list—the top 20 activist campuses of the past 20 years, in alphabetical order. The magazine cited Swarthmore's
past involvement with housing rehabilitation
and its current environmental involvement
with Chester residents. But student activists

always wanted to be an investigative reporter. Actually, that's not true.
I've really always wanted to be an astronaut. I've also always wanted to be five foot
ten with long flaxen hair and tiny feet with
itsy-bitsy pink toenails and with a voice like
a song bird at the breaking of the dawn after
a summer's...never mind. For the sake of this
article, I' ve always wanted to be an investigative reporter. Roaming the rain-streaked
streets in a tan trench coat, poring through
police reports till dawn at headquarters, meeting people named Sore Throat in dark alleyways. Life would be my beat and Truth would
be my lamp post.
And now the day is finally here. The day I
graduate from Katie Menzer, confused and

here wondered if thelist was somehow skewed.
"We're skeptical abouthow Swat is one of the
top 20 activist schools," said Jessica
Howington '9B, a leader of SPEEC, Students
Promoting Environmental Equity in Chester.
Swarthmore certainly has a long traditionof
student activism. Students in the' 40s and' 50s
worked for racial equality, anti-McCarthy ism,
and nuclear disarmament. Students in the' 60s
and '7os worked against the draft and the war
in Vietnam, and were active in "Urban Programs" to aid Chester students. "Swarthmore
got its reputation as an activist campus in the
'sos and '6os. That's why the name comes to
mind more than, say, Earlham," said Mary
Ellen Chijioke, curator of theFriends Histori-

slightly disturbedstaff writer, to Katie Menzer,

A December 1983 Swarthmore College
Bulletin article described activism on campus
then. "Nearly thirty campus groups, ranging
from the Alice Paul Women's Center and the
Committee in Solidarity with the Palestinians
and Lebanese to the Committee Opposing
Registration and the Draft and the Swarthmore Anti-Apartheid Committee...Students
who had a special interest not represented by
a club were encouraged to leave their name so
thatthose with similarinterests could be put in
touch with one another."
Students were working with Chester Tutorial and the Chester Community Improvement Project, which renovated abandoned
houses in Chester. The Swarthmore-Chester
Internship Program, "governed by a committee made up of Swarthmore professors and
administrators along with representatives of
the Chester community, each year will give up
to eight students stipends to cover their living

confused and slightly disturbed ace investigative reporter. I have hit upon a story that
is going to break this campus wide open. I'm
talking rioting, looting, raping and pillaging.
People will be barbecuing baby squirrels over
the smoldering ashes of Papazian and gorging themselves on bagels at Essie Mae's till
cream cheese freely flows out their noses.
Yes, I mean complete disintegration of Swarthmore as you know it.
So, here goes. The story that will change
your life forever. Swarthmore College is
deeply entrenched in an elaborate yet secret
program to dispose of trash. Yes, that's right
folks, trash. And this program is so secret it
only occurs under the cover of darkness, at
5:15 a.m., to be exact.
You probably never thought something
like this could happen here. That is, you never
thought it could happen here unless you just
happen to be a person living near one of their
secret disposal sites, the dumpsters. So unless
you live in Wharton, Willets, Mary Lyon,
Lodges, or Worth, you would have no idea
what Swarthmore was doing with trash in the
middle of the night. However, if you just
happen to live in Wharton, Willets, Mary
Lyon, Lodges, or Worth, you know all too
well what is going on with the trash disposal.
You know because it wakes you up at 5
o'clock in the morning every weekday. You
know because you lie in bed every morning
with your pillow covering your head praying
to the gods to either make the noise stop or let
you die now from suffocation. You know, oh
yes, you know.
But for those ofyou who don't know, those
many, many Swarthmore students who don't
live in Wharton, Willets, MaryLyon, Lodges,
or Worth, let me just describe to you
Swarthmore's dirty little secret. First, the
garbage truck drives up near the dumpster. It
reverses and backs into the dumpster, all the
while making that horrendous "I'mreversing
now" beeping noise to warn all those blind
people hanging out at the dumpster at 5 a.m.
to get out of the way. Then, the garbage truck
lifts up the dumpster as a bunch of guys shout
at each other and watch the trash fall noisily
into the truck. The truck lowers the dumpster.
Some guy casually looks into the dumpster,
notices there is more trash in the dumpster,
and moves the lever to have the truck raise the
dumpster again. Trash falls, men shout,
dumpster is again lowered. Guy again looks
into the dumpster, sees more trash, and the
saga continues three or four more times.
So, now you know the whole ugly truth,
and you're probably saying, "Katie, for the
love of God and all that is good and right in
the world, do something to stop the insanity!"
Well, friends, I've done all I can do. It is now
up to you. You as a community must rally
together. You must hold discussions, have
debates, and make web pages! You must
form a support group and offer free refreshments at meetings. We must force trash disposal out of the darkness and into mid-morning; I think 10:30 would be good.
This has been Katie Menzer reporting for
her own benefit. Thank you and good night.

expenses while they work full-time as unpaid volunteers for community groups and
social action services in Chester. Interns
may work for a three-month period during
the summer, or as long as 5 1/2 months
during the schools year, rather than taking
classes that semester. In some cases, the
work done by interns may qualify for academic credit."
Many such groups continue to exist on
campus. "The Progressive Action Caucus
started last year...lt exists to the extent that
progressive groups on campus want to be in
communication with each other," said Amy
Dalton '9B, a Caucus leader. Member organizations include Amnesty International, ProChoice Task Force, Empty the Shelters,
Swarthmore Civil Liberties Society,
Earthlust, SPEEC, and Feminist Majority.
Mother Jones specifically cited SPEEC s
work against further incinerator construction in Chester in its recent article. SPEEC

doesresearch for Chester organizations fighting the incinerators, and tries to educate both
Chester residents and people whose trash
feeds into the incinerators in Chester. "People
never seem to be educated enough," said
Howington.
"We can look at the situation as a machine," explained Chris Flood '99, another
SPEEC leader. "The political system is the
machine. Waste is the inffluent and the effluent. We can teach people how to deal with the
machine. We can work on source reduction—that's the inffluent. But it's hardest to change
the machine itself so the effluent isn't directed into Chester."
Howington and Flood said that the efforts
of SPEEC and the groups it works with in
Chester have begun to pay off. One incinerator was not built, and another may shut down.
A third had its pollution allotments renegotiated three times. SPEEC organized a threeday conference of colleges concerned with

Chester here last February, which has sparked
two statewide student protests.
Nonetheless, SPEEC leaders were surprised
by their prominent mention in Mother Jones.
"There are so many more activist groups on
campus, it's crazy for just environmental
issues to be mentioned," said Howington.
"But we think it's cool!" Flood added.
"There's an amazing amount of activism
on this campus," said Amy Albert '9B, a
leader in several student activist groups. "But
there's an inconsistent amount of institutional support foractivism on campus." Since
the CRC has become office space, she noted,
"none of the activist groups have space."
Albert noted that these programs are increasingly grassroots-oriented. "Students are
able to contribute what they're good at.. .it's
more coalition work with Chester...it enables us to do helpful and productive
work.. .the amount of work done has been a
tremendous success."

Today, Worth and the BCC; Tomorrow, the World?
Dave Mimno interviewed Linda Echols
The Phoenix.

for I'm

Phoenix: Over the summer, you became the
director of the BCC as well as the director of
Worth Health Center. Tell me a little about
how you became interim head of the Black
Cultural Center (BCC).
Linda Echols: Part ofit is that there weren't
that many administrators around, and Ngina
knew that I have been very active, and this is,
as she said, just a bridge.
P: When do they expect to get a permanent
director?
LE: I would expect the position to be posted
this fall, and filled before July Ist.
P: What do you do as head of the BCC?
LE: I am both director of the BCC and
associate dean, so what I do as director of the
BCC is coordinate outreach programs, academic support, advise student groups that are
affiliated withthe BCC, that sort of thing. Sort
of the parallel to the IC position.
P: What do you see as the role of the BCC
on campus?
LE: I see it in a variety of roles. First of all,
the director and the students arrangeprograms
to make sure that the program reflects black
issues or multiracial issues, so it's to add a
little balance to the program or to support
other people who are doing the balancing,
making sure that some of the student issues are
being addressed. That may include academic
support and other non-social-type support issues. So it's a place of academic support and
social support for the students. We keep our
fingers on issues in Black Studies.
P: What do you do as director of Worth
Health Center?
LE: I look at health policies and practices in
general, I administer the budget, and that's
whatI would do at the BCC as well, administer the budget, coordinate my own student
groups and outreach health-related groups.
People will come to me and say I wantto bring
this speaker or this speaker, I help them plan it
and support it. I also give direct care, because

a practitioner. I coordinate schedules.
Before I might have greeted more students
as the nurses do; I don't have time for that
now. But I still do my practitioning work,
and take care of coordinating care for problem students, with people in the hospital and
all that other stuff.
P: Do you think that the service or the
quality of the BCC or Worth has been compromised by you spreading yourself so thin?
LE: I think that people can handle it for
the short term. There's a difference when it's
short term. It's not only the BCC, because
the director was half time director and half
time associate dean, so I just couldn't do all
those things. I did not take some of the
dean's committee work, I did not take some
of the BCC's committee work. We also had
overlapping committees, because we were
on several committees together. So what I'm
going to say is that I don't know what it's
going to look like. I think both of them are

The Black Cultural Center

going to move along...We're moving along,
we're doing some additional programming
things, the kids seem to have things together.
I'm a task person, and I have a lot of experience, so I can facilitate things a little faster.
P: What sort of experience do you have?

LE: I' ve worked here a long time. I have a
lot ofeducation. And because I' ve been at the
school a long time, I know the school pretty
well, and I know the channels.
P: How long have you been here?
LE: Since 1981.1 have an MBA, so numbers and things come a little fast, some other
things come a little faster, so we save some
work in other areas. The one thing that's
getting aside is my dissertation, which is
slowing up a little again—l have to work on
that. You just set your priorities, and some
things will fall through. I don't know what's
going to happen. Because what I don't have
as much of is time for advising individual
students. Other people have to take that slack,
because that takes a lot of time. But we're
building our programming. There was no
programming set for this year, and generally
we try to plan a year in advance, but that
wasn't done, so I have to do that.
P: Is the selection process going on for a

permanent director?
LE: It will be soon, we've only been back
two weeks. We're trying to get Ngina to post
it in November. So the good thing about that
is that it forces everybody to think about what
they want the BCC to be as they're looking

for a new director.
P: What do you want the BCC to be?
LE: It's always, historically, been sort of a
refuge for students. A place where they can
go when they're homesick, when they need
some extra support, when they need that
physical comfort space. It's also a place for
academic support and social stuff. And a lot
of us were intimately related with the BCC,
we called it "the house," and the kids like that
idea. And at one point, when you said you
were going to the house, everybody knew
where the house was. People want that kind
of relationship withthe building and the people
in it again. It is a cultural center, and it is a
place for learning, it's a place for a lot of
things, but that's what we want. And we're
working towards it. We're going to have
study group sessions in the evening, and
invite professors to have evening pre-exam
study group sessions, so that it is a vibrant,
dynamic place.
P: Do you think you will have left your
mark on the BCC?
LE: No. Because I'm really a transition
person, and I make that be very clear. What I
have to do is help people think about what
they want, and help people to move along, to
come out of the shock from Maxine going,
and what expectations they have of me might
be different from the director, because I am
only a temporary person. So in some ways, I
think I have it easier than a regular person, but
we'll see as the year goes on.
P: Are you happy with trie way things are
going?
LE: Yeah. I was pretty surprised with how
well the students were doing during the transition. We're thinking about the kinds of
speakers we need to bring, and they came up
with some of the academic support ideas, and
I put my weight behind it. There's a big black
freshman class that comes from diverse places.
People care about keeping all the students of
color, and helping them succeed academically. It's nice to know that people are looking out for one another.

The Man Behind "Tumblers on the Left, Silverware on the Right"

Holmstrom, also known as

the employees in the servery area. He is also
there "to answer questions and bring comments to the appropriate management."
Smokey has worked in college food service for over 25 years. Previously, he has
been employed at Princeton University,
Brandeis College, the University of Maine,
and Whitman College. During his career, he
has seen an "interesting progression" in the
methods of college food service. At the beginning of his career, table service gave students very little choice. He notices that schools
have been "moving towards increasing variety with the introduction of things like salad

bars and beverage bars."
An important aspect of his job is to "meet
students and come up with ways to bemuse
them while they're standing in line." One
strategy, which Smokey started while working at Brandeis, is the board where daily trivia
questions are posted.
Another phenomenon which he intends to
bring to Sharpies soon is called "This Way
In." A scale will be placed in the dining hall
which students can use to weigh themselves.
At other schools, Smokey found this to be
very popular with students who "weighed
themselvesreligiously before or after meals."
Using this scale, he intends to start a game
which he calls "I'll guess your weight within
three [pounds], or you'll get in free." This
activity is not only entertaining, but also includes "a health aspect because often at college students are sedentary and eat more than
they need."

He intends to have guessing games for
students, too. Students can guess the weight
of large jars of beans or sugar. At other
schools, Smokey says, he noticed that "girls
came closest because when they picked up
the jarthey held it like a baby, while the guys
grabbed it and lifted it with two hands."
Swarthmore students have come to know
him as both "Smokey" and "the Warden."
There are stories behind each of these nicknames.
He was dubbed "Smokey" by the students
of Kent State. During a program to reduce
food waste, he "talked some kid into wearing [a Smokey Bear] costume as part of an
'Only You Can Prevent Food Waste' campaign. The kid backed out and I had to wear
the costume." Students immediately recognized him and subsequently began calling
him "Smokey." He has kept the nickname
for over 20 years because it "serves as an ice-

breaker for students. Instead of calling me
Mr. Holmstrom they can call me 'Smokey.'"
"TheWarden" originated from ajoke which
he played on the students at the University of
Maine. He told them that he was previously
a warden at a Texas prison. He said that since
he was the "new Warden," the next day there
were going to be "some new rules...starting
with no talking in line." Another rumor soon
began to circulate—that Smokey "had actually been a prison inmate and they would only
let me out if I took this job."
In his spare time, Smokey likes to collect
eagles made out of materials like pewter,
crystal, or wax. Currently, he has about 150
eagles. He enjoys listening to classical music
and vacationing by the ocean.
While on vacation, Smokey also goes to
other schools to "pick up ideas and solutions
to problems. Food directors always enjoy
having visitors."

Smokey sees Swarthmore as the "culmination of his career in college dining service"
because ofits campus, students, and location.
Since most students eat at Sharpies for their
entire four years here, it is "a challenge," but
one which he is excited about. When the firstyears "come in the fall, I feel like myself.
Every year is like a renewal cycle."

Cross-Country Team Promising at
First Intercollegiate Competition
By

Nevin Katz, Karen Lloyd,

This weekend Swarthmore's cross-country team faced its first dose ofreal intercollegiate competition. After a scantily-prepared
Sharpies breakfast, the team scurried into the

and support shown by both teams. In addition
to the encouraging words at the starting line,
shouts of "Go Swat!" as well as other things
flew across the course during both races. The
men cheered for the women's race during
their warm-up and the women for the men's
race during their cool-down.
Both men's and women's teams were able
to use the vast array of competition to their
advantage. Co-captain Danielle Wall '9B led
the women's team, finishing in 13th place at
20:41. Ted was "very pleasantly surprised at
how Danielle had come over the summer.
She's truly stepping up to a new level."

The course was a veritable cross-country

Among 30 teams in the race, Swarthmore's

in one foul swoop, commenting that "running
is a love/hate relationship. In this race, there
was a little bit of love, and a little bit of hate,
but it was one, big, fast, smorgasbord offun."
Lucks agreed, saying the meet was "simply

on the day: "Saturday's race was not only a
journey from start to finish. Oh no. It was
much more. The very essence of my being
was involved in this race, and it told me one

thing; run."
Dixon's view of the day was nothing short

the past, and that's encouraging. On the men' s
squad, I was very surprised at how fast Liam

fast Josh Bloom 'OO proved that he could be
a factor on the varsity squad. I did not anticipate for either of these things to happen until
they were at least sophomores! I was also
pleased to see seniors Weinstein and Boeye
making such fast recoveries from injuries."
This weekend, the teams will journey to
Baltimore to take on Johns Hopkins.

Women's Soccer Looking to Win
By

Beth Wiles

On Saturday, the women's soccer team

suffered the ignominy oftraveling in a school
bus for two hours on their way to thePoconos
to take on Misericordia College. The team
was looking to rebound from its loss to Widener University last Tuesday.
Unfortunately, the Garnet started shakily
and found itself down two goals to none early
in the first half. Led by the defense ofcaptain
Claire Baxter '9B and the solid play of Sarah
Jaquette '9B on the front line, the team slowly
began to regroup. However at half-time the
team found itself down 3-0.
In the second half momentum shifted as the

Garnet's front line fire power took control,

Women's Rugby Ready for First
Game Saturday Against Bucknell
By

Jen Philpott

After three full weeks of practice and a
rocking good party, the women's rugby team
is prepared to tackle Bucknell University this
weekend. Swarthmore's ruggers will be playing Bucknell at 11:00 a.m. on Saturday for
the first time in a year. The last match-up was
in the fall of 1995 when the teams played to
a 5-5 tie.
In addition to this being Swarthmore's first
match against Bucknell in a year, it is also
their first game of the season. The team that
will take the field will havemany new players
and several returning players in different
positions. If the level of play the week before
the game is any indication of potential in a
rugby game, though, Bucknell will have their
hands full on Saturday.

Rain and sickness plagued practice all week.
Nevertheless, Swarthmore managed to learn
all of the game skills necessary for play this
weekend. The forwards have learned all about
scrums and line-outs. The backs have a full
repertoire of plays to run. There are always
surprises in the first game of each season, but
captains Hanan Hussein '97 and Andrea
Barnett '97 are confident that their leadership
and that of other returning players will help
the team. "We still have a lot to learn, but
once we get out on the field, we will just step
up and play the best game we can possibly
play," said Elin Lisska '97.
The forward pack will be led by Hussein at
loose forward and Jen Philpott '97 at scrumhalf. Other experienced players in the forward pack are Leora Cohen-McKeon '9B,
Sarah Cross '99, Becky Snyder'9B, and Char-

ity Miller '9B. The back line will be led by

fly-half Karli Watson '97, who will be playing this position for the first time in an A-side
game,and Barnett at inside center. Beth Vose
'99, Elin Lisska '97, and Morgan Kelly '9B
will provide depth to the team as returning
players.
"I am nervous about playing a new position, but this team is really coming together
and I think that we have a good chance
against Bucknell," said Watson.
Given that the current women's rugby roster is only 25 people deep and a rugby team

comprises 15 players, it is guaranteed that
quite a few A-side players will also be playing B-side on Saturday. With so much opportunity to gain experience, it is only a matter of
time before this team becomes a power to
contend with in their division.

This Saturday, the Swarthmore
football team kicks off its Centennial
Conference schedule with a home
opener against the Johns Hopkins
Bluejays. The game, starting at 1:30
p.m. on Clothier Field, will feature
two teams coming off of tough losses

in their first games of the season.
The Garnet Tide, which was dealt
a 42-21 loss at the hands of the Newport News Shipbuilders two weeks
ago, are hoping to capitalize on some
of the weaknesses that Hopkins
showed in last week'sloss to Fairleigh
Dickinson University.
Due to a bye-week, the Tide has
had two weeks of practice to prepare
for the Bluejays' offensive and defensive schemes. The Tide hope to
exploit the relatively young Hopkins
offense which is led by a freshman
quarterback. The confidence of the
Tide's defense is tempered by the
fact that the Bluejays' offensive attack has traditionally been strong.
The Tide has added a number of
new wrinkles on offense in the past
week, one of which is a new shotgun
formation. Head Coach Karl Miran
will also be featuring a new sleeker
passing look, which will take greater
advantage of the speed ofsophomore
wideouts Brian Bell '99 and Mason
Tootell '99. The offense has high
hopes to score early and often.
Overall, the Garnet Tide is extremely confident going into the game
this Saturday, and hope that when the
fourth quarter has ended, a message
will be sent to the entire Centennial
Conference: The Tide will be rolling
in this year!

Men's
Soccer
By

Shulamit Shapiro

Despite their enthusiasm after a
convincing win over Albright, the
men's soccer team was unable to continue its winning streak. Last weekend the team lost to Drew 1-0, and
Wednesday the team lost to
Millersville 3-0.
The last game was particularly challenging, given that Millersville is a
Division II team, one division ahead
of Swarthmore. "We definitely have
our heads down a little bit," said Scott
"I Only Smoke Camels" Samels '99.
While Samels contends that the
team "played a tough game," he also
admitted that there were some prob-

lems.
Kyle "House ofStyle" Barnett '97,
one of the team's co-captains, was
ejected in the first half of the game for
a red card infraction. Dave "In the
Fast" Lane '97, another co-captain,
did not play at all due to an injury.
"We had some opportunities, but
we failed to put them into use. If we
had used them, we could have
changed the dynamic of the game,"

said Samels.
Samels contends that the players
are still getting used to playing to-

gether as a team.
"There are a lot of new players on
the team this year. We're also trying
a new system this year. We're trying
to pass the ball more often, rather
than just trying to kick it really far
and hope that it makes it," Samels

said.
Nevertheless, according to Samels,
these preliminary games are relatively
unimportant. While they do provide
the team with extra practice and dictate the overall morale, they do not
indicate how well a team will fare
over the course of the season.
"It is the conference matches that
are really important. If you win them,
then you automatically go to the
NCAA Tournament," said Samels.
The NCAA, or NationalCollegiate
Athletic Association, holds a tournament at the end of the season for the

top teams in a variety of sports. The
team aspires to earn a berth in this

prestigious tournament.
Samels is confident that the team
will perform at its peak when it faces
Johns Hopkins on Saturday in its first
Centennial Conference match of the
year.
"Johns Hopkins will be the toughest opponent we've faced yet. I'm
sure that our team will be ready to
Play," said Samels.

Volleyball Falls to
Franklin & Marshall
Young team struggles
to execute skills
learned in practice
By

David Lischer

The schedule-makers gave the
Swarthmore women's volleyball
team a tough draw by pairing them
against Franklin and Marshall in their

first Centennial Conference match.
Despite the fact that it is early in the
season, the Diplomats appeared to be
in mid-season form and handed the
Garnet a 15-2, 15-6, 15-3 defeat.
Nearly every Diplomat player utilized a jump-serve, but the Garnet
was prepared for them. When running drills in practice Coach Larry
Perry hits the ball with the exaggerated topspin that jump serves create.
The Diplomat hitters were able to
find holes in the Garnet's black defense. "We got a few touches, but
neither Heather [Stickney '9B] nor I
got straight blocks. We need to work
on being aggressive... part of it is
anticipation, being where you're supposed to be, and then going full-out.
You really have to watch their eyes
and follow their body," said middle-

hitter Wendy Williams '97.
The team's relative inexperience
both on the court in game situations
and playing with one another has
been a factorinits early season losses.
At this stage many players know and
understand where to be on the court,
but the instincts that get them there
are still being developed. Furthermore, there are only two returning
starters from last year's squad.
The Garnet have been struggling
with their consistency in several areas, notably receiving serves and passing. Thus far the team has played
much more consistently in practice
and needs only to carry the same
level of play into matches.
The day after the loss to the Diplomats, the captains held a practice
during which the players discussed
their impressions of the game and
their goals for the rest of the season.
The meeting should help bring the
team together before Thursday night's
match against Widener and this
weekend's tri-match withconference
rivals Bryn Mawr and Gettysburg,
against whom the Garnet hope to
enact a measure of revenge for last
season's defeats. The Garnet host

If the first week of Fall Ball is any
indication of the upcoming lacrosse
season, the men's lacrosse team is off
to a great start. In the coming months
the team will be working hard and
enjoying the game they all love.
The Swarthmore men's lacrosse
team started off the 20th century by
winning intercollegiate lacrosse
championships in 1900, 1904, and
1905. Since then the team has won 14
league or conference championships.
This year's team hopes to finish off
the century just as strongly as they
have started it.

Swarthmore had many scoring
opportunities.which resulted from the
energized performance of Samantha

the normally two-hour trip had taken
over four hours.
At the tournament the next day, the
team had mixed success. In the "A"
singles division, John Derderian '97
lost 8-6 in a third set tiebreaker, and
Nick Slimack '99 lost to a powerserving Rutgers player. In the "B"
flight, Steve Richards '99 lost his
match, while Greg Emkey '99 won
his first match and lost his second in
a third set tiebreaker. In the "C"
flight, Jon Temin 'OO lost his first
match to a steady baseliner from Penn
State, while John Leary 'OO won his
match comfortably and lost his second, also to a Penn State player, after
holding two match points. In the "D"

Sacha Sheehan 'OO won their first
match but lost the second.
The team was not as successful in
doubles. First-doubles, Temin and
Slimack, lost to a couple of sevenfooters from Seton Hall, while
Derderian and Leary were defeated
by a team from Bloomsburg. In the
"B" flight, Emkey and Sheehan lost
to a team from Army, while Richards
and Wachter succumbed to a Rutgers
doubles team.
This weekend, Swarthmore hosts
the Tim Berman Invitational. The
team will have their
hands full with such
perennial powerhouses as UPenn,
Temple and Yale.

This play was typical ofPeltz's great
game last Saturday.
Coach Borbee described the match
as "another outstanding game. The
fact that many people got to play was
a testament to the depth of the team.
Lauren Hopkins '9B was great in the
goal," said Borbee. Hopkins continues to play well while starting goalie
Kelly Wilcox '97 remains sidelined
following a concussion. In the second half, WM had the chance to tie
the game on a penalty stroke. Since
the ball hit the foot of a Swarthmore
defender in the box, the only thing
that stoodbetween WM and the tying
goal was Hopkins, who must have

Coach Gress is pleased so far with
the high talent level of the newcomers and feels that the "fall season is

When asked about Coach Gress,
senior captain Pete Hamilton replied,
"he works hard on recruiting, so we
have some powerful first year prospects, and he's fun to play for, which
brings in people from all kinds of
lacrosse backgrounds."
This season the Garnet will face a
demanding schedule facing Division
I Drexel University and a Centennial
Conference which boasts threeteams
perennially ranked in the NCAA Division 111 top ten. To top it all off, the
Garnet are facing the loss of nine
seniors. However, the team has a
strong nucleus with captains Pete
Hamilton '97, Pat Donaghy '9B, and
Aaron Hultgren '9B. Along with the
return ofkey veterans, the addition of

'9B, who pushed
it in past the goalie," said Duffy. It is
nice to see the Garnet scoring off the
corner plays, for they have had many
in their season already, but until now
had yet to capitalize on them. According to Duffy, the team tried to
focus "on keeping our sticks down in
crucial situations, and I think we did
this much better than we have been
doing. We also played really well as
a team: supporting each other and
talking and using our passing game."
Teamwork is what everyone who
talks about the field hockey team
mentions. With camaraderie and unselfishness working for them, the
Garnetshould tally many more victories this season.
