Yearly Sager Symposium
cancelled by Committee

Staff Writer

Debators Damon Taaffe '99 (right) and John Dolan 'Ol
recently brought attention to Swarthmore by placing
first in the Bucknell Invitational Debate Tournament last
weekend. Taaffe and Dolan have met with success as
a team, placing high at other tournaments this semester, and are currently ranked fourth in the nation. The
pair will continue to compete in national tournaments
until Dolan goes abroad in February.

This year, the Sager Committee, chaired by Professor
Pieter Judson, has decided not
to hold the Symposium, an annual event which has taken
place for the past ten years. Instead, the committee has decided to focus on adding a
Queer Studies Concentration to
the curriculum at Swarthmore.
The purpose of the Sager
Committee, which was established ten years ago by alumni
action, is to look out for the interests of gay, bisexual, and lesbian students, faculty, and staff
on campus. The committee also

works to increase visibility of
queer issues on campus and
fights homophobia to make the
campus a safer place for queer
members of the College community.
Each year, the committee
receives an annual gift from Richard Sager, which has traditionally been used to sponsor
the Sager Symposium. These
symposiums have focused on a
variety of issues in the past
years including community activism and queer cinema. The
Symposium, held over a weekend in conjuction with other
events, worked to increase the

West named new college VP
by Anne Hoang

Staff Writer

Last week, Dan West became
Swarthmore's newest administrative addition as the college's Vice President for
Development, Alumni Relations, and
Public Relations. The search to fill this
position began late last December after
the unexpected and upsetting death of
Harry Gotwals, the previous Vice President, last October.
Since this crucial position required a
candidate of high caliber, in terms of experience and energy, the search circumvented normal application processes. Instead, a search firm was hired to assemble
a list of possible candidates to present to
a group of board members and administrators. Through a series of interviews
and meetings with faculty and staff, the
prospective list was narrowed to one candidate who is then invited to serve in the
VP position. In the second cycle of applicants, West accepted the offer to join
the Swarthmore community as VP.
West's accomplishments represent a
broad spectrum of experience and knowledge. West graduated from Austin College in Texas, went on to receive degrees
in biblical studies from Union Theological Seminary, systematic theology from
Vanderbilt University, and education administration from Harvard University.

President Bloom hosts fireside chat
Staff Writer

Myriad controversial topics
were thrown around Kohlberg
Coffee Bar Thursday night
when President Al Bloom
fielded questions at a "Fireside
Chat." The approximately 40
students that took a break from
finals preparations to attend the
Student Council sponsored
event heard Bloom's opinions
on pay for the Phoenix staff,
Swarthmore as a supportive environment for minority students,
college enrollment, the effectiveness of Student Council, the
creation and elimination of faculty positions, and environmentally responsible financial investing. Active debate did not
play a major role in the event,
though the president by no
means dominated the discussion. Hopefully this hour with
Bloom will be the first of many
such "chats" this year.

remain at its current level of
1375 students for at least the
next ten years. Bloom did explain that there are pressures to
make the college grow. For comparison, he pointed out, Amherst
has approximately
1800 students while
Wellsley and Williams both exceed an
enrollement of 2000.
Two major factors,
uv vA F iained, are admissions
pressure and range of diversity.
In regards to the first, "the college is turning away thousands
of applicants that would thrive
at Swarthmore and make excellent contributions to our environment." As for the diversity of
the student body, Bloom made
the point that with only 360 or
370 students in a class, it is very
difficult to ensure that all departments and interests are represented. There will be some years
where there are fewer engineers
than desired and some years
where there will not be enough

The conversation then
moved to student government
when one student asked the
president his opinions on the
effectiveness of student government at Swarthmore College,
saying he felt that Student
Council, SAC, and SBC were
not acting responsibly in the best
interests of the student body. A
specific complaint was the lack
of objectivity in the decision
making by these bodies. Bloom
stressed that he appreciated the
efforts made by the students in
leadership positions and that it
is "a hard struggle to represent
1300 students... any group is
going to be swayed by emotions." He suggested giving SC
a channel through which to

Planning group decides
to increase Swat visibility
by Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Staff Writer
That Swarthmore needs to
increase its visibility, especially to employers and graduate schools, was the conclusion of the long-range planning group on visibility and
leadership in higher education.
The planning group,
which reported to the Board of
Managers last Friday, recommended last semester that
Swarthmore increase outreach
to corporations, graduate
schools, prospective students,
the media and the country's
leaders.
"Here in the late 1990'5,
colleges and universities all
over the country are competing for the public spotlight,"
Director of the News and InOffice
formation
Tom
Krattenmaker said in an interview.
One rationale for the effort
was that some alumni were
having trouble finding jobs.
"We were getting a lot of anecdotes from young graduates," said Krattenmaker.
"[Their] prospective employers were not familiar with
Swarthmore or the value of a
Swarthmore degree."
In addition to intensifying
outreach, the planning group's
report recommended giving
the appearances of publications a consistent look, ensuring that all departments' web
sites are of professional qual-

ity, adding a media relations
specialist, and increasing the
budget for the Office of News
and Information.
Also on the agenda is the
development of initiatives,
such as a college-funded internship program, to improve
Swarthmore's name recognition in educational leadership.
As outreach to the public
and corporations, the report
recommended mailing publications to businesses and the
public. But Krattenmaker said
the College Planning Committee has "shied away" from
some of those recommendations. "[There] doesn't seem to
be community-wide support
for some of the more intensive
[projects]," he said.
Reporting to the board,
Krattenmaker listed several
"great media placements" this
semester, including a US News
and World Report feature revealing Swarthmore as having
low grade inflation.
According to a study
Krattenmaker performed,
Swarthmore has had a better
portrayal in newspapers such
as the New York Times than
have other colleges.
Krattenmaker is hoping
the US News report will increase Swarthmore's visibility, and he said that the Career Planning and Placement
office is using that report for
outreach.
Krattenmaker is also intersee VISIBILITY, pg. 3

a proceeding. Laws suggest
that beginning in January, all
100 members of the Senate
will be required to attend the
trial all day long, six days a
week for as long as it lasts. No
business may be conducted in
the Senate before the trial
ends.
And
since Chief
Justice William Rehnquist
will preside
over the proceedings as
judge, the Supreme Court
will be shut
down as well.
There
may be quite a
bit of controversy before
the trial even begins. The
Congress now in session is a
"lame-duck" Congress, since
new elections were held in November and the next Congress
will be replacing this one next
month. Law dictates that any
bill passed by a lame-duck
House must be passed by the
Senate before the new Congress takes over; otherwise,
the new Congress must also

approve the bill. How does
this work with impeachment?
It has never come up, to be
sure, but Yale Law School
Prof. Bruce Ackerman, who
testified before the Judiciary
Committee in defense of the
President, says that a lameduck impeachment is unconstitutional. Might we have to
go through this whole mess
again in January, or will
Rehnquist risk incorrect procedure in such a delicate matter as impeachment of the
President?
Perhaps the most profound
difficulty with this impeachment is one that cannot be argued with legal terms. Ultimately, this impeachment is
wrong because it is bears no resemblance to democratic sentiment. Polls show consistently
that the vast majority ofAmericans do not want President
Clinton removed from office.
Information regarding Bill
Clinton's philandering became
public knowledge in 1992, and
he has been twice elected president since that time. It may be
deplorable that the public wants
a freak show in Washington, but
what it doesn't want is a reason
to tune into Court TV.

Third, about 90 percent of
American children go to public schools, while 10 percent
attend private ones. If vouchers were offered, where are all
of the public school kids going to use them? Simply put,
there are not enough schools.

ones who will

the poor kids,
the inner city kids, will see no
rewards from this system. Further, and this is key, they will
be adversely affected by
vouchers. The money that pays
for vouchers comes out of* the
public schools' funds. Their
schools will be expected to
"compete" with private schools,

while at the same time having
their resources siphoned off.
Ask any economics professor;
these schools will fail to educate their students.
"Education as a whole really does not interest me that
much," says Kaufman. Clearly
not. Education, however, is
important. If we are to reproduce our society and our democracy, then we need people
with at least some basic level
of education. Granted, the current system does a poor job of
educating inner city kids;
vouchers, however, will completely shut out these students.
Vouchers will not improve
education for all students;
likely, it will only be a better
system for some, those that are
chosen by the private schools.
Vouchers will create an educational system of haves and
have nots that will not be unlike the famous constitution
from George Orwell's Animal
Farm: "All animals are created
equal. Some animals are more
equal than others." I am sorry,
Simon, if you are not familiar
with this text. Perhaps vouchers would have taught it to
you. Perhaps you can go to

Swattie responds School vouchers exacerbate social ills
to US News article
by Julie Russo
Contributing Writer
Editor's Note:
The following is a response written to a recent articlepublished in the US News
and Weekly Report, condemning the rally in response to the
IC incident. The report was
entitled, "Good Hair, Bad
Cake," and was written by
John Leo.

I am truly sorry that the
members of the Swarthmore
community have offended or
disturbed Mr. Leo's feelings
with our apparently assaultive
concern with
own
our
(Good Hair,
Bad Cake).
One of the
hardest
things for us
in trying to
explain the
desecration
of our Intercultural Center to the outside media
has been that
no one seems
underto
stand why
we think that
a few piles of cake and sprinkles
are such a big deal. We have
fostered something at Swarthmore which is perhaps anomalous in our culture: a community where mutual respect and
tolerance for difference is the

of what color their skin is or
what kind of hair they have or
what clothes they wear; and just
as importantly, we think that if
people don't feel safe and respected, it is everybody's problem. It is misleading to ignore
the fact that there are events provoking these feelings of threat:
someone deliberately made a
mess in the Intercultural Center,
just as someone wrote homophobic and racist comments
on signs, grafittied "fuck fags"
along with a student's name in
a bathroom,: and set fire to a
student's door. Beyond that, is
itreally so illogical to define the
offense by who is offended?
The disgruntled parents and staff of
PS 75 had the
opportunity to
talk with Ruth
Sherman about
her intentions in
bringing
"Nappy Hair"
into her classroom, and it is
distressing that
they chose to
attack her rather
than working
with her. At
Swarthmore,
we have no such option when
anonymous acts that we interpret as hate speech are perpetrated. Indeed, the speaker's
decision to remain anonymous
is one of the things that suggests to us that his or her intentions were not so innocent.
We can only reaffirm, in our
"support groups" and as a
campus at large, our
committment to the belief that
everyone does, indeed, have a
right not to feel attacked because of who they are.
Perhaps I am an idealist,
but I will not be told that the
best world is one in which it's
okay for me to be verbally,
physically, or economically
assaulted because of my race
or sexual orientation. And I
can not help thinking that
things might change for the
better if everyone would just
follow the example of Swarthmore and care more
not
less about how what we say
and do makes other people
feel.

We can only

reaffirm that
everyone has a
right not to feel
attacked because of who
they are.

norm.

The physical violation
of the institutional infrastructure supporting this tolerance,
whatever the "facts" are about
its motivation, was something
that profoundly shocked not
only the minorities who use
the space, but the entire college community, the 500 students, faculty, and staff who
came to the rally and the others who could not be there but
expressed their support. This
is a sign that at Swarthmore
we are immersed in the radical proposition that one should
actually care about how other
people feel. We value the fact
that everyone has a right to an
environment where they feel
safe and respected regardless

It really is too bad that
Simon Kaufman, author of last
week's "School vouchers provide better education," did not
have access to school vouchers. Perhaps if he had, and had
received superior instruction,
he would not have produced
such an ignorant and misguided homage to the merits
of school vouchers. Vouchers
do not, as many people claim,
provide a better education for
everyone. The notion that
"there really is no contesting
the educational superiority of
vouchers" is roundly false.
For starters, vouchers do
nothing for poor, minority, or
poorly performing students,
those whose achievement is
the most worrisome. In no
publicly-funded voucher program in existence today, or
ever in existence, was the
voucher amount equal to the
amount of tuition at most private schools. Usually, the
voucher covers anywhere from
one-half to two-thirds of tuition. One wonders where par-

PLO Leaders Vote to Amend
Charter

In an important step for-

ward for the peace process,

105 senior leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization
have voted to amend their
organization's charter, removing clauses that call for the destruction of the state of Israel.
The vote was taken by the
Palestinian Central Council as
a preliminary to a vote by the
full Palestinian National
Council; it fulfills a promise
made as part of the 1993
framework for Mideast peace
and repeated as part of this
year's Wye accord.
Nobel Prizes Awarded in
Stockholm and Oslo
The Nobel Prizes in Literature, Chemistry, Physics,

Medicine or Physiology, and
Economics were presented to
their recipients by King Carl

XVI Gustaf of Sweden in a
ceremony at Stockholm's
KonserthusetHall. The recipients of the $943,000 prize then
addressed the audience at
1,200-person banquet.
The recipients of the
Nobel Peace Prize, David
Trimble and John Hume of
Northern Ireland, received
their prizes in Oslo, Norway.
All of the prizes were presented on December 10, the
anniversary of the death of
Alfred Nobel.
Pinochet to Face Extradition
to Spain
The British government
has reluctantly decided to endorse the extradition of former
Chilean dictator Augusto
Pinochet to Spain, where he
faces charges of crimes
against humanity,
His wife, meanwhile,
vowed defiance: "He will
never lack the strength of mind
to hold his head high in the
name of Chile," she told a
crowd of supporters.
Spanish
magistrate
Baltasar Garzon has sought
the former dictator's extradition to face charges of torture,
terrorism, and genocide relating to his 17-year dictatorship,
in which 3000 people (including Spanish citizens) died or
disappeared.

The House Judiciary Committee finished its work on the
Clinton impeachment inquiry this
week, giving the president's lawyers a chance to offer a defense
and receiving closing statements
from the majority and minority
counsel. Defenders of the president who included White House
Counsel Charles Ruff, historian
Sean Wilentz, and former Massachusetts Governor William
Weld, argued that the president's
actions in the Lewinsky affair
were inappropriate and "sinful"
but did not warrant Clinton's removal. The committee is expected to vote to approve at least
one of the four articles of impeachment, two dealing with perjury, one with obstruction of justice, and one with abuse of power.
The full House will vote on impeachment next week.
Maj. Gen. Faces Sex Charges
Retired Major General David
Hale has been charged by the
army with 17 counts of wrongdoing, stemming from improper
relationships with the wivesiof
four other officers and his
coverup. Hale is charged with
"conduct unbecoming an officer,"
making false statements to army
investigators, and obstruction of
justice. The case is the latest in a
long series of sexual misconduct
investigations that have plagued
the army. Hale has served as both
deputy inspector general of the
army and as commanding general
of NATO's allied land forces in
southeastern Europe.
Affirmative Action Cartoon
Leads to Controversy at Ultt
The publication of a controversial cartoon on affirmative
action at the University of
Rhode Island's student newspaper led to protests. The cartoon,
about the end of affirmative action at the University of Texas,
shows a white professor addressing an African-American
entering the classroom. "If
you're the janitor, please wait
until after class to empty the
trash," the professor says. "If
you're one of our minority students, welcome!" Protestors label it as the latest in a series of
racial insults;and the student
senate froze the newspaper's
funding, though funding was restored after a campus forum on
racial issues.

Haverford Students Accuse Honor Council of Violating
Honor Code
Three students announced on Sunday that they are officially accusing Haverford's Honor Council of violating of the
Honor Code. This unprecedented action followed the Council's
decision to continue to delay the release of an abstract [case
summary for an Honor Code violation] beyond one year, a
violation of the text of the Honor Code.
Since November, the Council has informed the community about the case in question which they say concerns a violation "so singular in nature" that they cannot release the abstract while the individuals involved are still at the College. A
previous Council decided in secret to delay the abstract beyond one year, and the current Council, after informing the
community about the previous Council's actions, announced
early last week that they will not overturn that decision.
Honor Council members refused to comment on this story.
Bryn Mawr Student Web Pages Rediscovered
Student webmaster Anneke Hackman announced that all
150 student web pages at Bryn Mawr have been recovered.
Students feared that their pages may have been accidently lost.
The problem was apparently caused during an upgrade of
Bartik, when the web page files were accidentally hidden in
an incorrect directory.

Students' Council invalidates Honor Council chair nomi-

nation
Haverford's Students' Council decided last week to invalidate the nomination of Ben Huebner 'Ol and Anthony*
Minko 'Ol for Honor Council Co-Chairs because both intend
to go abroad next year and would not be able to fulfill the
second semester of their term. Students' Council maintains a
right to determine the constitutionality of Honor Council Chair
elections. At the time Students' Council made the decision to
invalidate the nomination, Huebner and Minko were the onjy.
candidates, but since then Scott Burau 'O2 and Jared laokel'
'O2 have announced their candidacy for Co-Chairs.

As the admissions staff
works hard to send out early
decision letters, it is clear that
this is another busy year for
the Admissions Office. With
the numbers of prospectives
and applicants increasing dramatically over the past few
years, leading up to a recordbreaking 1997-98, there always seems to be a buzz of activity in the middle of Parrish.
The expectation is that 1998'99 will continue the trend.
While actual numerical figures
were not available to the Phoenix at press time, Dean of Admissions Robin Mamlet
stated, "The traffic has seemed
pretty much the same as it has
the past couple falls. In other
words, we've been busy!"
The
question
on
everyone's mind is, "How big
is the class of 2003 going to
be?" In many conversations

around campus one can hear
murmurs of "housing crunch,"
"Strath Haven," and "screwed
in the lottery." In addition,
with the publicity given to the
capital projects for the future,
one of which is a new dorm,
the Swarthmore community
has been thinking about the
size of the college and how
that affects our environment.
According to Mamlet, the Admissions Office is "shooting
for a class of 360 first-years."
There are not numerical goals
for applications, but Admissions does try to admit the
right number of students to
yield 360 matriculants. The
yield expectation includes the
factors of early admits, of
which about 100 are anticipated, in addition to students
who were admitted last year
and deferred.
Regardless of the yield factors and how many students are
expected to actually come to
Swarthmore, the Admissions

Office has had to increase its
capacity to handle the increased
number of inquiries and applications. Work crews are transforming several offices on the
beach side of Parrish Ist into
more space for Admissions.
Last year the Admissions Office
asked President Bloom for some
extra funds from his discretionary account, and this year the
regular operating budget has
been increased.
In addition, there has been
a lot more work done by everyone from student tour
guides to the support staff and
deans. Arlene Mooshian, who
has worked behind the reception desk for 18 years, has
seen the office grow and transform into the efficient organization that it is today. She told
the Phoenix, "The support
staff and everyone cover each
other... [Whether] it's ringing
phones or paperwork, this office is supported by a real team
effort. It always has been."

OPINIONS PIECE:

Declaration of Human Rights
weakened by controversial content
by David Ellis

Staff Writer

This week, the United Nations Declaration of Human
Rights celebrated its birthday.
Clearly the creation of this
document articulated a beautiful vision for an ideal society. In general, I firmly believe
that the citizens of nations that
follow this declaration will
have superior lives. Almost all
articles contained within this
declaration are essential protections for people around the
world from oppressive governjnehts-'This was commemorated last night at the bell
tower in an inspiring candlelight vigil.
In spite of the many vitally important issues raised
by the declaration, I do feel
that some of the rights it advocates are extremely controversial. For example, the charter declares that everyone has
the right to paid holidays (article 24). Yes, ultimately everyone should be able to afford to take paid vacation in
the ideal state. Unfortunately,
not every nation in the world
can afford to take a couple
weeks off a year. Are we going to approach a sufficiently
poor nation and declare them
a human rights abuser because
they do not offer free vacation
time?
Additionally, the Declaration ofHuman Rights declares
that everyone has the right to
join labor unions, (article 23)
True, this was the conventional
thinking fifty years ago. Unfortunately, it has been proven
that labor unions ultimately act
to limit labor competition
within their industry in order
to boost wages, thus often denying employment to workers
who otherwise would have
been amiably working. Regardless of whether or not this
is morally justified, it is ridiculous to put such a controversial provision in a universal
declaration of human rights. Is
it not each nation's right to
conduct a cost-benefit analy-

sis of labor unions and determine whether or not they are
beneficial, as opposed to having controversial ideas mandated by international charters?
Additionally, the Declaration of Human Rights declares
that everyone has the implicit
right to receive welfare benefits
for an indeterminable amount of
time, as well as free medical
care (article 25). Granted, some
members of society believe this.
Clearly most Americans do not.
This was evidenced by the defeat of health care in 1994 and
welfare reform in 1996. All of

Myanmar and China and
claim they are violating fundamental human rights, when
many of these "universal" human rights are so intellectually
contentious?
It is self-defeating and incredibly stupid to put controversial provisions in such an
important and pervasive document. Many of the economic
rights should be determined
by each nation individually
through the political process.
We cannot institutionalize human rights when we include
legitimately controversial articles. It weakens the. signifi- i
cance of all human rights
when we include beyond the
necessities. The continuation
of inessential, controversial
human rights articles has been
detrimental to human rights
victims in the past. For example, the Soviet Union legitimized its mass murdering
of peasants by declaring that
America did not have a universal welfare system, and
thus the United States had no
moral upper ground to attack
on.

campus, and also brought
alumni and students together.
This year, however, Judson
stated that the committee felt
that it was more important to
work on long-term visibility of
queer issues at Swarthmore. In
previous years, so much energy
would go into planning the symposium that the committee
would be burned out afterward
and would be unable to complete other projects. This year,
instead of holding the symposium, the committee has decided to sponsor three separate
events in the spring while focusing on adding a Queer Studies
Concentration to the curriculum.
"This new concentration
requires a lot of work," stated
Judson, "because we need to
make sure that the proposal
shows that such a concentration
would be intellectually sound
and rigorous" for it to be passed
by the faculty. He also stated
that the committee was working
to make the concentration available to the Tri- College community and that the proposal included incorporating a community-based learning component.
Many students, however,
have expressed concern because
the Sager Symposium will not
be held this year. Tim StewartWinter 'Ol, is concerned because he feels that the
committee's activities this year
will be less visible without the
symposium. He said that "For
a lot of Swatties, Sager weekend is the only time when queer
studies aren't marginalized at
Swarthmore."
However, he does support
the long-term work the committee is doing. "It's great that
they're exploring the curricular
side of queer fife "-"he' said, ,f*but:: '
I hope that after taking a year
off the committee will again
hold a high-profile of queer
events." Judson has stated that
the committee is planning to go
back to the symposium in the
future, but did not give a definite time.
Stewart-Winter is also concerned that students will not be wellinformed about the work the committee is doing. He states that"The
committee should give queer students a timeline stating when and
how they plan to have the concentration in place."
Judson, in conjunction withthe
Sager Committee, plans to have
open meetings in the spring so that
sutdents may take an active role in
the formation of the Queer Studies
Concentration.

Bloom answers students' questions

knowledged that the issue of

adding or eliminating positions from specific departments is a sensitive one. "Adding faculty positions is very
expensive, but every position
adds something. A position
4oes not become obsolete because knowledge keeps expanding and the faculty members will keeps themselves up
to date." He summed up by
telling the group that his
model for the college is "judicious growth" in all aspects.
The final topic addressed

by Bloom before the end ofthe
official gathering was responsible endowment investing. A
concerned student inquired
about "shifting endowment investment to firms with environmentally sound practices."
Bloom explained that it is his
goal to make Swarthmore an
"intentionally ethical community", but that withdrawing
investments from every company with questionable practices is not feasible. First, the
goal that alums and others
have when they donate money
into the endowment is that the
funds will be used to their

maximum potential. To that
end, the college must invest in
companies that are giving
good returns, as long as they
are legal of course. Furthermore, Bloom illustrated that
one could choose any company and find something
wrong with it; if not environmental irresponsibilities then
poor labor practices or dealings with undemocratic tyrants. He did explain that there
has been a committee formed
to oversee Swarthmore
College's proxy votes in the
companies in which we invest.
When issues in those corpora-

tions are brought to a stockholder vote, Swarthmore's
voice will hopefully be an informed, responsible one.
Overall, student attitudes
towards the meeting seemed
positive. True to our community ideals, it seemed that no
one was afraid to ask a question, even though time limitations prevented some students
from speaking. It was clear
that Bloom enjoyed talking to
the students as well. He expressed very enthusiastically
his esteem and respect for
Swarthmore College and its
students.

coordinate in Hou's qigong to facilitate these benefits.
On the other hand, the workshop
)rovides an accessible, concrete avenue into traditional Chinese culture.
Qigong is practiced daily by some
200 million people in China, and
thousands of different forms exist. Its
roots run deep as well as wide, with
the tradition dating back over 2000
years and influencing, according to
some scholars, the development of
every facet of traditional Chinese culture
such as the marital arts, religion, architecture, and even the visual
irts. It is the backbone of Traditional
Chinese Medicine, and the source of
accupuncture theories and practice.
Masters of qigong, even and especially in their original setting, command tremendous respect for their
unique practices and skills. Even
China, a country of over a billion
people, lays claim to no more than
perhaps 1000 masters. The Chinese
Government recognizes these few
masters as one of China's "Four National Treasures."
North America boasts extremely
few authentic qigong masters, although there is no lack of neophytes

eager to claim qigong abilities. Minimally, training to reach the "Master"
level requires more than a decade of
daily practice, with up to six, ten,
twenty or more hours spent in training some days. Yet some consider this
actually easier than finding a master
worthy of studying under.
Qigong in the States is at times
clumsily lumped together alongside
"New Age" charlatinism and Indian
Yoga or various meditations, but this
is extremely inappropriate. Qigong
has been for two decades rigorously
studied in a range of clinical and laboratory settings, and produced results
both remarkable and mysterious. Its
verity is such that in China a number
of cases exist where complicated surgeries (ranging from three to six hours
in length) have been performed without the use of any anesthetic, using
only the emitted qi of a Master in its
place; no complications result, and
patients remain fully conscious
throughout the procedures (including
brain surgeries and thyroidectimies).
On a cultural level, a most fascinating encounter and exchange is occurring between the conventionally
juxtaposed fields of religion/subjective tradition and science/technology.
Hou looks forward to bringing this
lofty historical encounter down to
earth, and in the process inviting
people to, by way of their own experiences, participate.

stretches believability. One half-expects
to see him tying the female leads to train
tracks while he sneers under a curled mustache. Except in this case, the hero would
let them die while he conferred with advisors over what the actual meanings of
"train tracks" and "grisly death" are.
I suppose I should end a semester's

industry with something resembling final words of wisdom, so I'll ask you to
just keep this in mind: It's never "just"

Phoenix Picks: Music Reviews

Seam
The Pace is Glacial
Touch and Go
After three years of laying low,
Sooyoung Park and his band Seam
have put out a fourth album. In this new
work they continue their trend of energetic, weepy rock & roll. Though it's
packaged like a minimalist noise album
(Low comes to mind when one looks
at the cover photograph of gray sky and
telephone wires), the music is really
warm and beautiful pop which, though
introspective, is also emotive. The guitar here ranges from a tolling bell to a
grinding, beautiful crunch, and
Sooyoung's vocals pick at the soul in
that gritty, whiney voice which is so
popular yet so seldom successful (take
Jakob Dylan as example.) There are
plenty of long, cloying grooves on this
album of the sort one expects from
bands like Pavement or Fuck, ever retreading the same path in the same interesting way. The sound is honest,
consistently mellow even during the
more fiery of eruptions, and maybe
.confessional. The album even feels
kind of like a personal journal, though
the lyrics arenft really autobiographical. The long grooves, the quick explosions of emotion, the focus on repeated minutia, all are confined within
a certain defined space, as to a page.
This is the kind of music you might
make for yourself, so that later you can
sit in your room and stew in it, like
you're curing yourself with your own
smoke. This is not to say the album is
unpalatable or narcissistic; most of the
feelings this album turns over and
around are universal, and it's worthy
stewin' sound for just about anybody's
bedroom.

Chessie
Signal Series
Drop Beat
Stephen Gardner, formerly of the
"anti-rock" band Lorelei, is now
"Chessie," and he has put out a magnificent new electronica album on the
Drop Beat label. Full of throbbing
rhythms, haunting, bendy whirls, and
jazz-influenced space grooves, Signal
Stress is a brooder's dream. This is
near-perfect music to study to—there
are no distracting words, it's enjoyable
at any volume (including the "Don't
bother me, I have headphones on" one,)
and the intricate twistings and turnings
are unmatched for their ability to stimulate oneis nervous system to hyperactivity. This album is busy. Forget
crowded city streets moving at the
speed of time-lapse photography to the
music of Philip Glass, and instead
imagine an asteroid shower, a pounding surf, pulsating death rays, swarming ants, squawking birds, and collapsing bridges. This isn't the music of the
city; it's the music of total chaos, except it's beautiful and not as "difficult"
as truly cacophonous music would be.
The music isn't completely computer
generated; Gardner uses a real base and
guitar during most ofit, and sometimes
he uses real percussion, though he certainly runs the sounds through a goodly
number of pedal effects and computer
gizmos. His aim doesn't seem to be to
make an entirely binary album, but instead to make an album that makes due
with too much. His work asks the question, "How many good things can I put
in an omelet before it's not good anymore?" The omelet stays good most of
the time, and not only that, but once you
eat it, you want to have one every day.

Introducing

K

A new girl group out of Portland,
Oregon is on the scene; and it contains
members ofprevious girl groups. The trio
of Junior (sts of The Lookers), Dusty
(Sarah Dougher ofThe Lookers and The
Crabs), and Kissy (Corin Tucker of
Sleater-Kinney) has put out areally cool
new album which hearkens back to the
days of sixties girl groups. Junior plays
a trap set, Dusty sings and plays a $5O
Farfisa organ, and Kissy sings and plays
guitar. The band members may previously have been rebels, but never before
in overblown makeup and Fifth Avenue
clothes. Their songs, preoccupied with
the "teen girl" mentality of boyfriends
and sex worries, haven't seen die light
of day since the time of Marva Whitney
and the Shangri-Las. The new band consciously recycles these old themes and
methods to revitalize the tough girl movement that has been waning a little since
the heyday ofthe Riot Grrrl. Says Dusty,
"Because of the dynamic social situation
of women in the early-to-mid 60s that
ultimately culminated in the modern
feminist movement, the voices of women
who were talking about things like running away from home, having sex with
their boyfriends, started to be part of a
larger cultural voice... that's something
we dig about those groups." Cadallaca
uses the girl group form to explore concerns ranging from dyke love (in "O
Chenilla") to transgressive love (in
"Night Vandals.") The form comes together really well. One of the things
which makes this album great is that
Kissy and Dusty's singing voices are
highlighted. Whereas Kissy/Corin's
voice was often overwhelmed by the
instrumentals in Sleater-Kinney, here we
get to hear it in it's full glory. Both Kissy
and Dusty sing with the amazing, quivery
strength a friend of mine calls "an Indigo Girls voice," while I prefer to think
ofit as the voice of arunning park ranger
or a lifeguard on full alert. Whatever the
quality ofthe voices, it creates great stuff
on a fun new album.

Talent sets Twelfth Night apart
Mary Meiklejohn '99 takes the traditional
Shakespearan comedy into 19th century Mexico
by Carly Hammond
Staff Writer
What a night! On Friday, December 4, and Saturday, December 5, the
Swarthmore College Drama Board presented William Shakespeare's Twelfth
Night in the Lang Performing Arts Center. Talented actors, an extraordinary
set, and clever directing rounded out a
night full of excitement and comedy.
Mary Meiklejohn '99 directed the
performance, and chose to set the play
in 1800s Mexico. Cast member Steven
Salter 'O2 said of Meiklejohn, "She was
wonderful. She had an image but she
was also very flexible." Actor Melanie
Hirsch 'O2 was also very impressed
with Mary's technique, which included
sitting down to discuss a scene with the
actors and making sure that they understood it before acting it out.
Other key elements ofthis winning
performance were the beautiful costumes worn by the actors, designed by
Samira Mehta 'OO and Meiklejohn,
which conveyed the feeling ofthe time
period. In addition, the exquisite set,
created by Dave Ryan 'OO and his crew,
depicted a quaint Mexican town, complete with a church, tiled roofing, and
even a statue of Madonna (the Holy
Mother, not the singer). Hirsch commented that the set was "fun to work
with there were walls to avoid, and
plants everywhere." Finally, charming
Spanish music filtered through the
streets to lend ambiance to the decor
and draw the audience into the atmosphere.
Most importantly, exceptional acting by every player made this production entertaining and inviting to the audience. According to Hirsch, the cast,
which began rehearsing in early October, was strong because it was an ensemble, and there was no definite lead.
She adds, "We were all very well-suited
to our parts."
Hirsch delivered an impressive performance as Viola, a lady of Messaline.
Separated in a storm at sea from her
twin brother, Sebastian, cleverly acted
by Andrew Bryce 'OO, Viola comes to
Illyria in search ofher love, Orsino, the
Duke of Illyria. Aurelio Perez 'O2
played this part brilliantly, acting the
virile man who has fallen in love and
lost himself to passion. The object of
his affection is Olivia, played by Katie
Harper 'O2, who well portrayed this

wealthy countess, recently mourning
her brother's death. Dan Belsky 'O2
nearly stolethe show as Sir Toby Belch,
her uncle and a stumbling drunk with
a great sense of humor and a fondness
for practical jokes. With his sidekick,
Sir Andrew Aguecheek, acted by
Brantley Bryant '99, these two characters drew continuous laughs from the
audience. A crafty woman named
Maria, played by Laura Louison 'O2,
is a lady-in-waiting to Olivia, and another mischievous individual who likes
to play games. The audience also
greatly enjoyed the comedic performance ofChris Cutler 'OO as Malvolio,
a steward to Olivia who is highly enamored of her and very condescending to all others in the household. Sam
Blair 'O2 was ingenious as Feste, the
fool of the house, a witty comedian
who delighted the audience with his
jokes and songs. Salter was Antonio,
the sea captain who rescued Sebastian
in the storm, and he was also amusing
as Curio, servant to the patronizing
Duke. Tanya Wansom 'O2, as a priest,
and Alastair Thompson '99, as another
sea captain, completed an entertaining
and talented cast who won the audience
with their jests and made this performance of Twelfth Night especially remarkable.
In Shakespeare's story, Viola and
Sebastian are separated from one another in a storm at sea. Sebastian is rescued by Antonio and taken to Illyria,
where he mourns his twin: sister whom
he thinks has died at sea. Viola is also
rescued by a sea captain and led to
Illyria, where she hopes to find her
love, Orsino. In order to be close to
Orsino, Viola assumes the identity of a
man, Cesario, and acts as his servant.
Unfortunately, Orsino is madly in love
with Olivia, and his passion consumes
him; he uses Cesario as his messenger
and begs him to tell Olivia how much
he loves her.
Meanwhile, at the house of Olivia,
her uncle Toby is busy drinking with
his friend Andrew. Andrew has come
to the house in hopes of wooing Olivia,
but she seems not to notice. Andrew is
discouraged but Toby convinces him to
stay awhile longer and give it another
try; Toby is merely concerned with his
own entertainment, and keeps Andrew
around for fun.
When Cesario arrives with his
message, Olivia is still mourning her
brother's death and is in no mood to

way in to see her. In light of this rude
intrusion, Olivia reiterates that she cannot love Orsinc, despite his strong affection for her, and she bids Cesario
tell him that. At the same time, however, she cannot help but fall in love
with Cesario, and she asks him to come
again the next day.
Meanwhile, Maria, Toby, and Feste
are up their old tricks. Noticing that
Malvolio is in love with Olivia, Maria
writes a love note in handwriting very
close to Olivia's which appears to be
directed to Malvolio and instructs him
to wear yellow stockings and crossgarters and smile constantly. The
pranksters plant the note where
Malvolio finds itand he hurries to obey
the wishes of his true love, Olivia. He
wears the yellow stockings and crossgarters, both fashions that Olivia detests, and smiles like a fool, causing her
to think he has gone mad.
While this is happening, Olivia is
fawning on her love Cesario. Andrew
sees them together in the garden and is
further discouraged about his courting
of Olivia. Toby, however, convinces
him to write a challenge to Cesario,
which he will not deliver, and then the
two will meet in the garden for a duel,
a joke which Toby and Feste await anxiously. All this time, Sebastian has been
wandering around the town of Illyria,
bemoaning the loss of his twin sister.
When Olivia arrives at the scene ofthe
duel to stop the competitors, she sees
Sebastian, who looks exactly like
Cesario. She asks him to marry her
straight away, and he easily agrees.
The final scene of the play incorporates all of the characters, who meet
in the square. Casario/Viola and
Sebastian find each other and conduct
a small family reunion, Cesario revealing his true identity as the woman
Viola. Finding that his servant was actually a beautiful woman, Orsino forgets his claim to Olivia, and falls in love
with Viola. Olivia takes Sebastian, and
with Viola and Orsino, and Toby and
Maria, the happy couples depart to get
married. Thus, the lovers pair up quite
nicely, while all the characters, including Malvolio and his yellow stockings,
live happily ever after.
Says Salter of the production, "It
was definitely worth the time we put into
it." Without question, a superb cast,
coupled with talented direction and a
beautiful set, made this performance of

Seidman's composition 'Dha

conversation between the vocal chorus of the Kecak and
traditional Indian recitation.
In what began as a call and
response style dialogue the
opposing parties mimicked
each other, building the chorus to a crescendo that concluded in the amalgamation
of the two languages .
Culminating in what appeared to be a melee but was
instead a frenetic 'dancing

the audience, 'New Dialogues in Rhythm' was a de-

lightful and exotic breeze into

tame campus.
The Dance and Drumming

did nothing more than crowd
the stage and the juxtaposition
of the colorful costumes worn
by both ensembles was nearly
blinding; however, in the two
instances the groups effectively harmonized and performed together, attesting to
the value of intercultural musical exchange. The sheer
number of instruments and
performers on the stage at any
given moment was overwhelming and was matched
only by the vibrancy and animation of the performers.
In a concert well attended by members of the
immediate Swarthmore community and guests alike, the
Gamelan and Dance and
Drumming Ensemble succeeded in marking an auspicious beginning for any future collaboration of the two
ensembles.

what similar to Part, whose
writing is highly influenced
by traditional
sounds.
Martinu wished to step into
the grand scale of the symphonic form, but not in the
monstrous capacity ofMahler
or Bruckner.
This symphony is approximately twenty five minutes long, consisting of four
movements of equal length.
The Allegro moderato began
with tense energy and then
moved into a playful melody.
The brass shortly made their
first entrance and then disappeared into a dreary interlude
that resolved into a religious
warmth and then back into a
contained and uncertain
melody. The Andante
moderato is somewhat of a
cultural insignia, which drew
from Moravian folk tunes and
Janacek. At this point, one can
realize the excitement of the
piece when the "slow" movement is hardly that. A more
obvious representation of his
energy were the soft noises
that resulted from Jarvi's arms
rampantly stretching his suite.
The march-like Poco allegro began with a crashing
gong and a surge of muted
brass, which grew more excited and conveyed an optimistic theme simultaneously. The strings shortly
received this theme and performed it with the masterfully synchronous percussion. Jumping, sweeping,
and swinging on the po-

dium, Jarvi danced on the

podium with full force, as the

movement ended with furious crashing and gusto. The
Allegro elaborated the
charged sound of the previous movement with a fast
and bright theme localized
by the violins and contagiously spreading through
the string section. The brass
and percussion rushed in and
raised the level of fervor for
the ending. Jarvi mirrored
this energy, as he actually
leapt into the air, thrusting
down his baton and almost
touching the ground. He finished the symphony with
arms high above his head.
As the first two works
were built upon the distant
work ofclassical composers
of the previous century, the
concert ended with an actual
specimen. Jarvi had lead aremarkable musical experience
thus far and ended with a

Badminton team
ready to start the
season off right
Double scrimmage victories over
Haverford Fords prepare team
members for winning season
by Jennifer Z. Chen
Contributing Writer
Badminton started the 19981999 season off on the right foot.
After defeating Haverford's club
team in two scrimmages, the team
is now fully prepared to begin its
intercollegiate season by hosting
the Harcum-Swarthmore Invitational this Saturday in Tarble Pavilion.
This year's team is much stronger than last year's league championship team. Although it lost two
singles players, the team sees the
return of three Nationals qualifiers
and that of now-experienced young
talents. The new recruits on the
team have also added depth to the
line-up.
The overall improvement of the
team is mostly due to the efforts
of head coach Dan Sears and assistant coach
Dan Hamilton.
Sears had spent
the
summer
studying videotapes of Olympics badminton
competition to
see
how he
could raise the
skills level of
his
team.
Hamilton, who
was recently hired by the Athletic
Department, brings years of badminton experience and expertise
that have helped to transform the

have paid off. Hamilton said, "Our
returning players are playing stronger than ever and our season hasn't
even started!" Most players are
also playing with the goal of winning the conference and advancing
to the nationals.
Because of the level of their
commitment to improve, Sears
projects that this team has "a good
chance to win the conference." He
also said, "This team is heavily de
pendent on the seniors, who occupy
the first singles and the firs
doubles seats."
However, the ranking couh
change during the season as th
younger players develop. Wendy
Kemp '99, first-singles, faces challenges from Noelle Goodin 'OO,
Cathy Vaughan 'Ol and Xiang Lan
Zhuo'ol. Meanwhile, the doubles
line-up should remain the same as
last year with Erika Johansen '99
and Jennifer
Chen '99 as
first doubles
and Jane Ng 'Ol
and Siobhan
Carty 'Ol as
second doubles.
However, Phil
Thomas 'Ol,
Karen Lange
'O2,
Olga
Rostapshova
'o2 and Eve
Gilman 'O2 could create a major
shake-up. Also, the newly recruited Lurah Hess '99 will give
everyone, literally, a run for their
money with her athletic abilities.
The two men players provide
greater competition than ever before.
The double threat of Jai Shin '99 and
Brendan Karch 'O2 generates intensity and rivalry in every game situation. If the team continues on its
rampant path towards improvement,
then the 1998-1999 season will definitely produce many Nationals-calibre players by April.

Heather Kile 'O2, a starting forward on the women's basketball
team, has taken the Centennial Conference by storm and has already
generated much talk among opposing coaches and players. Averaging
21.3 ppg and 13.3 rpg, Kile leads the
conference in both categories and
ranks highly in several others, including field goal percentage (.474),
free throw percentage (.707), and
steals (2.57 per contest). She was
recently named the Most Valuable
Player of Swarthmore's Inaugural
Tip-off Tournament and was also selected to the Seven Sisters' All-Tournament Team over the weekend for
a trio of stellar performances that led
her team to a third place finish, the
Garnet's best showing since 1989.
Before suiting up in the Garnet
uniform, this New Jersey native
played four years of varsity basketball at Holy Cross high school. She
also played on the Delaware Valley
Raptors for two years, during which
time the team finished 12thand 13th
at Nationals. En route to amassing
1070 points and 781 rebounds, she
earned several awards including AllParochial '96-'9B, All-Burlington
County '96-'9B, Scholar-Athlete
Award '95-'9B,
and All-South Jersey Honorable
Mention '97.
One might expect a player with
such a distinguished resume to have
an air of arrogance about them, but
nothing could be further from the
truth when speaking about Kile.
"Heather is an amazing basketball
player, but she is an even better
teammate," commented Adrienne
Shibles, Kile's coach. "She is driven
to improve her own game, but she is
passionate about playing as a team
and developing a winning tradition
for this program."
"My favorite part of the game
of basketball is the team concept that
is essential for success," Kile said.
"On the court there are five players

who are so unique and different, but they
must commit to the system and operate
as 0ne....1 love how everyone comes to
together and is willing to do whatever it
takes to win the game."
Herfavorite aspect of a contest is the
physical play in the paint, at which she
does battle regularly. Teammate Emily
Gray 'O2 attests to Kile's strength in the
key, "She is the most talented post player
that I have ever encountered in my years
of playing the sport. She has a presence
and she hurts you with it. She is the 'real
deal.' She could probably out-muscle
even the American Gladiators."
While the success of the team rests
largely with Kile's consistently strong
performances, she is the first to attribute
the squad's early success to others.
"It starts'with a superior coaching
staff that values each and every
player's contribution to the team.
They work on creating a positive en-

vironment. I have found that the
veteran players help the first-years
to learn what is expected as a part
of this team. Their leadership and
encouragement is an invaluable
part of our success," she commented.
The versatile, talented post,
who plans to major in math, is confident that the team can continue
its winning ways. "The team wants
to improve on last year's record. The
future of the program looks very good.
We have a young team, and the more
we play together, the better we will
become," she said.
Personally, Kile aims to always
give one-hundred percent and accept
nothing but her best. "I think that if
our team practices and plays with a
lot of intensity, good things are going
to happen!" With Kile in uniform, one
can be sure good things of that.

Non-conference win prepares
squad for standout season
by Anne Frankenfield
Staff Writer
This past weekend, the
Swarthmore wrestling team
traveled to New York for their
first dual match of the season
against SUNY Maritime. The
Garnet topped SUNY with a
team score of 38-18 with an
impressive individual and
team effort.
Frank Yeo 'Ol
and
Sam
Picard 'Ol received forfeits at 125
lbs and 133
lbs respectively, putting
Swarthmore
on top immediate 1 y ■

Kahn finished 6th at 174 lbs.
The Garnet have yet to
wrestle a Centennial Conference match, but now have a
good look at what the future
holds in store. Although they
suffered some setbacks in preseason tournaments, this
weekend's match puts things
in a new perspective. With talented freshmen and experienced veteran
team members, Swarthmore should
be a team not
to be overlooked and
are guaranteed to be a
tough competitor both in
and out of the
Centennial
Conference. After wrestling
his first collegiate match,
McManimen is confident
about the rest of the season and
feeling that the team is "very
talented and should place well
within the Centennial Conference."
Swarthmore will be idle
until their first match of the
new year over winter break.
On January 9th, they will host
the Team Challenge Tournament at 11:00 am against
Albright College, Millikan
University, Trinity College and
Washington and Jefferson College. On the 13th, they will
travel to Centenary College for
a dual match 7:00 pm, and then
host teams such as Ursinus
College, Wesleyan University,
Williams, and John Hopkins
on the 16th at 10:00 am for the
Swarthmore Invitational. Until then, the Garnet will travel
to Montreal Canada for their
intensive training trip from
December 28th until January
7th. Come out and show your
support for the men on their
road to a successful season.

Team closes semester
with 2-1 overall record

SThe

Freshman

Mike Evans, 157 lbs, wrestled
strong to beat Brent Carney
with 10-8 decision, after falling to a 7-0 deficit in the first
period. Senior Captain Matt
Kahn (174 lbs) and Ted Chan
'O2 (165 lbs) recorded falls,
while Keith McManimen 'O2
maintained a Technical Fall
(win by 15) to push Swarthmore ahead. Freshman Justin
Pagliei (285 lbs), clinched the
team's victory when he pinned
his opponent just 1:10 into the
bout. On the success of his
new teammates, Kahn commented, "This is by far the
best group of freshman we've
had in the past ten years. To
have freshmen record two
pins, one tech fall, and one
amazing come-from-behind
victory in the first dual meet
of the year is unheard of."
On an individual note, just
before Thanksgiving, Swarthmore
wrestled in the
Montclair Invitational on
January 21st. Adrian Wilson
'99 placed 2nd at 141 lbs, losing only to the defending National Champion in the finals.

back it up." Swarthmore did
though, with several players
making huge contributions.
Kile led the Garnet with 22
points and 17 rebounds,
while Katie Tarr 'O2 added
12 points and 5 boards.
Heather Marandola 'Ol and
Jean Quinn '99 grabbed 9 rebounds a piece. Coach
Adrienne Shibles commented, "We got some quality minutes from the reserves, including Christina
Ciambriello 'O2, who scored
11 points, and Emily Gray
'O2 and Caitlin Ryland 'O2,
who combined for 15
boards." The collective effort resulted in the team's
accomplishing two major
goals they had set for themselves: they out-rebounded
St. Joe's 66 to 47 and limited the Blue Jays to 28%
shooting (compared to their
own 40%).
The victory paired the
squad against the Smith Pioneers, the defending champions since 1995. The Garnet
took an early lead in the contest, but Smith's powerful
posts managed to score easily
no matter what the team did
to try to stop them. "The
game against Smith was
tough," commented Shibles.
"We never really clicked. It
was obvious that we were
playing NOT to lose, rather
than playing to win." "The

game could have easily gone
the other way," added
Ryland. "We missed a lot of
easy shots early on that had
a huge impact on the final
minutes of the game. Also,
poor foul shooting in the
first half really hurt us in the
end."
Kile had a career high
night, scoring 29 points in
the loss, and she grabbed a
dozen boards as well. Tarr
tossed in 10 points. The
Garnet failed to repeat their
good work the night before
in accomplishing standard
goals. The squad was out-rebounded 27-35 and they allowed Smith to shoot 49%
from the floor.
The game to decide third
place was deciding more than
one game's victor: according
to Seven Sisters policy, the 4th
and sth place finishers swap
seeds the following year as
the 4th place team finishes
the tournament 1-2 while the
sth place team finishes with
a 2-1 record. To assure
themselves of a high seed
next year, a victory was necessary.
Coach Shibles, concerned
that the team would repeat
their poor showing, challenged the leadership of the
returning players in the postgame talk. "This team is so
close off the court that I
think individuals are afraid

to step up and take control
on the court," she said. "I
was so impressed with the
way the team responded on
Sunday. I was proud of all
of them, but especially of
senior forward Jean Quinn
and sophomore point guard
Kristen English." Quinn set
the tone on the defensive end
by taking a series of charges,
and English took charge of
the offense by burying 5 of
11 three-pointers on her way
to scoring 18 points. Kile
had 16 points and 10 rebounds, and Marandola
chipped in 15 points. With
"all five cylinders firing at
the same time," Gray noted
that "we were playing the
best basketball of the year.".
All-Tournament selection
Kile, who posted 94 points and
53 rebounds in four games last
week, believes that the team will
continue their winning ways after break. Right now the team
has the momentum to win a lot
of games. The chemistry is
great. We all get along and everyone is so supportive. Every player has an important
role and in the last game everything seemed to come together. We heed to keep that
momentum over our time off.
The season has just begun and
improvements need to be
made, but overall everyone
seems very confident in our
ability to win a lot of games."
