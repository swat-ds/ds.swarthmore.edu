# Fair Hill Burial Ground Interments
This is the register of interments, 1843-1981, at Fair Hill, a Philadelphia burial ground administered by Quakers. Fair Hill was one of the first racially integrated cemeteries in Philadelphia, and is the final resting place of many prominent women's rights activists and abolitionists (both Quaker and non-Quaker), including Lucretia Mott and Robert Purvis.

## About Fair Hill
The land which is now Historic Fair Hill was part of a large territory given in 1691 by William Penn to his friend George Fox, the English founder of Quakerism, for use as "a stable, a Meetinghouse and burying place." In 1703, the original Meeting House was built. The first burial was probably just a few years later, but the original cemetery, much smaller and slightly to the east, is lost to history. The current property, bounded by Germantown Avenue, Cambria Street, Indiana Avenue, and 9th Street, was fenced in as Fair Hill Burial Ground in 1842. In May of 1843, a 19 year old tuberculosis victim named John Hare was the first person to be interred in the newly expanded burial ground. Eight others were interred that year. The burial ground became mostly inactive by the end of the 1970s, although the records show some ashes being added to family plots as late as 1981.

Fair Hill was one of the first racially integrated cemeteries in Philadelphia, and both Quakers and non-Quaker were buried here. The rules of the burial ground included guidelines for ‘simple’ funerals and specifications for the size of headstones — no more than 18 inches wide, 9 inches deep, and 10 inches out of the ground. This practice was in keeping with the Quaker tradition of simplicity.
