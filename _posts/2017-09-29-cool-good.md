## Recommend me some Brazilian music plz

I am learning Portuguese and it would be nice to have some songs to listen to. So far I only like a couple of Caetano Veloso's stuff and the band Los Hermanos with Rodrigo Amarante. Also that pop song we all know called "Ai si eu te pego"...basically I wanna get into pop music but YouTube playlists have yet to lead me to my new faves. Send me ur rex if you have 'em!
